No damage shows any blood, only smokepuffs.\n\nThe orbs power source is taken from colored diamonds found in the caves: Green for Earth, Red for Fire, Blue for Water and White for Air.\nThere are also some diamonds with combined orb energy effects: Light Blue for Air & Water and Purple for Fire & Earth.\n\nThe underground Kingdom is divided into 50 platform levels, to finish a level three larger Key-diamonds must be found; one each of Green, Red and White color - these will open the door to the next level.

The player can switch from person to person while moving the characters around each scrolling puzzle, and teamwork is essential to success.\n\nTasks can include finding objects (like a spear) on the screen, or trying to reach a specific destination which may require the use of objects you have discovered so far. Each level has a time limit, when time runs out the level can be restarted.","tags":[268435464,268435465,268435487,536871717,536871878]},{"id":132903,"aggregated_rating":76.0,"cover":{"id":114834,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co2glu.jpg"},"name":"Pendragon","platforms":[{"id":6,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"},{"id":14,"name":"Mac"}],"screenshots":[{"id":400439,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc8kzb.jpg"},{"id":400440,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc8kzc.jpg"},{"id":400441,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc8kzd.jpg"},{"id":400442,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc8kze.jpg"},{"id":400443,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc8kzf.jpg"},{"id":400444,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc8kzg.jpg"}],"summary":"Pendragon is a turn-based strategy game, where every move you make drives the narrative, and every story twist opens new gameplay opportunities.\n\nWill you advance and show your mettle, or cautiously retreat?

A fossil park is hosting a large-scale tournament in which competitors enter vivosaurs created from dinosaur fossils into competition. Fossil Fighters from all over the world battle their vivosaurs against one another to find out who will be crowned champion.\n\nPlayers excavate and clean fossils. New giant fossil rocks (containing complete dinosaur fossils) and odd fossil rocks (which are two-sided) add to the fun of the cleaning process.\nOnce the fossils have been cleaned, they can be revived into Vivosaurs, which players can then arrange into teams for battles. The better the fossils have been cleaned, the more powerful the Vivosaurs are in battle.\nStrategy is key in battles. Players must put forth teams of three vivosaurs, then rotate their positions to maximize their power advantage over opponents.\nNew “super evolver” vivosaurs evolve into new forms with the help of gold fossils.\nPlayers can compete in matchmaking battles or upload their best team to see how it fares against others.

Laser obstacles, strange switch targets and gates to pass through will put you in a spin as you try to find the fastest way through the game's levels.","tags":[268435488]},{"id":194906,"cover":{"id":214109,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co4l7h.jpg"},"name":"The Adventures of Poppe","platforms":[{"id":3,"name":"Linux"},{"id":6,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"},{"id":14,"name":"Mac"}],"screenshots":[{"id":759128,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scg9qw.jpg"}],"summary":"A 2D adventure platformer game where a little man named Poppe explores different locations, finds various items and uses them along his way, fights against dangerous insects and survives in this gigantic world.","tags":[1,268435464,268435487,268435488,536871389,536873926],"videos":[{"id":65887,"video_id":"71WF5sBg2BY"}]},{"id":24308,"cover":{"id":181281,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co3vvl.jpg"},"name":"Are You Smarter Than A 5th Grader?: Make the Grade","platforms":[{"id":20,"name":"Nintendo DS"}],"screenshots":[{"id":678530,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scejk2.jpg"},{"id":678531,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scejk3.jpg"},{"id":678532,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scejk4.jpg"},{"id":678533,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scejk5.jpg"},{"id":678534,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scejk6.jpg"},{"id":678535,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scejk7.jpg"},{"id":678536,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scejk8.jpg"}],"summary":"Based on the TV game show.

It was the first NBA 2K game to be released multi-platform on the series, and also the last to be on the Sega Dreamcast.

The player controls a starfighter that can move left and right along the bottom of the playfield. Enemies swarm in groups in a formation near the top of the screen, and then begin flying down toward the player, firing bombs at the fighter. The game ends when the player's last fighter is lost, either by colliding with an enemy or one of its bullets, or by being captured.\nGalaga introduces a number of new features over its predecessor, Galaxian. Among these is the ability to fire more than one bullet at a time, a count of the player's \"hit/miss ratio\" at the end of the game, and a bonus \"Challenging Stage\" that occurs every few levels, in which a series of enemies fly onto and out of the screen in set patterns without firing at the player's ship or trying to crash into it. These stages award a large point bonus if the player manages to destroy every enemy.\nAnother gameplay feature new to Galaga is the ability for enemies to capture the player's fighter. While the player is in control of just one fighter, a \"boss Galaga\" (which takes two shots to kill) periodically attempts to capture the fighter using a tractor beam. If successful, the fighter joins the enemy formation. If the player has more lives remaining, play resumes with a new fighter. The captured fighter flies down with the enemy that captured it, firing upon the player just like normal enemies, and can be shot and destroyed. The player can free the fighter by destroying the boss Galaga while in flight, causing the captured fighter to link up with the player's current fighter, doubling his or her firepower but also making a target twice as large.\nGalaga has an exploitable bug that can cause the attackers to stop firing bullets at the player, due to a coding error. In addition, similar to the famous \"Split-Screen bug\" in Pac-Man, a bug exists in Galaga in which the game \"rolls over\" from Level 255 to Level 0. Depending on the difficulty setting of the machine, this can cause the game to stall, requiring that the machine be reset or power-cycled in order to start a new game.","tags":[18,268435461,268435489,536871049,536871078,536871470,536871859,536871882,536871971,536872205,536872352,536872651,536873064,536873186,536873991,536875046,536875075,536875076,536875158,536875434,536875666,536875902,536876120,536876362,536876391,536876435,536876545,536876657,536876714,536876909,536876930,536876953,536877049,536877277,536878084,536878192,536879069,536881117,536882121,536882478,536883988,536884018,536885038,536901402],"videos":[{"id":23935,"video_id":"jFuU0QYlDcA"}]},{"id":37285,"cover":{"id":154347,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co3b3f.jpg"},"name":"NBA Live 95","platforms":[{"id":13,"name":"PC DOS"},{"id":19,"name":"Super Nintendo Entertainment System (SNES)"},{"id":29,"name":"Sega Mega Drive/Genesis"},{"id":58,"name":"Super Famicom"}],"screenshots":[{"id":78298,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/td9gvc7wd9tiyu84z0tw.jpg"},{"id":78299,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/nyvodrbv1d8bpiu6p9nd.jpg"},{"id":78300,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/dxb2yologhhervunez7n.jpg"}],"summary":"The first of the NBA Live video games series.

Groups of highwaymen and monsters populate the Overland Map and the farther from civilization the player roams, the more difficult the encounters become.\n\nThe 15-hour campaign in Neverwinter Nights 2: Storm of Zehir is also packed with new classes, spells, creatures, and playable races.","tags":[17,268435468,536871139,536871208,536871938,536872074,536872257,536872435,536872449,536872471,536872647,536874994,536875044,536875161,536875169,536875184,536875196,536875199,536875214,536875215,536875265,536875300,536875302,536875330,536875336,536875380,536875453,536875455,536875525,536875531,536875735,536875738,536875778,536875793,536875798,536875803,536875891,536876093,536876286,536876301,536876376,536876392,536876503,536876546,536876571,536876583,536876606,536876612,536876706,536876883,536877422,536877423,536877532,536877593,536877614,536877617,536877628,536877766,536878355,536878358,536878494,536878525,536879227,536880270,536880479,536880579,536880907,536881078,536881122,536882019,536882130,536882209,536882427,536882869,536883426,536883988,536884507,536885416,536885417,536885418],"videos":[{"id":1702,"video_id":"1SFePqAp314"}]},{"id":142494,"cover":{"id":209037,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co4hal.jpg"},"name":"Dragon Ball Card Warriors","platforms":[{"id":6,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"},{"id":48,"name":"PlayStation 4"},{"id":49,"name":"Xbox One"}],"screenshots":[{"id":418156,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc8yng.jpg"},{"id":418157,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc8ynh.jpg"},{"id":418158,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc8yni.jpg"}],"summary":"Choose your Saiyans , draw your deck, and get ready for Dragon Ball Card WARRIORS - The in Depth/Fast paced strategy card game that's easy to learn and INCREDIBLY FUN!

But because of the dark thoughts in people's minds, the Nightmare was born and threatened to end the world. A brave sage appeared and, by using the Holy Instruments and the Dream Stone, sealed the Nightmare away into the holy land. Peace was restored but the world is now separated into the real world and dream world.\n\nYears later, people forgot what has happened, and only recalled the events as a legend. Many have also heard about the Dream Stone sealed within the Temple of Dreams. Enter our hero, Rumble, a Ruinseeker (a high ranked treasure hunter) who wish to find the Dream Stone. At the same time, in the Dreamworld, a Baku (a weird looking animal that lives in the Dreamworld) who Rumble later names Tumble accidentally drops the box which holds 7 keys to the seal of the Temple. The keys went and hid in different people's dreams. To retrieve them, one must enter the dream and seek out the keys. Tumble can enter the dreams but there are many monsters within dreams and puzzles that he may need help with. Rumble realize he must get the keys in order to find the Dream Stone. Seeing that the two can help meet each other's goals, Rumble and Tumble decides to work together.\n\nIn Dual Hearts, Rumble and Tumble will travel around Sonno Island, meeting the people there and seek out those whose dreams holds one of the seven keys. Each dream is different as each person is different, which means that the enemies and puzzles Rumble will encounter will be different in each dream he visits. Within the dreamworld, everything is filled with gold and gems - even the boss is a giant money bag.\n\nWithin the dreams, Rumble will be able to use the Holy Instruments (in the form of a spear and sword) to fight enemies there. Rumble can use both weapons at the same time enabling him to do a variety of combo attacks. Tumble will help Rumble by carrying him on his back, enabling him to reach higher planes. He can also perform different attacks like the Breath Attack.\n\nIn order to advance, there are a variety of puzzles for our heroes to solve. For example, in one puzzle, you will be presented with movable blocks, several switches and a closed door. You must figure out which switch will open the door and move the block on the switch. If you run into any problems, you can always talk to Tumble or the Dream Sheep for hints and help.","tags":[1,268435487,536871138,536871213,536871301,536871889,536871938,536871939,536873082,536874398,536874745,536875073,536875298,536875309,536875488,536875621,536875689,536875695,536875803,536875944,536876266,536876353,536876504,536876847,536877049,536877494,536877628]},{"id":39644,"cover":{"id":123695,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co2nfz.jpg"},"name":"Cosmo Gang the Video","platforms":[{"id":5,"name":"Wii"},{"id":52,"name":"Arcade"},{"id":58,"name":"Super Famicom"}],"screenshots":[{"id":757174,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scg88m.jpg"},{"id":757175,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scg88n.jpg"},{"id":757176,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scg88o.jpg"}],"summary":"Cosmo Gang the Video is a fixed shooter arcade game based on the redemption game Cosmo Gang.","tags":[18,27,268435461,536871078,536871262,536875181]},{"id":114156,"aggregated_rating":60.0,"cover":{"id":84380,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co1t3w.jpg"},"name":"SUCCUBUS","platforms":[{"id":6,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}],"screenshots":[{"id":282724,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc625g.jpg"},{"id":282725,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc625h.jpg"},{"id":282726,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc625i.jpg"},{"id":282727,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc625j.jpg"},{"id":282728,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc625k.jpg"},{"id":282729,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc625l.jpg"}],"summary":"Become a demonic priestess of lust and use her unique skills to take revenge on your enemies.

Is it possible that there is a traitor in their midst?\n\nThe stealth and thievery game, Thief: Deadly Shadows comes with a number of improvements over two previous parts. Released in 2004, it left behind the aging Dark Engine, using a heavily modified Unreal engine instead. Realistic lighting effects have been implemented: each character and object now casts its own shadow. A third person's view has been made available in addition to the standard first person perspective.\n\nThe stealth system that made Thief: The Dark Project and Thief 2: The Metal Age famous is still in place. You have to stick to the shadows and avoid making noise, as guards will react to anything suspicious. It is also the first game of the series that introduced free roaming. The City, divided into several unlockable districts, is yours to explore. You can interact with the city's inhabitants: pickpocket, steal, or even mug them for loot.","tags":[1,17,23,268435461,268435469,268435487,536870928,536870934,536871044,536871139,536871186,536871208,536871280,536871617,536871818,536871926,536871937,536871945,536872070,536872352,536872581,536872647,536872871,536872959,536874115,536875050,536875229,536875242,536875257,536875271,536875304,536875437,536875525,536875639,536875682,536875760,536875792,536875796,536875803,536875804,536875807,536875814,536875830,536875902,536875941,536876032,536876086,536876087,536876093,536876121,536876168,536876220,536876429,536876606,536876609,536876695,536876726,536876731,536876804,536876911,536876914,536877155,536877172,536877275,536877400,536877512,536877531,536877566,536877614,536877649,536877652,536877964,536878259,536878410,536879718,536879915,536880288,536880292,536880294,536880520,536882198,536883087,536883191,536883350,536884022,536884027,536884207,536884208,536884209,536885213,536886087,536886089,536886090,536887300],"videos":[{"id":523,"video_id":"iPm8uUdPRjo"}]},{"id":109877,"cover":{"id":188217,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co4189.jpg"},"name":"General Practitioner","platforms":[{"id":6,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}],"screenshots":[{"id":252932,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/socbkpzrwm4fovv7jcle.jpg"},{"id":252933,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/zxpjsd1gl3h0q3jovils.jpg"},{"id":252934,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/zuworzssog5qccrz3hpi.jpg"},{"id":252935,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/saphyqtrmiqmp65uiz00.jpg"},{"id":252936,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/xhzchnqwiqztpjqrq7yp.jpg"},{"id":252937,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/tvksp0iij2tne3dusw7n.jpg"},{"id":252938,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/f9zbzvsg3lt0gobekozn.jpg"},{"id":252939,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/zn1mk4hrmc0eq2row7w3.jpg"},{"id":252942,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/uw7tobrysfhwxlaadvty.jpg"},{"id":252944,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/hcwdoqpcbk513fatyg08.jpg"}],"summary":"Live the everyday life of a General Practitioner: go to the clinic every day and meet new patients, develop your skills through study and manage your clinic and your staff.

Interactive Entertainment, which takes place in the world of J.R.R. Tolkien's Legendarium.\n\nThe game takes place in the 60-year gap between the events of Tolkien's The Hobbit and The Lord of The Rings. It is a story of revenge, slaughter, and mystery set entirely in Mordor, the Land of Shadows. At its center is Talion, an ordinary man who loses everything, including his mortal life.\n\nThe game is set in a fully open world, and features various role-playing game elements such as experience points and skills. There are various ways the player can complete their main objective. Aside from the main storyline, there are various side quests and random events the player can complete within Mordor.\n\nThe melee system is inspired by that of the Batman Arkham series. Getting into a good fighting rhythm, using both regular attacks and counter-attacks will improve the player's combo multiplier.\n\nA unique feature of Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor is the Nemesis system. Every enemy in the game has their own name, rank, and memory. These enemies will continue to do their own jobs and tasks even when they're off screen. If the player does not kill an enemy in an encounter, this enemy will remember the player and change their tactics and conversations based on the encounter.","tags":[1,17,23,38,268435468,268435481,268435487,536870928,536870934,536870976,536871006,536871008,536871029,536871044,536871063,536871117,536871139,536871208,536871213,536871244,536871301,536871402,536871504,536871506,536871535,536871784,536871939,536871945,536872070,536872205,536872222,536872225,536872257,536872371,536872393,536872406,536872419,536872628,536872668,536872883,536872898,536872978,536873053,536873079,536873154,536873162,536873192,536873326,536873327,536873384,536873914,536873999,536874115,536874134,536874706,536874743,536874822,536874831,536874916,536875046,536875047,536875050,536875062,536875073,536875081,536875157,536875197,536875199,536875228,536875229,536875231,536875243,536875257,536875265,536875266,536875271,536875294,536875304,536875306,536875307,536875308,536875316,536875324,536875385,536875437,536875453,536875455,536875485,536875490,536875492,536875494,536875496,536875523,536875536,536875623,536875657,536875668,536875695,536875755,536875760,536875762,536875776,536875781,536875782,536875792,536875804,536875808,536875822,536875830,536875831,536875889,536876007,536876078,536876171,536876174,536876217,536876220,536876227,536876228,536876229,536876266,536876273,536876276,536876281,536876321,536876355,536876495,536876601,536876650,536876704,536876706,536876712,536876723,536876755,536876813,536876826,536876911,536876938,536876942,536876964,536877032,536877047,536877077,536877109,536877111,536877125,536877221,536877275,536877383,536877495,536877595,536877597,536877600,536877649,536877762,536877955,536878064,536878246,536878257,536878264,536878277,536878329,536878372,536879011,536879066,536879174,536879751,536880068,536880168,536880205,536880206,536880207,536880285,536880286,536880287,536880288,536880289,536880290,536880292,536890625,536890626],"videos":[{"id":2203,"video_id":"0oyQkIbifRg"},{"id":2204,"video_id":"ny8vCIJaX30"},{"id":2761,"video_id":"OpgXI57QL-c"},{"id":6073,"video_id":"2El_FkVfhOE"},{"id":6074,"video_id":"Qmba2EyOh4Y"}]},{"id":47578,"cover":{"id":223936,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co4ssg.jpg"},"name":"Top Hunter: Roddy & Cathy","platforms":[{"id":5,"name":"Wii"},{"id":79,"name":"Neo Geo MVS"},{"id":130,"name":"Nintendo Switch"}],"screenshots":[{"id":177042,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/bmbie597c93ngribjppz.jpg"},{"id":177043,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/mukawozxubpwqnu4g6nn.jpg"},{"id":177044,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/dybatnlgviq7bxiwaliy.jpg"},{"id":177045,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/gzuvejpsw0nqkwozxpzt.jpg"},{"id":177046,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/lealilmqolnyoknz2ppe.jpg"},{"id":177047,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/hlmeffxajrc8t1h7m2to.jpg"}],"summary":"Clean up the Space Pirates!

Collect gems, squash and shoot the fauna, fall deeper into the infinite well, and wear some other equally large and ballistically designed shoes.\n\nSuper Absolver Mini: Turbo Fighting Championship\n(2 Players Only)\nA competitive fighting game where you play as your choice of one of four masked combat disciples. You choose two special moves. You fight two rounds. The winner is absolved of the obligation to ever have to fight again, but probably will anyway because the one true resolve of the flesh is a fist colliding with it.\n\nCatsylvania\nIt’s a cat inside of a suit of armor.
