Howard's Conan the Cimmerian stories, Age of Conan: Hyborian Adventures is a fantasy themed massively-multiplayer online role-playing game (MMORPG) that immerses players in a dark, expansive universe filled with ground-breaking brutal combat, dangerously intoxicating magical abilities, and the social and cooperative game features that MMORPG players crave.\n\nSet in the later years of Conan's life, after he has famously become king by his own hand, the game centers around the fragile state of Conan's rule in Aquilonia. Surrounded by enemies and hostile nations, Conan's rule hangs by a thread and in the end, it's up to players, either singly or backed by their guilds to turn the tide for or against the embattled king.\n\nMassively Multiplayer Gaming for the Adult Player: One of the most highly anticipated MMORPGs in recent years due to the strength and familiarity of the Conan franchise across a variety of major media, Age of Conan: Hyborian Adventures is the first of several releases planned for the franchise, all of which are aimed at an adult audience. Firmly rooted in the savage, bloody, violent and sexy Hyborian universe, players can expect a graphically beautiful game blended with gritty gameplay that is true to both the barbarian hero from Howard?s writings and the Schwarzenegger influenced version from books, movies and comics.\n\nAvailable Cultures and Classes: Although Age of Conan contains a wide range of peoples, its playable cultures are currently limited to Aquilonians, Cimmerians, and Stygians. Within each of these players can choose from a selection of archetypal character classes, although available classes and subsequent subclasses are not necessarily the same within each culture. For example, archetypal classes for Aquilonians and Cimmerians are Rogue, Priest and Soldier, while Stygians are represented by Rogue, Priest and Mage. Further differences exist within subclasses for each. See the basic breakdown of all three cultures below:\n\nAquilonians: Internally divided, but united against their barbarian neighbors, the Aquilonians live lives on the edge. Their kingdom, with its prosperous cities, enlightened culture and religious freedom, is known as the \"Flower of the West.\" Yet for all this and despite the power of King, Conan I, it is a land where culture clashes and unrest are always a threat.\n\nCimmerians: As the Hyborian Age comes to an end the northern barbarian clans of the Cimmerians know that the end of their time is drawing near too. King Conan I of Aquilonia is himself a Cimmerian, though not typical of his people. Although his life has been filled with wanderlust, his Kin care nothing for what occurs outside their clan territories.\n\nStygians: Masters of the magical arts and ruled by their consuming worship of the serpent-god Set, the Stygians excel at occult and diabolic lore. They learned long ago that true power lies in knowledge and in pacts with dark powers. This single-mindedness has allowed them become the only culture to harness the secrets of the Mage class and power that comes with it.\n\nModes Singleplayer as well as Multiplayer: Unlike most MMORPGs, Age of Conan: Hyborian Adventures includes a significant singleplayer experience as well as deep overarching multiplayer gameplay. This is an atypical MMORPG feature, but one that has a purpose. Players enter the game as a lowly galley slave with no memory of his/her past, and over the first five to 20 levels of singleplayer action build the skills necessary to survive in the game's multiplayer levels. During this time you will traverse a variety of rich environments including jungles, deserts, mountains, valleys, dungeons and cities packed with NPCs, beasts and monsters, before eventually leveling up and moving back to your chosen culture?s homeland. Because the only character-related choices that players have to make at the game?s opening are their looks, clothing and culture, this singleplayer mode is important in deciding what class and subclass to pursue and thus the level of impact your character will have in greater multiplayer portions of the game.\n\nIn-game levels 20 and above are strictly multiplayer. 20-40 introduce players to guilds. 40-60 deal with large scale combat. 60-80 have the player interacting with King Conan and levels 80 and up represent end-game play. Here gameplay changes as social aspects of MMORPG gameplay take over on a large scale.\n\nReal-time Combat That Takes Queues from the FPS: Traditionally MMORPGs have utilized a mix of auto and turn-based functionality in their combat systems, but Age of Conan dispenses with that, instead drawing inspiration from FPS/action games. Firmly rooted in the brutality of the Hyborian universe, game developer Funcom has devised an action-based system that not only provides the sense of actually being in the fight, but also requires the player to participate in it. That means no simple targeted attacks. Players can attack and defend from nearly any position in real-time, whether on the ground or atop a mount, while standing still or on the move. It?s a recipe for carnage and one that fits right into the world of Conan.\n\nThe combat system in Age of Conan comes in three forms: drunken brawling, mini games like CTF and massive Player vs. Player battles, which lets you engage in siege combat to defend or attack a city. All are easy to learn, but difficult to master, providing hours worth of play and replay value and are the core of this new cutting edge MMORPG.","tags":[1,17,268435468,268435487,536871041,536871044,536871138,536871139,536871148,536871208,536871213,536871283,536871301,536871409,536871470,536871535,536871812,536871931,536872070,536872205,536872245,536872435,536872440,536872647,536872733,536872873,536872898,536873066,536873089,536873224,536873297,536873364,536873384,536873947,536874040,536874343,536874398,536874831,536875042,536875046,536875054,536875095,536875106,536875142,536875169,536875173,536875184,536875214,536875243,536875257,536875271,536875278,536875302,536875304,536875309,536875311,536875331,536875380,536875420,536875453,536875455,536875523,536875543,536875556,536875639,536875679,536875735,536875766,536875791,536875798,536875799,536875804,536875831,536875891,536875896,536875897,536875932,536876027,536876210,536876232,536876266,536876281,536876286,536876355,536876356,536876388,536876413,536876430,536876478,536876503,536876546,536876550,536876551,536876617,536876629,536876694,536876718,536876730,536876748,536876974,536876986,536877032,536877165,536877207,536877208,536877209,536877288,536877422,536877423,536877617,536877628,536877951,536877956,536878073,536878074,536879132,536879898,536880004,536880294,536880383,536880421,536880564,536880624,536880706,536880753,536880871,536881009,536881044,536881122,536881350,536881372,536882285,536883035,536883301,536883995,536884018,536884021,536886997,536886998,536886999]},{"id":516,"aggregated_rating":80.0,"cover":{"id":79673,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co1ph5.jpg"},"name":"Of Orcs and Men","platforms":[{"id":6,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"},{"id":9,"name":"PlayStation 3"},{"id":12,"name":"Xbox 360"}],"screenshots":[{"id":432,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/ahnrvqpfqtnmb8lseqgv.jpg"},{"id":433,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/gyvxfzfugne1s3oky5pf.jpg"},{"id":434,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/hmnvlaeadqc3zshwj3ud.jpg"},{"id":435,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/lmgqzdkkrwbelwc9pdn6.jpg"},{"id":436,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/ff1oedtjrusdqvxmvv0j.jpg"}],"summary":"Of Orcs and Men first puts the player into the role of an elite Orc soldier, Arkail, from the legendary legion of Bloodjaws.

A Goblin, Styx, soon joins the player, an unlikely but indispensable ally.","tags":[1,17,268435468,536871008,536871041,536871044,536871139,536871208,536871864,536871938,536871945,536872070,536872647,536872847,536873053,536873066,536873384,536873473,536873810,536874916,536875046,536875047,536875062,536875099,536875157,536875161,536875196,536875199,536875253,536875265,536875281,536875302,536875306,536875307,536875316,536875372,536875425,536875437,536875464,536875492,536875494,536875593,536875609,536875623,536875668,536875792,536875808,536875809,536875910,536876008,536876707,536876770,536876911,536876981,536877531,536877643,536878359,536878415,536878470,536878512,536878525,536878531,536879087,536880299,536880303,536880958,536882816,536888127,536891823,536891824],"videos":[{"id":2250,"video_id":"I-C3LBUoQw8"},{"id":2251,"video_id":"y9T6hdS9Q-Y"},{"id":2252,"video_id":"IedPilgoINE"}]},{"id":153532,"cover":{"id":154638,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co3bbi.jpg"},"name":"Starboy Adventures","platforms":[{"id":6,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}],"screenshots":[{"id":679331,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scek6b.jpg"},{"id":679334,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scek6e.jpg"},{"id":679337,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scek6h.jpg"}],"summary":"Your dog has been kidnapped, and that's reason enough to kill everyone.\n\nA run and gun where in a series of challenging stages you kill everything in your path looking for your lost dog that was mysteriously kidnapped by a mysterious pigeon.","tags":[1,268435461,268435464,268435487,268435489,536871939,536873186,536889635,536900112],"videos":[{"id":51504,"video_id":"G7_KuJZ-Ptk"}]},{"id":47706,"cover":{"id":51484,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/o6fczq1faxp2ktcieyxi.jpg"},"name":"UNO 52","platforms":[{"id":20,"name":"Nintendo DS"}],"screenshots":[{"id":681302,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scelp2.jpg"}],"summary":"America's favorite family card game is mixed with the modern poker craze to create Uno 52.

The game places emphasis on racing on stunt tracks and features a track editor, it is clearly influenced by the earlier arcade game Hard Drivin' and has many similar elements to the game Stunt Driver which was released around the same time.\n\nIn Stunts, players race a lap around the circuit, with the aim of completing the lap as quickly as possible without crashing. However, these laps often feature special track areas such as loops, jumps (including over tall buildings), slalom roads and corkscrews. The game area is restricted by a large fixed size square area defined and surrounded by a fence which the game is designed to prevent the player from leaving. Players can either race against the clock or choose between six different opponents; there is no support for real-time multiplayer. Stunts features 11 different drivable cars, with either automatic or manual transmission. Replays of races can be saved and reviewed. There are four camera views available during replay and actual driving, and the dashboard is an optional overlay on all views. It is also possible to continue the race from any point in the replay, however the time for that race will not be recorded. Another major feature of the game is the built-in track and terrain editor which allows the user to design arbitrary new tracks or modifications of existing tracks.[2]\n\nThe cars can drive on paved roads, gravel roads, icy/snow roads, and grass if driving off the track — which all offer different levels of grip. The game has a relatively advanced pseudo-physics engine for its time which can simulate oversteer and understeer, grip is also proportional to the banking of a curve. The game features a 3D engine with flat shading and no textures, it uses polygonal graphics for most objects, including trees and road signs, there are few sprites. The resolution is 320×200 with 256 colors. There is an option to select high and low detail. The game is written for DOS and executes in real mode.[3]\n\nStunts includes a form of copy protection. Each time after running the program, players must complete a specific phrase found in the game manual before being allowed to race. If the player fails to complete the phrase three times, the next race will still load. However, approximately four seconds into the race, the player is informed that he or she did not deactivate the car's security system, the car crashes, and the player is returned to the main menu.","tags":[268435466,268435470,536871067,536871221,536872078,536872371,536872695,536875061,536875069,536875185,536875857,536875901,536877676,536880220,536880877,536882049,536882171,536882172,536882173,536882175],"videos":[{"id":4980,"video_id":"322vyU2lfu0"}]},{"id":191431,"cover":{"id":209131,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co4hd7.jpg"},"name":"Slow Mole","platforms":[{"id":18,"name":"Nintendo Entertainment System (NES)"},{"id":23,"name":"Dreamcast"}],"screenshots":[{"id":738470,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scftt2.jpg"},{"id":738471,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scftt3.jpg"},{"id":738472,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scftt4.jpg"},{"id":738473,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scftt5.jpg"},{"id":738474,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scftt6.jpg"},{"id":738475,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scftt7.jpg"},{"id":738476,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scftt8.jpg"},{"id":738477,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scftt9.jpg"}],"summary":"Slow Mole is a minimalistic platformer.

The main character is able to side-step and block some attacks, but in general shares with the other protagonists of the series their relative ineptitude in combat.","tags":[1,18,19,21,268435465,268435487,536870928,536870984,536871041,536871044,536871071,536871088,536871109,536871115,536871127,536871133,536871251,536871470,536871878,536871882,536871939,536871945,536872014,536872032,536872105,536872201,536872225,536872435,536872587,536872647,536872715,536872746,536872748,536872983,536873154,536873327,536873362,536873591,536873787,536873904,536873947,536873973,536874115,536874182,536874398,536874745,536874872,536874873,536875050,536875057,536875058,536875074,536875097,536875157,536875158,536875178,536875216,536875228,536875229,536875245,536875249,536875271,536875275,536875330,536875358,536875372,536875390,536875400,536875426,536875437,536875453,536875483,536875495,536875502,536875503,536875512,536875523,536875524,536875525,536875528,536875535,536875538,536875542,536875572,536875574,536875621,536875623,536875624,536875639,536875692,536875731,536875760,536875767,536875792,536875800,536875803,536875808,536875819,536875830,536875833,536875837,536875847,536875870,536875871,536875893,536875904,536875934,536875941,536875944,536876014,536876086,536876087,536876125,536876168,536876176,536876179,536876199,536876221,536876287,536876322,536876327,536876338,536876348,536876349,536876445,536876499,536876511,536876538,536876615,536876631,536876646,536876647,536876650,536876850,536876875,536876878,536876910,536876911,536876982,536876984,536877014,536877037,536877049,536877173,536877237,536877238,536877264,536877303,536877324,536877394,536877407,536877452,536877494,536877536,536877560,536877592,536877741,536877853,536877967,536877986,536878005,536878008,536878085,536878096,536878097,536878193,536878209,536878255,536878317,536878400,536879093,536879187,536879207,536879859,536879895,536880285,536880357,536880654,536880655,536880845,536880865,536880888,536881061,536881087,536881102,536881248,536881449,536881528,536882493,536882765,536882898,536883035,536883681,536884023,536884027,536884029,536884411,536884412,536884413,536884414,536884840,536886096,536886097,536886885,536886918,536886919,536886920,536886921,536886922,536886923,536887629],"videos":[{"id":455,"video_id":"9s5t6R3aWwY"},{"id":36145,"video_id":"MLo2WtNN69Q"}]},{"id":154767,"cover":{"id":192399,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co44gf.jpg"},"name":"Kellogg's Gut Bacteria Reef","platforms":[{"id":6,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}],"screenshots":[{"id":513587,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scb0ab.jpg"},{"id":513591,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scb0af.jpg"},{"id":513593,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scb0ah.jpg"},{"id":513597,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scb0al.jpg"},{"id":513599,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scb0an.jpg"}],"summary":"Explore the human gut like never before!","tags":[268435487]},{"id":23077,"aggregated_rating":81.6666666666667,"cover":{"id":181124,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co3vr8.jpg"},"name":"Anno 1701: Dawn of Discovery","platforms":[{"id":6,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"},{"id":20,"name":"Nintendo DS"}],"screenshots":[{"id":372499,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc7zf7.jpg"},{"id":372500,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc7zf8.jpg"},{"id":372501,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc7zf9.jpg"},{"id":372502,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc7zfa.jpg"},{"id":372503,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc7zfb.jpg"},{"id":372504,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc7zfc.jpg"},{"id":372505,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc7zfd.jpg"}],"summary":"A unique and award-winning combination of construction, economy, discovery, diplomacy, and combat.\nCreate your own nation with a unique blend of simulation and real-time strategy as you journey across the globe to explore, trade, and learn technologies to expand your empire and to make your own history.\nMeet the Orient!

Separated from his family, Opoona is forced to live alone. On the planet, Opoona must find a job, search for his siblings, and defend himself and the people of Landroll against creatures known as the Dark Rogues. Luckily for Opoona, he is the descendant of a long line of warriors known as the Cosmo Guards. Thus, Opoona’s adventure begins as he struggles to establish a new life and reunite his family.\n\nThe game’s action-oriented battle system lets players use powerful “Energy Bonbons” against their enemies. Using just the Nunchuk, players can manipulate an Energy Bonbon’s trajectory in a number of different ways. All of Opoona’s commands are also controlled by the Nunchuk, to allow a complete “single-hand control” of the game.\n\nOpoona is not just about battling; it is a “Lifestyle RPG.” As Opoona, players must adapt to a new environment, meet new people, and contribute to society through work, all while becoming aware of the precious world and people around him. As the game progresses, Opoona will develop relationships and uncover a broader range of activities including new jobs and clues to new adventures.","tags":[1,17,18,27,268435464,268435465,268435468,536871262,536871325,536871417,536871506,536871826,536871835,536871882,536871938,536872211,536872217,536872257,536872404,536872617,536872961,536873021,536873024,536873787,536875073,536875074,536875075,536875130,536875196,536875286,536875300,536875322,536875356,536875380,536875453,536875455,536875639,536875691,536875764,536876088,536876243,536876436,536876496,536876960,536877073,536877554,536878078,536878147,536878217,536878402,536878483,536880364],"videos":[{"id":3857,"video_id":"4MAc0C-oF8Y"},{"id":3858,"video_id":"w28MrqoEY7I"}]},{"id":3231,"aggregated_rating":65.8,"cover":{"id":185700,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co3zac.jpg"},"name":"Below","platforms":[{"id":6,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"},{"id":48,"name":"PlayStation 4"},{"id":49,"name":"Xbox One"}],"screenshots":[{"id":3738,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/ld0wfbxnzeg3bnxyrlas.jpg"},{"id":3739,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/uikcvsoctwm0qafzjruu.jpg"},{"id":3740,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/mgztuodlo1llf6xtcb50.jpg"},{"id":3741,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/zjg84j8kgjr6o1ysi6uu.jpg"},{"id":3742,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/a5xkgevei0uigcm0klla.jpg"},{"id":291470,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc68we.jpg"},{"id":291471,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc68wf.jpg"},{"id":291472,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc68wg.jpg"}],"summary":"Test your adventurer mettle against The Isle’s procedural subterranean labyrinths.

It was released on November 21, 2003 and is a reboot of the landmark video game series Prince of Persia, created by Jordan Mechner in 1989.\n\nThe Sands of Time, developed internally at Ubisoft Montreal, successfully captures the mechanics of the original platformer and extends it to the 3D generation. An earlier attempt by The Learning Company to transfer the game to 3D (Prince of Persia 3D) was released in 1999, but despite its initial good reception failed to sell enough and the company responsible for the original trilogy was already closing doors. The game was praised for its visual design, finely tuned game mechanics and intriguing storyline, winning the game several awards.\n\nThe game was developed for the PC, PlayStation 2, GameCube, Xbox, and later a 2D-version for the Game Boy Advance and mobile phones. The success of The Sands of Time led to three followups, Prince of Persia: Warrior Within (2004), Prince of Persia: The Two Thrones (2005), and Prince of Persia: The Forgotten Sands (2010). A remastered, high-definition, version of The Sands of Time was released on the PlayStation Network for the PlayStation 3 on November 16, 2010.","tags":[1,268435464,268435487,536871049,536871082,536871088,536871139,536871208,536871213,536871301,536871302,536871470,536871738,536871758,536871865,536871945,536872010,536872070,536872257,536872961,536873053,536873067,536873384,536873674,536874190,536874209,536874398,536874943,536875047,536875050,536875073,536875081,536875089,536875092,536875095,536875101,536875133,536875157,536875199,536875242,536875257,536875301,536875306,536875405,536875437,536875453,536875454,536875456,536875523,536875531,536875621,536875638,536875689,536875693,536875755,536875760,536875768,536875778,536875805,536875819,536875830,536875840,536875868,536875902,536875934,536876006,536876011,536876199,536876266,536876351,536876359,536876476,536876511,536876545,536876584,536876599,536876606,536876611,536876695,536876703,536876735,536876755,536876874,536876881,536876929,536876987,536877016,536877047,536877049,536877056,536877230,536877294,536877410,536877628,536877658,536877659,536877764,536878256,536878264,536878387,536878505,536878507,536878523,536878600,536879092,536879123,536879761,536879764,536879806,536879894,536879895,536879992,536880274,536880294,536880441,536881716,536882765,536883035,536883318,536883319,536883320,536883321,536883778,536883870,536883899,536884027,536884207,536884472,536884474,536884494,536885901,536886180,536886183,536887250,536887251,536887252],"videos":[{"id":32505,"video_id":"P5XaqjHPPVQ"},{"id":32506,"video_id":"eeoqc2d4CUM"},{"id":32507,"video_id":"8S5DVt_wo3g"}]},{"id":200447,"cover":{"id":220749,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co4qbx.jpg"},"name":"When you wish upon a star","platforms":[{"id":6,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}],"screenshots":[{"id":789355,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scgx2j.jpg"},{"id":789356,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scgx2k.jpg"},{"id":789357,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scgx2l.jpg"},{"id":789358,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scgx2m.jpg"},{"id":789359,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scgx2n.jpg"},{"id":789360,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scgx2o.jpg"},{"id":789361,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scgx2p.jpg"},{"id":789362,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scgx2q.jpg"}],"summary":"\"When you wish upon a star\" is a visual Nobel in the genre of love comedy that unfolds the story through the player's choice.","tags":[27,31,44,268435469,268435488,268435490,536871006,536873186,536873512],"videos":[{"id":67764,"video_id":"Wrapj5zfSxA"}]},{"id":7058,"aggregated_rating":52.5,"cover":{"id":111779,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co2e8z.jpg"},"name":"Lost: Via Domus","platforms":[{"id":6,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"},{"id":9,"name":"PlayStation 3"},{"id":12,"name":"Xbox 360"}],"screenshots":[{"id":27003,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/br5hnilwcsgrf2vriqrm.jpg"}],"summary":"In Via Domus, players control Elliott Maslow, another survivor of the Oceanic flight 815 plane crash.

There's a giant boulder headed your way, too.","tags":[1,22,27,268435466,268435471,268435488,536870947,536870989,536871063,536871123,536871244,536871262,536871506,536872070,536872119,536872120,536872205,536872245,536872407,536872419,536872817,536874398,536874694,536874743,536874916,536875011,536875046,536875047,536875063,536875069,536875073,536875089,536875122,536875142,536875197,536875202,536875208,536875253,536875271,536875298,536875305,536875309,536875319,536875322,536875393,536875396,536875404,536875523,536875638,536875639,536875798,536875885,536875887,536875951,536876021,536876031,536876034,536876054,536876062,536876063,536876126,536876205,536876237,536876261,536876263,536876287,536876315,536876319,536876409,536876435,536876474,536876509,536876556,536876651,536876711,536876820,536876851,536877677,536878007,536878201,536878512,536879787,536880863,536882675,536882694,536883598,536883599,536888127,536889368,536892091,536892092],"videos":[{"id":1329,"video_id":"fwGeq-CMf4w"}]},{"id":191407,"cover":{"id":209089,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co4hc1.jpg"},"name":"Live A Live","platforms":[{"id":130,"name":"Nintendo Switch"}],"screenshots":[{"id":738305,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scftoh.jpg"},{"id":738306,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scftoi.jpg"},{"id":738307,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scftoj.jpg"},{"id":738308,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scftok.jpg"},{"id":738309,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scftol.jpg"},{"id":790708,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scgy44.jpg"}],"summary":"Previously unreleased outside of Japan, the RPG game Live a Live is releasing on the Nintendo Switch system in the HD-2D style!\n\nSeven different stories featuring different protagonists, time periods, and gameplay styles await.

This version introduces some new tricks, updates some features, and brings depth to some game modes from previous Madden titles.\n\nThe 07 game focuses on the Running Back by giving you lead blocker controls. After selecting a running play, you can cycle through offensive players to open up gaps. New evasive maneuvers are controlled with a separate stick to elude defenders, along with new juking and spinning maneuvers.\n\nStart a career with your favorite NFL team, draft the players, call the plays, and lead your team to a dynasty. Or, make your own player and guide him on and off the field through his entire career starting with the draft. If you do not want to mess with all the options and features you can simply sit down for a quick game.","tags":[268435469,268435470,536870938,536870939,536870944,536870945,536871049,536871186,536872060,536872078,536872205,536872245,536872352,536872637,536872673,536873274,536873350,536875073,536875138,536875140,536875157,536875186,536875265,536875271,536875312,536875364,536875435,536875456,536875464,536875494,536875525,536875562,536875659,536875749,536875802,536875819,536875870,536875941,536876386,536876485,536876694,536876762,536876821,536876948,536877108,536877144,536877432,536877440,536877686,536877953,536878091,536878092,536878093,536878111,536878125,536879120,536879121,536879122,536879648,536879649,536879650,536879651,536879652,536879654,536879655,536879656,536879657,536879658,536879659,536879660,536879668,536879669,536879670,536879673,536879874,536880134,536880425,536880798,536880839,536881505,536883028,536883035,536883831,536884018,536885147]},{"id":27196,"cover":{"id":139762,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co2zua.jpg"},"name":"Attack on Titan: Escape from Certain Death","platforms":[{"id":37,"name":"Nintendo 3DS"}],"screenshots":[{"id":790053,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scgxlx.jpg"},{"id":790054,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scgxly.jpg"},{"id":790055,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scgxlz.jpg"},{"id":790056,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scgxm0.jpg"},{"id":790057,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scgxm1.jpg"}],"summary":"Attack on Titan: Escape from Certain Death is a visual novel and game made for the Nintendo 3DS.

The power-ups are hidden underneath mountains, rocks, and houses. Nearly everything can be shot at and destroyed. The heroes are, in order:\n\nRay Jack, the Knight, who possesses strong attacking power; Kaliva, the Wizard, who is good with magic and jumping; Barusa, the Monster, who has a strong defense; and Toby, the Thief, who can move swiftly.\n\nIt is necessary to keep all four heroes alive for the fifth and final stage, because there are certain points that the group cannot get past if one of the party members has died.","tags":[1,17,22,268435461,268435489,536871063,536871078,536871208,536871938,536875046,536875308,536875434,536875879,536876348,536877036,536879806],"videos":[{"id":28030,"video_id":"I67gXVEd63g"}]},{"id":174941,"cover":{"id":185278,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co3yym.jpg"},"name":"Chezzle","platforms":[{"id":6,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}],"screenshots":[{"id":657882,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sce3mi.jpg"},{"id":657883,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sce3mj.jpg"},{"id":657885,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sce3ml.jpg"},{"id":657888,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sce3mo.jpg"},{"id":657890,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sce3mq.jpg"}],"summary":"An endless, thought provoking, meditative Chess puzzler with a twist.

It was initially released January 2019 for the PlayStation 4 and the Xbox One. An expansion, Kingdom Hearts III Re Mind was released in January 2020. \n \nThe story takes place after the events of Kingdom Hearts 3D: Dream Drop Distance. It features an older Sora as the main protagonist, who sets forth on a new adventure to search for seven guardians of light in an attempt to stop Xehanort from bringing about a second Keyblade War. Sora is joined by Donald Duck, Goofy, Mickey Mouse, Riku, Kairi, and others. Along the way, Sora travels to many worlds from Disney and Pixar intellectual properties, and cross paths with the real Organization XIII. \n \nKingdom Hearts III features hack and slash combat reminiscent of Kingdom Hearts II, with elements from later handheld entries, allowing the player to control Sora in a party with Donald, Goofy, and up to two other Disney characters from the various worlds he visits. A major addition compared is the Formchange mechanic, which allows his currently equipped Keyblade to grant him special abilities and change shape. Sora can equip up to three Keyblades at a time, and cycle between them to use his abilities. Another addition is the Attractions mechanic, which occasionally allows Sora to summon and pilot a vehicle inspired by Disney theme park attractions. At certain points throughout the game, the player will be able to control other characters.","tags":[1,17,31,35,268435468,268435481,268435487,536870990,536871208,536871557,536871872,536871938,536871987,536873066,536873154,536873384,536873422,536874398,536874745,536875011,536875043,536875073,536875074,536875081,536875265,536875437,536875819,536875830,536875886,536875934,536876007,536876208,536876241,536876329,536876763,536876976,536877075,536877129,536877130,536877131,536877132,536877133,536877134,536877135,536877136,536877137,536877138,536877139,536877140,536877598,536879206],"videos":[{"id":20494,"video_id":"gPtU_-N6dMg"},{"id":20607,"video_id":"MRR30GSWZjc"},{"id":23046,"video_id":"EunHzNTCpx8"},{"id":23170,"video_id":"0YSPmzVqfpQ"},{"id":23767,"video_id":"a-fmsw5m0Ag"},{"id":23768,"video_id":"lz1w_uW3lSE"},{"id":24259,"video_id":"EElFaj4ezUU"}]},{"id":169633,"cover":{"id":186755,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co403n.jpg"},"name":"Eco Hole","platforms":[{"id":6,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}],"screenshots":[{"id":623057,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scdcr5.jpg"},{"id":623059,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scdcr7.jpg"},{"id":623062,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scdcra.jpg"},{"id":623066,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scdcre.jpg"},{"id":623070,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scdcri.jpg"}],"summary":"Eco Hole is a survival game for one or two players with unique gameplay.
