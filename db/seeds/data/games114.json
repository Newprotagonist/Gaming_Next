The hot sierra wind blew open the swing door to the old saloon bar... A scream echoed through the night air... The old Navajo witch doctor was right. Emily Hartwood\u0027s life was at risk. A sudden crack... A Winchester being loaded... Carnby drew his six-shooter... Empty!\n\nThe hell of his boot split into pieces. He had to find cartridges... Quickly! The moon began to cloud over. Carnby rushed out. His shoulder hit against a stone object. The statue of Jed Stone towered above him. He felt the second bullet tear into his back... Slowly, he tumbled into the darkness... Alone, Alone in the Dark!",

Like in the film, their main plots center on former Vietnam-era Green Beret John Rambo being recalled up to duty one last time to rescue his former commander, Colonel Sam Trautman, who was captured during a covert operation mission in Soviet Union-controlled Afghanistan. The console versions are developed and published by Sega, the PC DOS version was developed by Ocean and published by Taito and Ocean developed and published the rest (Atari ST, Amiga, Spectrum, C64, Amstrad). Taito also released an arcade game based on the film.",

    "summary": "In this game you play the role of an endurance bike racer. The gameplay involves you racing against the clock to get to the finish line and jumping over ramps. At the end of each race you get points for how many cars or bikes you have overtaken with which you can upgrade your bike. There are various different terrain for you to race on including desert beach and dirt tracks plus a number of things to slow you down or even knock you off of your bike all together. The main idea is to find the best route through each level to shave off valuable seconds in order to over take more cars and bikes. \n \nThe Japanese version of the game has more Tracks than the European and US versions have. Among them is a snow track which is one of the hardest tracks in the game, because there is a lot of stones on the thin road.",

Also a few action scenes are present in the form of small shooting sequences. \n \nIn this episode, Fenimore and Rhiannon find a dying man in the middle of the desert, who tells them of the whereabouts of a treasure from a recent theft hidden inside a tomb, just before passing out. \n \nJust after that a gang of outlaws lay an ambush on them, kidnapping Rhiannon. Our objective will be not only to rescue the poor girl and getting hold of the treasure, but also to pay vengeance on the villains.",

It is the first Family Feud video game to be released on Xbox 360 and the third to be developed on Wii by Ludia Inc.\n\nIn Family Feud, one hundred people were surveyed and gave answers to various questions. Two families then battle each other by trying to guess the top answers to each question. In each round, a member of each family is asked to join the host on the center of the stage to answer one question. The quickest player to buzz in gets to answer first. If he/she doesn\u0027t give the number one answer, the other player can give his/her answer as well. Whoever has the best answer will then decide to either \"play\" or \"pass\". If the player decides to play, his/her family will have to guess all the answers to win the round. If the player decides to pass, the opposing family will have to find all the answers. \n\nEach wrong answer results in a strike. After three strikes, the other family has a chance to steal the points. To do so, they must find one correct answer that hasn\u0027t already been given. When all the rounds are over, the family with the most points gets to play \"fast money\". In \"fast money\", the player is asked to answer the five same questions twice (or in multiplayer mode, two players can each answer the set of five questions). If the player gets 200 points or more in the \"fast money\" round, he/she wins $20 000!\n\nFamily Feud: 2012 Edition includes over 2000 survey questions, three difficulty levels (easy, medium, hard), a party mode with up to 4 players, bonus videos featuring Steve Harvey and lets the player play as his/her avatar on Xbox 360 or Mii on Wii.\n\nIn challenge mode, 1 to 4 players can play cooperatively against 16 different families. Each family has its own themed alcove (a beach, a mansion, a spaceship, a prehistoric den, a haunted house, a private boat, a bowling alley, etc). In party mode, 2 to 4 players can compete against each other.\n\nKinect features were developed for the game on Xbox 360, but were eventually dropped as they didn\u0027t add any fun factor to the game. It was then decided to also port the game to Wii.",

Virtually every important soccer league in the world is included in this game, with some countries not only having premier / first division, but 2nd, 3rd, and more divisions. All important international competitions are also included (club- and national-team based). The game has a career mode, where you may play up to 20 seasons as player manager or manager only. During a career as a coach you\u0027re not tied to one club / national team, meaning if you\u0027re good enough one (or more) big clubs make offers to you to coach their team.\n\nAll teams featured in this game have real players (names, strengths, weaknesses, etc.) from the 1994/1995 season. The management part of the game allows you to buy any of these players (which number 24,000 in total) if you have enough money and a free slot in your team. Besides the player manger career, you may play friendly matches, single season of any competition, and custom competitions, which can be made from scratch or based on a real one. Teams participating in these competitions can be chosen from any country. All the teams may be played by human player or computer.\n\nThe DOS version is based on Amiga version 1.1 with the data of season 1995/1996. 1.1 adds the ability to switch between player-manager and manager-only status before each match of a career and improved on-pitch skills enhanced for the player teams. Also the athletes\u0027 statistics improve by consistent goal-scoring.",

The action/turn based combat means that battling monsters is not just about using the right skills, but becomes an elegant Pas de Quatre of strategic positioning. Players form their parties with familiar Etrian Odyssey classes, customize individuals using Etrian-style skill trees, and then take up to four members into the dungeons.

He loved two things in this world: rock and his childhood friend Yui Hoshimoto. But attempts to improve relations with both always turned out a total disgrace for him. After one more fail he promised Yui that he\u0027ll form his own band and became \"bright like the sun\" to make her love him... \n \nSecond stage is, in a way, a continuation both for Souta\u0027s story and original Kira Kira story. It tells about preparations for the large concert celebrating the 5th anniversary of Murakami\u0027s group, Happy Cycle Mania and bonds all old and new characters together.",

    "summary": "Doom64 EX is a reimplementation of Doom 64 by Samuel \"Kaiser\" Villarreal. It is based on Doom3D, though rewritten for OpenGL rather than DirectX, and including some bug fixes from Boom and MBF. It aims to recreate the look and feel of Doom 64 as closely as possible, based on specifications obtained through reverse engineering, similarly to how Kaiser also created SvStrife. \n \nThe first public version of Doom64 EX was released on July 10, 2008. \n \nCompared to the Doom 64: Absolution TC, the principal difference is that Doom64 EX uses the original data. A tool provided with the port can create a DOOM64.WAD IWAD from the ROM. \n \nDoom 64 plays almost identically to earlier games in the Doom series; the player must advance through numerous levels fighting demons, collecting weapons and keys and hitting switches in order to reach the level\u0027s exit while surviving deadly traps and ambushes. Changes were made to the Doom engine for use in Doom 64, and gameplay elements were altered. \n \nWeapons \nAll the weapons from the original game are present, but redrawn with new sprites. The chainsaw was given two blades instead of one, the fists have bloodstained gloves on instead of brass knuckles, the plasma rifle has an electric core that emits a sparking sound when equipped, the rocket launcher has a small kick when fired, pushing the player back a bit, the shotgun\u0027s reloading cock is at the handle instead of under the barrel and the Super Shotgun reloads faster and causes recoil. \n \nA new weapon known as the Laser, or \"Unmaker\", was added, using the same cell ammunition as the plasma rifle and BFG. It was first mentioned in the Doom Bible and was planned to be featured in the PC Doom games but never appeared. Its appearance in Doom 64 is its only official appearance. With the power of three ancient artifacts found in the game, it becomes more powerful by shooting three laser beams (at a quicker rate than default) instead of one. The first artifact increases the laser speed, the second artifact adds a second laser and the third artifact allows the weapon to fire three simultaneous lasers which can automatically aim separately from one another, allowing the weapon to attack three different enemies at once. \n \nPlot \nFollowing the conclusion of the original Doom series, the sole Marine who survived the horrors of hell had returned to Earth, reclaiming it from the invasion that almost eradicated the human race. Demons still lingered within the abandoned halls and complexes of Phobos and Deimos. As a last-ditch effort, the military decided to bombard the moons with extreme radiation in hopes of killing off any remaining demons. Initially it was successful, however something survived the exposure. The radiation blocked the military\u0027s sensors and allowed something to slip past them undetected. This mysterious entity, possessing the ability to resurrect any demon it came across, recreated the entire demonic horde and made it stronger than ever before. A Marine strike force was ordered to contain the advancing armies of hell but was mercilessly slaughtered within moments. The player\u0027s character is the sole survivor of this group.",

    "summary": "Mobile Suit Gundam: Journey to Jaburo is an action game based directly on the Mobile Suit Gundam films and series. The game begins at the start of the series and ends at the ending of the second film. The game plays in an action game format with a standard third person view. It features newly hand animated cutscenes that depict events from the original television series as well as a CGI opening depicting a space battle from the One Year War and then a scene of the Gundam destroying several Zaku IIs before being attacked by Char Aznable. It is also the prequel to Mobile Suit Gundam: Encounters in Space. \n \nThe English dub of the video game features the voices of the actors who were cast for the Mobile Suit Gundam television series as with most games subsequent to the series\u0027 dubbing, rather than the English cast of the films. \n \nJourney to Jaburo takes place during the One Year War, and depicts the crew of the White Base making their way from the Side 7 sector of space colonies to the Federation headquarters at Jaburo. The game starts at Amuro Ray\u0027s home of Side 7, where three Zaku mobile suits attack the Federation\u0027s prototype mobile suit weapons. Amuro, in the confusion, fights the Zaku units in the Gundam, and is assigned to the White Base as the Gundam\u0027s pilot. After the White Base leaves the colony, it is pursued by Char Aznable, \"The Red Comet\". \n \nChar attacks the White Base during re-entry (where the power of the Gundam\u0027s beam rifle was revealed), which diverts them into the Zeon-controlled territory of North America. After going through many Zeon defenses (including Garma Zabi in Seattle), the White Base heads into Asia, where they battle Ramba Ral, an ace pilot who raised Sayla Mass when she was a child. After Ramba Ral commits suicide by jumping into Gundam\u0027s hand with a grenade, the White Base crew makes their way to Belfast for repairs. \n \nAfter they leave Belfast, they eventually make it to Jaburo, where Char\u0027s \"Mad Angler\" squadron finds the location of the base, and launches a massive attack to conquer it. The Zeon forces are beaten back, and the White Base, now dubbed the \"13th Autonomous Mobile Squadron\", heads out into space.",

Once all the monsters are rescued, aliens begin to invade the earth, leaving the monsters the only ones who can save the planet they just helped partially destroy. After fending off the invasion on Earth, the monsters rescue Myukus (a cyclops-like alien) from Area 51 before chasing the aliens through space, destroying the aliens\u0027 bases throughout the Solar System and eventually rampaging through their homeworld."

Use your bodies from previous attempts as pieces of the puzzle as you help yourself reach greater heights and far-away platforms.\n\nPlay as our beloved crash test dummy and pass through various levels to test the lab’s fantastic inventions! Turret in your way? Put a body in the trash compactor and now you have a shield! Can’t get to the platform above you? Jump on the trampoline bodies to reach new heights! A spike pit that’s too long and you’re lacking ammo? A sphere body is all you need to roll on the spikes with, without taking damage!\n\nLose yourself in this 1920’s futuristic art deco world as you wonder how to get past all the shiny and cool obstacles in your way. Shimmering gold and silky-smooth marble pave the walls and floors of these expensive labs. Within, hear the roars of the turrets decimating everything in their path, the ‘whoosh’ of wrecking balls swinging by you as you try to avoid them, the ‘ztztzt’ of the electric flooring that vaporizes all material on it, and the signature sound of the Vacuum Gun, sucking up bodies and making new ones!\n\n“But why?” you ask. Why create this lab and these machines and these obstacles? Well, just like life, humans fail constantly. But we often forget to see the good in failing – it\u0027s meaningful. Lab Rags is built on this philosophy – that failure is good. Use your previous knowledge and past experiences to get over the next obstacle. Your past failed attempts literally help you in Lab Rags as your position, manipulate and shoot your bodies to cross, solve and advance!\n\nWe at Salt Mine Studios wish you the best and welcome you to our lab. Have fun!",

You are armed only with a spacesuit and a shockwave pistol. To retrieve the crystals, you will need to find your way through numerous mazes. Blocks in the maze can be moved with the shockwave pistol. When you hit a block with the pistol, this will move blocks adjacent to the block hit rather than the block itself. If numerous blocks are lined up, the shockwave will continue to travel through the blocks until the path is clear and a block can be moved. Some blocks are indestructable and immovable, while others can be moved, and some completely destroyed. Teleportation doors, force fields and other special items can be found in some mazes. To complete most of the levels the blocks will need to be moved about in the proper order to avoid leaving a critical path permanently blocked. If you do get stuck, there is an option to restart a maze (this feature becomes more and more useful as the game progresses.) Wandering about many of the levels are FireStars which will weaken your spacesuit and eventually destroy it. Each level has a time limit in which to solve the maze and retrieve all of the crystals.",

Each door will give a different benefit, and a combination of them is the key to succeed .. or fail. \n \nTo open a door, a puzzle is presented, where pieces of a key have to be rotated and merged together to open the door. The further you run, the more difficult the key puzzles become. \n \nThere are three different modes: \n \n* Normal Mode: Score is increasing the more you survive. It decreases the more you stay idle in a room without picking a door. There\u0027s a set amount of rooms to complete before reaching the end. \n* Endless Mode: Score increases with each room that is completed. There is no end to the amount of rooms presented. \n* Random Mode: Each door has a specific score as a reward when opened. Rooms and their rewards spawn at random. \n \nThe available benefits from the doors are: \n \n* Green doors: Increase running speed. \n* Purple doors: Increase lock-picking skills, which makes opening new doors easier. \n* Blue doors: Gives extra chances before losing. \n* Brown doors provide no direct benefit, apart from helping complete more rooms.",

    "summary": "Day of the Tentacle, also known as Maniac Mansion II: Day of the Tentacle, is a 1993 graphic adventure game developed and published by LucasArts. It is the sequel to the 1987 game Maniac Mansion. The game\u0027s plot follows Bernard Bernoulli and his friends Hoagie and Laverne as they attempt to stop the evil Purple Tentacle — a sentient, disembodied tentacle — from taking over the world. The player takes control of the three and solves puzzles while using time travel to explore different periods of history.\n\nDave Grossman and Tim Schafer co-led the game\u0027s development, their first time in such a role. The pair carried over a limited amount of elements from Maniac Mansion and forwent the character selection aspect to simplify development. Inspirations included Chuck Jones cartoons and the history of the United States. Day of the Tentacle is the eighth LucasArts title to use the SCUMM engine, and the company\u0027s first title to feature voice acting.\n\nThe game was released simultaneously on floppy disk and CD-ROM to critical acclaim and commercial success. Critics focused on its cartoon-style visuals and comedic elements. Day of the Tentacle has featured regularly in lists of \"top\" games published more than two decades after its release, and aspects have been referenced in popular culture.",
