    "summary": "The Ancient Art of War is a computer game developed by Evryware and published by Broderbund in 1984. In retrospect, it is generally recognized as one of the first real-time strategy or real-time tactics games. \n \nA battlefield simulation, the game\u0027s title comes from the classic strategy text The Art of War written by Sun Tzu around 400 B.C. \n \nThe objective of the game is to win a series of battles using four types of troops: Knights, Archers, Barbarians, and Spies. All four types are unmounted. It uses the simple \"Rock-Paper-Scissors\" type of unit balance typical of the genre. Knights beat Barbarians in melee; Barbarians have the advantage over Archers; and Archers have the advantage over Knights, in addition to being effective at defending against attempts to storm a fort. Spies did not fight, but had twice the range of any other unit type in terms of lifting the fog of war. \n \nAt the start of the game, the player is able to select from a list of campaigns to play. The campaigns include both skirmishes and \"capture the flag(s)\" type missions, while the terrain layout and initial starting units provided a variety of strategic options for game play. Advanced rule sets such as Training New Units and Supply Line Lengths allow for more customization. The player can also select from among several Artificial Intelligence opponents represented by various historical figures such as Geronimo and Napoleon. Sun Tzu represents the most difficult level. These settings affected both AI behavior, as well as certain properties such as the speed at which enemy units moved through difficult terrain. \n \nThere is no element of the economic management (mining, gathering or construction) which is a common feature of later real-time strategy games.",

Sub-Zero\u0027s interface is the same as in every MK game, with the addition of a \"use\" and \"turn around\" buttons and additions such as an inventory, and a slight RPG twist in which you get exp. for defeating opponents, which translates into new techniques and moves to execute in the game.",

And to think that it all started only because the two wanted to drink some beer... one event led to another, and in the end the heroes have to face ultimate evil in a scenario that is in many ways a parody on the famed Lord of the Rings. \n \nThe gameplay is similar to that of the previous games in the series, being a traditional puzzle-solving adventure. This time, branching dialogue and logical puzzles have a more prominent place, along with the typical inventory-based tasks. Graphical style has changed, for the first time in the series: the backgrounds are pre-rendered instead of hand-drawn 2D, and character models are now three-dimensional.",

    "summary": "Cold Comfort is an asymmetrical, tactical 5v5 PvP FPS. Set in the immediate aftermath of the zombie apocalypse, it has a strong focus on cooperation and environmental destruction. Play as either a Survivor or a Gamma Prime- each side having completely unique game mechanics and vastly different goals. Each Survivor has their own exclusive weapon sets, skills, and gadgets. Their unified goal: the preservation of humanity from the throes of the Gamma Strain pandemic. They must rescue and evacuate civilians, ensuring that the infection does not spread. \n \nAs with any virus, it\u0027s main prerogative is to evolve and disseminate. The Gamma Primes, victims mutated by the Gamma Strain, are the perfect catalyst for this task. As a Gamma Prime, you start the game embodying an infected rat. Scurrying around, spreading terror and infection. The more corpses and civilians you infect, the greater your respawn pool becomes. Choose when you want to take the next evolutionary step, and become a zombie, and then fully evolve into a Gamma Prime; using these stages to your advantage.",

In order to clear a level, your bridge must be able to withstand successfully the weight of a train running on it. Hopefully, you can try an unlimited number of times...\n\nThe game actually features a very advanced physics model, taking into account compression and stretching - and of course gravity.",

    "summary": "The game stars the brother of Ninja-kun (from Ninja-Kid). Princess Sakura has been kidnapped by Damazu-Dayuu, and because Ninja-Kun is away on a journey, the task falls to young JaJaMaru-kun.\n\nIn the game, the player starts with three lives and can only run, jump and throw shurikens. The game is divided into stages, each with four floors and eight enemies. Sakura-Hime and Damazu are placed, unreachable, at the top of the screen. Enemies use various projectiles, one of which will cause the player to lose a life. If JaJaMaru-kun lands on top of an enemy, it will simply be temporarily stunned and vice versa. Once an enemy is defeated and offscreen, a spirit will appear and ascend to the top of the screen. It can be collected before it has disappeared to receive points, which vary depending on the enemy. Sakura will sometimes drop petals that the player can collect, and Damazu will sometimes run around, dropping bombs. To advance to the next stage, the player must defeat all eight enemies by using shurikens.\n\nSome bricks yield items. They include:\n\nA cart that temporarily makes JaJaMaru-kun invincible and faster. Projectiles and enemies will also be destroyed if touched.\nA bottled substance that makes JaJaMaru temporarily invincible and able to walk through enemies.\nA red ball that increases speed.\nBombs (which must be avoided).\nCoins that yield various amounts of points.\nAn extra life.\n\nIf all three types of power-ups are collected, Gamapa-kun, a giant frog, will be summoned, which is completely invincible and able to eat all enemies. If three of Sakura\u0027s petals are collected, the player will go to a bonus stage in which JaJaMaru-kun is on the bottom and Damazu at the top. Damazu drops bombs, and the player throws shurikens upward. If the player manages to hit Damazu, bonus points are awarded. If the JaJaMaru-kun is hit by a bomb, he goes on to the next stage.",

While other PlayStation 2 football titles are happy to concentrate on national and international teams, here the beautiful game is taken right down to grass roots, allowing you (if you wish) to seize control of a local team.\n\nYou do that as part of the best feature in the game: the career mode. Here, you really can go from the very bottom to the very top, and it adds a challenging long term goal to the proceedings. It\u0027s just one example of where the game differs from the opposition, and there are plenty more. For instance, you can also try and blatantly blag a penalty by diving in the area. You can get penalised for handball. You can even take it online and test your skills. In short, there\u0027s plenty going on.",

    "summary": "LONG AGO, THE GREAT TREE ATLAS GREW AT THE CENTER OF A DISTANT GALAXY. \n \nThe worlds touched by Atlas prospered, and countless life forms thrived under its power. \n \nBut even galaxies have to die. \n \nWhen the black hole at the galaxy’s heart began to grow, swallowing nearby stars, Atlas sacrificed itself, spawning thousands of seeds, each containing the essence of all life in the galaxy. The seeds were flung outward, toward the edge of the galaxy, beyond where Atlas’s power had ever reached. The seeds drifted for endless centuries. One by one, they were lost in the vast darkness between the stars. Only a single seed survived. Weakened and dying, Atlas’s instincts drove it toward the nearest suitable planet. This was Arctora, and it was not like anything the seed could have imagined. \n \nArctora was a world of metal and silver seas. Vast swathes of its surface had been sheared of all organic material, all an effort by a powerful artificial intelligence known as the Librarian to convert the planet into a single computer. Organic life had long become almost extinct, replaced by cybernetic servants to the Librarian. When Atlas’s seed landed and released its power, Arctora was changed forever. \n \nAtlas’s seed landed and its power surged through the land. With so little organic matter to work with, the power used what it had. Millions of new life forms, some organic, some cybernetic — but most of them a combination of both — were born instantly. Four essences, or Guardians, greater than the others, emerged from the seed. Calling themselves Gorok, Ometa, Apophis, and Hamaliel, they were created for the single purpose of guarding Atlas’s seed until it could regrow. Heroes, each sworn to one of the four guardians, flocked to the continent. There were no rules, no boundaries, no laws. The new land was full of dangers and demanded alliances - but alliances on Arctora are ephemeral things. Each Guardian was determined to be the one to find the energy source and regrow Atlas… and to take its power for itself.",

    "summary": "WildSnake is a puzzle game in which the player must manage falling snakes in a confined space and keep the snakes from reaching the top of the space. Snakes fall and slither until they reach a resting spot on the floor of the space. A snake will destroy any other snakes of the same color and pattern that it touches with its head on the way down, which often has the chain effect of loosening the pile of snakes so that all the snakes slither into new positions, possibly eliminating even more snakes. \n \nThe game is played against a selection of backgrounds including desert, forest, water, or grass. Further, there are 7 game grids including the standard grid (a tall rectangle), X, plus, flask, Diabolo (an hourglass pattern), T-square, and obstacle (with a number of intermediate blocks). \n \nThe player starts out as a nestling and earns higher and higher distinctions taken from the snake realm (garter snake, water snake, boa, mambo, python, king cobra, etc.) as more snakes are cleared. Also, as the level increases. more types of snake patterns must be handled. Sometimes, there is a flashing red snake that eliminates the first snake it touches. Further, there is occasionally an unstoppable snake that barrels down to the bottom of the space, eliminating all snakes in its path. \n \nThe game can be played with 1 or 2 players in either easy, normal or hard mode. In the single player mode, the player can choose whether the preview showing the next snake will be shown. In 2-player mode, there is always a preview window. In fact, there is a queue of 3 snakes between the 2 player spaces from which the next snake is drawn. As a bonus during competition, multiple snake eliminations by one player result in obstacles appearing in the space of the opposing player.",

Like most titles Infocom produced, the use of ZIL made it possible to release the game simultaneously for many popular computer platforms, including the Apple II, IBM PC, Atari ST, and Commodore 64. Sherlock is based on the legendary fictional detective Sherlock Holmes, created by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. It is Infocom\u0027s thirty-first game and is the first of two Infocom games developed by Challenge, Inc. using Infocom\u0027s development tools. \n \nThe year is 1887, and all of England is gearing up for the celebration of Queen Victoria\u0027s Golden Jubilee, marking her 50th year as monarch. London, naturally, is especially frenzied. Reading the paper one morning, Sherlock Holmes seizes upon one seemingly unimportant notice: the Tower of London has been closed for \"reasons of security.\" The great detective is unsurprised when, moments later, he is asked to investigate the theft of the Crown Jewels. The clues left behind, however, positively reek of a carefully laid trap; Sherlock decides that he must step aside and allow Dr. Watson to pursue the thief instead. But if the Jewels are not replaced within 48 hours, the British government will be forced to admit that their most prized possessions were stolen and suffer worldwide humiliation. \n \nThe player fills the role of Watson, travelling around London in Hansom cabs while attempting to recover the Crown Jewels while encountering many characters from Doyle\u0027s stories such as Mrs. Hudson, Mycroft Holmes, and Wiggins of the Baker Street Irregulars.",

    "summary": "Immerse yourself in the dangerous world of America’s Wild West – as you encounter famous historical events of the late 1800’s and come up against some of the amazing inventions of this period. \n \nBounty Train aims to bring back the “good old days” of steam railways, bandit attacks and cross-country rail journeys to life in a survival-railroad simulation unlike any other. \n \nAs young Walter, the son of a railroad tycoon, you start off with everything good in life, and have it quickly stripped away. That means it’s up to you to preserve the family’s legacy as rail tycoon, working to connect both coasts of America via a trans-continental railroad. But, it’s never as simple as it sounds, and you’ll face plenty of competition, from other rail barons to local bandits, angry Native tribes and much more. \n \nIn Bounty Train, you’ll learn all about managing a train – from buying the best steam engines you can afford, to keeping them fueled and in good repair as you race from town to town, delivering cargo and completing tasks for your “clients.” And don’t forget, there’s always someone looking to steal your cargo or even your train, so you’ll want to hire a hardy crew of gunslingers.",

The Microsoft Xbox 360 Wireless Racing Wheel was developed in alongside Forza Motorsport 2 and is designed to work with the game. \n \nMost cars in Forza 2 can be visually customized with both aerodynamic parts as well as graphics. 1,000 layers of graphics can be created with the livery editor to draw shapes, letters and pictures onto a car.[1] According to the developer, it is preventing possible copyright conflicts, also reducing loads in online races. Paint schemes can be auctioned online to other players for in-game credits. Many players reproduced paint schemes appeared in real world, or creating Itashas through this system. \n \nThe game supports split-screen, System Link and Xbox Live multiplayer gaming. Split-screen allows two player head-to-head racing, while both System Link and Xbox Live allow up to eight players to participate in a single race. Using Xbox Live \u0027Silver\u0027, players can also buy in-game cars through the game\u0027s Auction House. A \u0027Gold\u0027 account is needed to sell and \u0027gift\u0027 cars. \n \nForza Motorsport 2 concentrates on circuit racing; point to point races which were featured in the original Forza Motorsport have been removed.[2] Real world tracks Road Atlanta, Silverstone, Laguna Seca, Tsukuba, Mugello Circuit, Sebring International Raceway, Suzuka Circuit, and Nürburgring Nordschleife are licensed and included. Forza 2 is also one of the first racing games to prominently feature cars from the American Le Mans Series in both the game and downloadable content. \n \nThe damage and physics in the game have been revamped over the previous game, allowing for multiple settings: \"simulation,\" which is the most severe, allowing for damage that can take a car out of commission; \"limited,\" which scales down the severity of impact of crashes; and \"cosmetic,\" where the damage is merely visual.[3] The damage ratings for each part of the vehicle can be seen on the HUD (heads up display) accessed from the in-game menu. \n \nProfessional racers playtested the wheel to aid the development in trying to achieve realistic features and settings.[4] Forza Motorsport 2 features force feedback with the use of the Xbox 360 Wireless Racing Wheel. \n \nForza 2 runs at 60 frames per second in 720p resolution (HD), with replays running at 30 frames per second to accommodate additional after-effects.",
