The game’s art direction reflects this, but Sonic 2 HD has also given equal attention to unseen essential elements in the physics and audio. The result of this is an unprecedented re-interpretation in high definition graphics, music and gameplay of Sonic 2, which continues to set quality standards to this day.\n\n2D artwork is the foundation of Sonic’s retro roots. With this in mind, the goal was to produce a similar shading style to the Japanese original concept artwork and set it in motion with hand-drawn animations. Now, 25 years after Sonic 2’s release, Sonic 2 HD can faithfully represent the original’s cast of characters and environments in a world where technology no longer imposes artistic limitations.","tags":[1,35,268435464,268435487,536872059,536872916,536873377,536874296,536892635,536892669,536895036,536895709,536895731,536899555,536899602,536900335],"videos":[{"id":49506,"video_id":"J6haHRbbD1M"},{"id":49507,"video_id":"RmpIkrl-B5M"}]},{"id":61026,"cover":{"id":161194,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co3gdm.jpg"},"name":"Naruto Shippuden: Dairansen!

The player chooses his mission and from among 6 different helicopters, whose speed and armor vary. Each mission begins by a briefing from HQ. Once in flight, the action begins, where the player can fire forward in front of them at enemy opponents and installations.

Far off in the Horsehead Nebula, a group of shapeshifting aliens known as World Watchers assign planets for their Watchers to protect. A purple alien, Widget, is an apprentice assigned with the job of protecting Earth. Along for the ride is his intelligent sidekick, Mega Brain.\n\nSuper Widget is a platform game for the Super Nintendo, based on the cartoon show, Widget. It shares some similarities to the game Felix the Cat in how the main character upgrades their weapon as they collect more power-ups.\n\nWidget navigates through various worlds as he travels to Earth, picking up 'W' coins - 100 earns him an extra life. There are also special power ups in different categories - these allow Widget to transform into a variety of different creatures, each with their own different ranged attack. As the player collects more power-ups of the same type (up to three), they change into more powerful creatures. If the player gets hit while transformed, they change back to the previous creature. If they get hit while as normal Widget, they lose a life.\n\nAt the end of each world is a boss character. These are larger enemies that require learning their basic pattern, avoiding their attacks, and then firing back with your own. After defeating the boss, the player is graded based on how long it took to complete the level and their combat skills. They are then awarded 'Watcher Experience' based on these grades.","tags":[1,18,268435464,536870915,536871882,536872475,536872961,536875053,536875074,536875292,536875396,536876585,536876713,536879201]},{"id":184630,"cover":{"id":222757,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co4rvp.jpg"},"name":"Picowars","platforms":[{"id":6,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}],"screenshots":[{"id":798019,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sch3r7.jpg"}],"summary":"A retro fan-game and unofficial prequel to Nintendo's Advance Wars series made in the PICO-8 fantasy console.","tags":[39,268435471,268435480]},{"id":49555,"name":"Combat Choro Q: Advance Daisakusen","platforms":[{"id":24,"name":"Game Boy Advance"}],"summary":"Combat Choro Q: Advance Daisakusen is a Strategy game, developed by Access and published by Takara, which was released in Japan in 2002.","tags":[268435471]},{"id":144823,"cover":{"id":134220,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co2vkc.jpg"},"name":"Desecrators","platforms":[{"id":6,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}],"screenshots":[{"id":427119,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc95kf.jpg"},{"id":427120,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc95kg.jpg"},{"id":427121,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc95kh.jpg"},{"id":427122,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc95ki.jpg"},{"id":427123,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc95kj.jpg"}],"summary":"Desecrators is a 6 degrees of freedom shooter where you must loot derelict space structures.

The Ninja Boys are treated as a single entity and so these statistics are shared between Jack and Ryu with equal values. Battles with the enemy, either through random encounters or visible on the map is where the action starts. The characters enter a side-scrolling 'battle mode' where they may jump, fight, use their special techniques, items and spells, as well as activate various bonuses on the battlefield by breaking open the bonus boxes. A battle is over and experience points awarded when a pre-determined number of enemies are defeated or the Ninja Boys are defeated.\n\nWhen bosses are encountered, the gameplay changes to a turn-based system. Each turn, commands are given to Jack and Ryu, which include usage of special items and skills acquired during the game, who then perform actions based on those commands.

It was released in the arcades by Konami on October 30, 1999. Although only officially released in Japan, units exist worldwide. It has a total of 68 songs, 35 of which were new to Dance Dance Revolution. \n \nThe core gameplay of 3rdMix is the same as the previous Dance Dance Revolution games. 3rdMix featured a brand new scoring system, instead of being heavily combo-based like the last two mixes, combos are of virtually no importance. The maximum score for each song is 10,000,000 (all Perfects). Perfects are worth twice as many points as Greats, and steps toward the end are worth progressively higher points than steps toward the beginning. In nonstop mode, a 2x, 3x and 4x multiplier apply to the 2nd, 3rd and 4th songs respectively, making a perfect nonstop worth 100,000,000 points. \n \n3rdMix was also the first version of DDR where different beats (compared to a 4-beat register) alternate different colors, making 1/4, 1/8, 1/12 and 1/16 steps look different and making it easier for the player to recognize changing rhythms. This color scheme is called \"vivid\" mode, whereby the old scheme of all arrows being the same color is henceforth referred to as \"flat\" mode. Flat appears as an option and modifier in later versions of DDR. \n \nThis release marked the first time lyrics were displayed during gameplay for every song. This can be turned on or off by the arcade operator. This feature was later dropped from future arcade mixes, although some home versions contain this as an option, and most European Dancing Stage versions contain this on by default. \n \n3rdMix also allowed to choose characters, and while their purpose is for the most part aesthetical, the chosen character affects which beatmania remix song can be played at one playthorugh.","tags":[40,268435463,268435465,268435489,536871783,536871877,536872611,536883765,536888787,536895137],"videos":[{"id":37782,"video_id":"6E1DiSPGEoA"}]},{"id":20571,"aggregated_rating":70.0,"cover":{"id":123773,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co2ni5.jpg"},"name":"Fighting Fantasy: The Talisman of Death","platforms":[{"id":38,"name":"PlayStation Portable"}],"screenshots":[{"id":27929,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/bmwipktzmzjnis982rkw.jpg"},{"id":27930,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/lhrvtgvsxb1za2kirdn7.jpg"},{"id":27931,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/kr1gzximv6ybt9t2rtyj.jpg"}],"summary":"This PSN-exclusive version of Fighting Fantasy: Talisman of Death features a Tarot Card character generation system, and the classic dice-rolling rule set you know and love, with optional all-new Battle and Test Your Luck systems for bold adventurers to explore.","tags":[17,536871158],"videos":[{"id":8983,"video_id":"OEzqSbbvE9s"}]},{"id":49557,"name":"Cinnamoroll FuwaFuwa Daibouken","platforms":[{"id":24,"name":"Game Boy Advance"}],"summary":"Cinnamoroll FuwaFuwa Daibouken is a Simulation game, developed and published by Rocket Company, which was released in Japan in 2005.","tags":[33]},{"id":147894,"cover":{"id":212029,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co4jlp.jpg"},"name":"PixelMaker Studio","platforms":[{"id":37,"name":"Nintendo 3DS"}],"screenshots":[{"id":449593,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc9mwp.jpg"},{"id":449595,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc9mwr.jpg"},{"id":449597,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc9mwt.jpg"},{"id":449599,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc9mwv.jpg"},{"id":449600,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc9mww.jpg"}],"summary":"PixelMaker Studio is a drawing program designed specifically for making pixel art images, animations and tile-based scenes!

It continues to stand out among other action RPGs for its seamless gameplay that anyone from beginner to veteran can enjoy.\n\nOne of the most memorable elements of the Mana series is the Ring Command menu system. With the single press of a button, a ring-shaped menu appears on the screen, where players can use items, change weapons, and do a variety of other actions without needing to switch screens. This Ring Command menu system for which the Mana series is so well known was first introduced in Secret of Mana and has since appeared in most games in the series.\n\nPlay as Randi and his two companions, Primm and Popoi, as they adventure all around the world. At the center of our epic story is the mystical power of Mana. Battle the empire in its quest for control of Mana. Befriend the eight elementals who wield the forces of nature itself.

The missile launchers have a finite number of missiles and can be destroyed by missiles. You earn points for shooting down missiles, nukes and airplanes, and for each city that survives each round, which can earn bonus cities which replace destroyed cities.\n\nWhen you have no cities left, the game is over. Version 2.0 added sound card support; a large number of configurable options; a display of how many missiles each launcher has remaining; branching missiles (MIRVs), and \"blossoming\" explosions, in which the destroyed missiles blow up and can destroy the other missiles, causing a chain reaction of destructions.

At the end of the corrido, Juan picks Maria Blanca as his preferred wife, while the other two women became the wives of Juan's brothers, Pedro and Diego. All three women had interesting backgrounds, but the way they were treated in the story left something to be desired. This is a manuscript that is often discussed in Filipino literature classes, but the portrayal of women — either as damsels in distress or prizes to be chosen — are not empowering. \n \nAdarna: The Legend of Maria Blanca re-imagines what it would be like if these princesses' lives did not revolve around Juan or his brothers. Many regions of pre-Hispanic Philippines had matriarchal societies, and while the first Adarna game released by Senshi.Labs had a very Western feel to it, this sequel attempts to transport the players back to an indigeous pre-colonial atmosphere while keeping the language somewhat up to date. \n \nThis adventure starts off in the Kingdom of Reinos de los Kristales, where the Princess Maria Blanca learns that her sister Isabela has fallen ill. A hermit approaches Maria to inform her that Isabela can only be cured by the mythical creature of Adarna. Maria then slips away from the kingdom and embarks on a quest to find the legendary bird.","tags":[268435468,536871208,536871632]},{"id":149362,"cover":{"id":142691,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co323n.jpg"},"name":"The Thief Girl","platforms":[{"id":6,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}],"screenshots":[{"id":466923,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sca0a3.jpg"},{"id":466926,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sca0a6.jpg"},{"id":466931,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sca0ab.jpg"},{"id":466936,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sca0ag.jpg"},{"id":466937,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sca0ah.jpg"},{"id":466940,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sca0ak.jpg"},{"id":466944,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sca0ao.jpg"},{"id":466945,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sca0ap.jpg"}],"summary":"The Thief Girl is a stealth mission game in which you control a thief girl to collect treasure and get to the goal.

With approximately 30-40 minutes of gameplay comprising each episode, the structure of Alone in the Dark pulls you into world that delivers a fiercely gripping and terrifying experience. Each time the player launches a saved game, the episode will begin with a video summary of the previous episode to quickly re-immerse the player in the story and removing the need to remember where they were or what they were doing. Every episode will close with a nail-biting cliff-hanger ending to rattle players' nerves, and if the player is leaving the game a video teaser of the next episode will play to leave them wanting more.\n\nAlone in the Dark will provide a complete next-generation, action packed experience within a highly detailed, free roaming environment, featuring a mixture of real-time physics and full environmental interaction.
