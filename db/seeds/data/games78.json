The introduction shows the titular hero taking a crap on a platform. First one only sees his strained face and has to wonder what physical challenge he has to endure, but then the camera zooms out to reveal everything. \n \nPlayers who haven\u0027t already been chased away by this gross display get \"treated\" to a decidedly mediocre 1-on-1 fighting game. The controls work a tiny bit better than in most other examples of the genre on the PC, but there\u0027s not much meaning to the fighting overall. The game works on a weird experience system, which encourages to use the same move over and over again and destroys any balancing the game might have had in the first place.",

To succeed the player must press the pads with their feet and hands at the same time as the on screen aerobics instructor. Any missed movements are recorded on a mistake counter and 10 missed movements will fail the level. The routines (a set of repeated movements) start slow and simple with a bit of no-penalty practise time however as the player gets better the routines get more complex with less practices time. Each level has a set number of routines that increase with each level from 4 at the start to a total of 32 on the final level (level 7). At the successful completion of each level the player will get a pass stamp which they can enter later to skip that level.",

Solving a level invariably involves collecting microchips with available tools such as keys, magnets, shields, and cleats. Doors, traps, monsters, and other mischievous devices pose barriers, entice you into danger and complicate your progress. As each level is solved you are led into the next, slightly more difficult level.\n\nThe first eight levels are puzzles that introduce you to the game\u0027s basic concepts. You find your way through mazes, collect keys to open doors, teleport from place to place, pick-up tools, and use logic to conquer each puzzle.\n\nThe levels get progressively more formidable. You must pay attention to subtle hidden clues, learn how to evade many forms of disaster, and execute a complex series of actions.\n\nWith 144 levels, even the most skilled strategy game players will be absorbed by Chip\u0027s Challenge for countless hours.",

You’re filled with God’s will to purify the world from its depravity. You are the hand of God and there will be no mercy for sinners! \n \nThe main and most unique gameplay mechanics in God’s Trigger is called Divine Focus and gives the player the ability to avoid bullets and tactically plan his attacks. The time is running normally for as long as the player keeps moving. As soon as Zoran stops though, the time slows down too. This allows the player to actually see bullets coming his way and in result avoid them. Even though the player can activate and deactivate Divine Focus whenever he wants, the ability has its limits. To refill its resource, the player needs to kill at least one enemy, without Divine Focus being activated. \n \nAnother feature important for how the gameplay evolves is a One Mistake rule which is really simple in its assumptions. Each hit is fatal for the main protagonist and means the game is over for the player. \n \nThe main reason behind introducing those two mechanics to the game, was to give players the opportunity to experience the joy of a pure, hardcore gameplay, with no place for mistakes. But in the same time, to give them a lot of freedom in clearing up the level and deciding how their play through will look like.\"",

    "summary": "Time Crisis is a light gun shooter arcade game released by Namco in 1996. It was later ported for the PlayStation in 1997, bundled with the Guncon light gun controller.\n\n\nGAMEPLAY:\nTime Crisis is a three-dimensional first person rail shooter similar to Virtua Cop and The House of the Dead installments, in which the player holds a light gun and goes through the motions of firing at on-screen enemies. Time Crisis is best known for its cover system, in which players can duck behind cover to avoid enemy fire and reload his weapon. There are three stages, each consisting of three areas and a boss battle. Unique features are described here in:\n\nA foot pedal which performs multiple functions: when the pedal is released, the player takes cover to conserve hit points while reloading the gun. While the pedal is released, the player cannot attack. In console conversions, a button command replicates the foot pedal\u0027s functions. The player loses a life if he/she is hit by a direct bullet or obstacle whilst not taking cover, with the game ending if he/she loses all lives.\nA light gun (introduced in Point Blank) which utilized a special memory chip to synchronize areas of the screen\u0027s image as the player rotates the gun around. The light gun also features a blowback function which simulates real-life gun recoil.\nA countdown timer, recharged by clearing an area of enemies. As running down the clock causes an instant game over, the player must take risks, shooting enemies rapidly and hiding only when necessary. A time extension is rewarded when an area is passed and there are also time bonuses awarded for shooting certain enemies quickly.\nThe PlayStation port features an exclusive side-story mode, in which the player\u0027s performance, such as how quickly he can clear an area, affects the path he takes through the game, resulting in multiple possibilities.",

Almost all of the maps could be played in deathmatch or cooperative mode.\n\nA DeHackEd patch is used to change the levels\u0027 names and par times. This WAD is widely known not only by the means of detail and texture alignment or frequent use of non-standard graphics, but also by enhancing gameplay on some of the levels, most notably on the super secret level, which contains 32 secrets that should be accessed one by one using various techniques including rocket jumping, waiting for a monster to open a locked door from behind or just by careful observation of the level\u0027s objects."

These ships are small, fast and agile, and extremely dangerous due to the on-board torpedo launchers. But they are also the most vulnerable of all military vessels. More than once in the history of WWII, a handful of those little deadly boats helped decide the course of an entire battle and executed seemingly impossible missions.  \n  \nThey were called the \"mosquito fleet\" because of their unique combat tactics. Using speed and agility, dodging enemy fire, PT boats approached seemingly giant enemy ships in a fight of David against Goliath, stung them with well aimed torpedo volleys - and immediately withdrew!  \n  \nThe casualties were immense, but the results often worth these lives and sacrifices. These small heroes of the great war made an unforgettable contribution to the Allied victory.",

This is the life of a warrior, and victory is yours for the taking. \n \nFollowing a cataclysmic world war at the dawn of the 20th century, the most powerful Empires left standing came together to ban gun powder under The Black Powder Treaty. The short peace that followed gave birth to the Pansophic Revolution – a golden age of industrial manufacturing and design. As technology advanced, old tensions reignited and soon the world faced the scourge of war once more. Fueled by technological Pansophic advancements, the face of warfare has changed. All disagreements are settled head-on by elite teams of chosen warriors from all over the world, with each member specializing in either high-tech ranged gadgetry or sophisticated melee weapons. Trained and bred for battle, they meet each other in sanctioned WarZones to face off for their share of glory.",

Go South into Portbury docks and take in the magnificent Clifton Suspension Bridge or take a heavy freight load past Filton Airport, where Concorde G-BOAF resides opposite the magnificent Brabazon hangars. \n \nDo you feel like taking a trip back to the past? Drive to the Bristol Harbour Railway where you can travel up and down the dockside railway and see Brunel\u0027s famous SS Great Britain and the M Shed Museum which occupies the former Bristol Industrial Museum building. \n \nOr maybe you\u0027d prefer a trip into the future? Portishead railway station is subject to a great deal of debate at the moment with ongoing campaigns to re-open the line and its stations at Pill and Portishead to ease traffic on the A369. The line has been included, with the station at Pill bought back to life and the lines laid and station buildings placed at Portishead station. \n \nIf you want to do some good old fashioned shunting, there\u0027s plenty of scope for that too, with the docks at Avonmouth and Portbury, coaling yards at Avonmouth, and shunting yards at Stoke Gifford and east of Bristol Temple Meads. \n \nBristol and Avonmouth includes a total of 21 stations and features 15 scenarios, ten using default stock, and five using stock from Just Trains, as well as four Free Roams.",

Each weapon has 5 power levels that are activate during kill streaks, increasing your power making you a force to be feared. Be careful though: weapon power levels are lost upon death, so with great power comes great risk. \n\nBlueprint Crafting System: Gather materials from fallen foes and defeated objectives to craft and upgrade armor sets over the course of a match. Each set of armor has different benefits and weaknesses that can emphasize your favorite playstyle or counter what your enemies are trying to do.\n\nTitan Mode: Battle in epic matches centered on the your team\u0027s Titan, a giant, destructive robot that confronts the enemy\u0027s Titan. Players can power up their Titan by performing tasks in-game, can defend their mammoth ally by killing enemy players, and can attack enemy Titans directly. The teams compete until one side\u0027s Titan reaches the enemy base and destroys it!\n\n5v5 Competitive Gameplay: Create cunning strategies with your teammates and define your unique role on the team by combining different weapons, armor and devices. Support your teammates weapons that increase drop rates for materials and powerups, defend your Titan with armor that grants additional health and survivability, scout enemy positions with weapon and armor that increase speed and allow for double or triple jumps, or simply go glass cannon and dish out as much damage as you can.",

    "summary": "SKAZA - online multiplayer social strategy game from the found chronicle ... Since ancient times, fabulous creatures goblin, kikimors, swamp spirits and many others have always helped ordinary wanderers and heroes. They gave them gifts in every possible way and supported them in their development. And there was an idyll between people and creatures, everyone lived in peace and harmony. But over time, more and more people began to be attracted and interested in the wealth of fairy-tale heroes. Because of human greed and cruelty, the first disagreements arose. People began to enslave creatures with impunity. Greed and lust for profit overshadowed their minds. And then Perun decided to protect the creatures from people and endowed them with incredible strength and abilities to protect humans from the misfortune. He split the old world and created several new ones, scattered riches over unknown distances, which the creatures reliably guarded. \n \nThe strategic component of the game is determined by two main conditions: \n1. There are two types of interaction between players in the game. Either the player becomes a prince and develops by capturing and surrounding locations belonging to other players, or he becomes a fiefdom and at these locations is mining items and materials. In fact, this is a symbiosis, some players are engaged in mining, others protect them by receiving profit from them, while they jointly expand their possessions by spreading their influence to other principalities and cities. The mechanics of capturing and surrounding locations is a separate game, reminiscent of a game of \"dots\" on a large spherical world with a size of 25,000 hexagons. \n \n \n2. Players, through close social interaction, identify leaders who are appointed to govern cities and states as a whole. Such players, while occupying positions, have mechanisms at their disposal to manage the economy of the game. They also develop a strategy for the development of the state as a whole, dictating foreign and domestic policies and the conditions for the existence of the players themselves in it. Such appointments occur weekly, so the dynamics of development in the game depends entirely on the correctness of the actions of the gaming community, as well as on the insight and wisdom of the rulers. \n \nIn the game, the strategy is the main point, however, in addition to this, all the basic familiar mechanics are implemented, grind for grinders, battle for battles, sandbox for sandstone, casual for casual, craft for crafters, etc., but made with a new look at making games. Everything here is comfortably balanced and everyone will find for themselves what they need.",

Without the ability to recover energy or upgrade your weapons, players must take survival into their own hands, exploring the planet of Machia and unlocking the secrets it has to offer. \n \nThe creatures inhabiting Machia are giant beasts appropriately named \u0027Gigantes.\u0027 In order to take these massive brutes down, you\u0027ll need to find and hit their weak spots together with your allies. \n \nSega also implemented tweaks based off the Phantasy Star Nova battle demo into the game. After the first demo, tri-Ace increased character movement speed by 1.4x, reduced input delay, fixed issues with locking on to enemies, and fine tuned the speed of the camera, among other improvements.",

    "summary": "Application software experts PC Globe Inc. made an advance into the gaming sector in the early 90’s within their field of expertise: geography. With a back catalog of several installments of the then-leading world atlas and almanac software, PC Globe, the company turned snippets of country-specific info into an educational game that mixed two-player “Identify that place” strategy with a “Get to know the globe” learning effect – can you say Carmen Sandiego? \n \nAs the sinister Otto von Slinkenrat tries to pocket the world’s treasures in his private collection, renowned adventurer Bush Buck sets out to find and secure the valuable objects for posterity. In a race around the globe, you and an opponent travel back and forth between 206 cities in 175 countries in search for clues to the treasures’ whereabouts. Cities are connected by a network of plane routes; players take turns in jetting from one destination to the next. On each visit to a city, you learn some background info – e.g. about landmarks, geography, culture. \n \nLearning to place countries and cities on the globe is essential to finding the treasures, which are all linked to a specific place on Earth. If you know that a Samisen is a Japanese musical instrument, for example, you can make your way directly to Tokyo; if not, a set of clues that you collect on your travels will point out features of the target country and town which help narrow down your options – e.g. “It’s an island country”, “It’s in East Asia” etc. The first player to visit the target town collects the treasure and has to return it to his home base for a points reward. \n \nFor each game, the computer selects 15 out of 400 possible objects; if all are found or if both players run out of plane tickets (each flight costs one ticket), the game ends and whoever has amassed the most points wins. Three difficulty levels increase the AI strength and reduce helpful hints, making Bush Buck a challenge even for experienced globe trotters.",

While the graphics, music, and gameplay all remain true to the classic 16-bit Super Famicom release, this version marks the first time the 1994 game will be localized for the West. A new opening cinematic, new manga cutscenes, and new theme song by River City Girls composer Megan McDuffee have been added as well. Set out solo or team up with a friend in local co-op and discover how the River City Girls story began!",

Trials of Obi-Wan includes more than 50 new quests, from rescue missions to the exploration of a crashed Republic cruiser. Many quests also revolve around the return of HK-47 from Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic, whom players can kill for a quest. \n \nThe expansion also allows players to interact with the ghost of Obi-Wan Kenobi to help him \"correct an imbalance in the Force\" present on Mustafar. High-level quest rewards include the ability to find a fiery red crystal found only on the volcanic planet that creates a lava-like lightsaber.",

Impossible Mission was the first game to use real synthesized speech, an incredible development when first unleashed on the 8-bit formats. The original game included a random game-map system which ensured that no two games were the same. Although the original still stands the test of time today, inclusion of brand new graphics and sound ensures that Impossible Mission is primed to thrill a brand new audience.\n\nThe gamer takes the role of a secret agent attempting to stop evil genius Professor Elvin Atombender who has been tampering with National Security Computers. Players must penetrate Atombender\u0027s base, attempting to recover parts of the system password whilst avoiding deadly robots in a race against time.\n\nWhilst the game has been re-written from the ground up and features new graphics, 3D objects, new Sound Effects and Music, the gameplay remains impressively loyal with the game layout changing for every new game. There are now three main characters to choose from plus a brand new tutorial mode. The player can now chose from three game modes, new, original and for the purist; a hybrid mode with the original gameplay using the updated graphics.\n\nThe PSP versions offer an unusual feature which allows players to send a full copy of their game to a friend by Wireless so they can try it for themselves."
