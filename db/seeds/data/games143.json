With Althena gone and no one able or willing to become the next Dragonmaster, a shadowy figure, known only as the Magic Emperor, has started plotting to usurp Althena\u0027s place and become a god. In a remote village far removed from the decay that is slowly spreading throughout the world lives a young man named Alex, who dreams of one day becoming the next Dragonmaster like his hero Dyne. One day, Alex\u0027s friend Ramus convinces him to head towards a cave near town, where it is rumored the legendary White Dragon resides. With Alex\u0027s adopted sister Luna and his mysterious pet Nall in tow, Alex heads off on what seems to be a meaningless adventure, not knowing that it would be the first step in an epic journey with the fate of the entire world at stake.",

    "summary": "Cosmology of Kyoto is a visual novel adventure game developed by Softedge and published by Yano Electric. It was released for Japan in 1993, and then in North America, for the Macintosh in 1994 and then for the PC in 1995.\n\nIt is a game where the player, from a first-person perspective, explores ancient Kyoto city during 10th-11th century Japan. The game lacks a clear goal, but is instead nonlinear and emphasizes open exploration, giving players the freedom to explore the city and discover many pathways, buildings, situations, stories and secrets. The game deals with historical, horror, religious and educational themes, and features karma and reincarnation gameplay mechanics. Released on CD-ROM, the dialogues in the game are fully voiced in Japanese, with English subtitles in the localized North American version. The game was not a commercial success, but was critically acclaimed and attracted a cult following.\n\nThe game is set in the medieval city of Kyoto around the year 1000, during the Heian period of Japanese history. The game lacks an overall plot, but it instead presents fragmented narratives in a non-linear manner, as the player character encounters various non-player characters while wandering the city. These narratives are cross-referenced to an encyclopedia, providing background information as the narratives progress and as the player comes across various characters and locations, with various stories and related information appearing at distinct locations.[9]\n\nMany of the characters in the game are based on real-life characters from the city and their appearances in the game are often loosely based on tales from the Konjaku Monogatarishū. The game deals with religion and philosophy, particularly Buddhism and Buddhist philosophy, as well as myth and legend.",

    "summary": "The NES version of Double Dragon takes a wide range of liberties with the interpretation. The entire graphical style is more in line with Technōs’ Kunio-kun series, with characters that go for exaggerated expression rather than gritty realism.\n\nThe biggest change, however, was reserved for the moveset. You start the game with only the punch, kick and headbutt available – all the other moves are obtained via an RPG-lite style experience system. Hitting enemies is now rewarded with a certain amount of experience points depending on the attack, and each time the counter goes above 999, you’re awarded an additional heart, which extends the range of possible actions. Two hearts add the uppercut and roundhouse kick combo finishers, and with three Billy can perform the jump kick maneuver. The fourth heart unlocks access to grappling moves.\n\nThe Game Boy rendition of Double Dragon plays like somewhat of a mix between the arcade and NES versions, although it’s closer to the latter. The controls are all NES, but the RPG elements were dropped and Billy got all his moves ready from the start. The ground attack is gone, but so is the head butt, making for a rather slim arsenal of maneuvers. The game is mostly based on the NES version except for Abobo, who looks even more deformed and has learned Burnov’s grapple from Double Dragon II. The second stage has become even more elaborate, and later parts include some of the new traps from the NES Double Dragon II like the floor that starts giving away.",

Players will relive the events of ‘Operation Market Garden’ across the fields and towns of Holland. \n \n‘The Bloody Seventh’ is our name for the initial focus of the project as we feel it succinctly details the struggle that the British paratroopers had to endure while waiting for their army counterpart to establish a link through the Lower Rhine. \n \nIn a 50 vs. 50 multiplayer setting, players will be given the option to fight with the British Airborne Division and its Polish brigade, British XXX Corps or several branches of the German Army, such as the Wehrmacht or the Waffen SS. It’s a rare opportunity to experience the intense battlefield that was the Battle of Arnhem, which stretched across farms, woods, villages and city areas. Each area is being accurately recreated from archival references that range from street level to aerial images. Whether you’re jumping out of a plane, resupplying friendlies or operating a tank you will find multiple reasons to drop back into the battlefield in this grand scaled representation of a WW2 setting never explored in a large multiplayer environment. \n \nFEATURES \n \nInspired by game such as “Red Orchestra ostfront 41-45” , “Battleground Europe: WWII Online” or “ArmA” we want to provide the perfect mix of realism on large scale maps. \n \nTeamwork oriented gameplay that doesn’t require a clan or private server to realize the potential of the gameplay entirely. \n \nBuilt in Voice Over IP using the best codecs available, with attenuated localized, intra-squad radio, and inter-squad command radio communications. \n \n3 exclusives games modes, with “Base building” and “Base development” game mechanics usually found in Real Time Strategy games. \n \nA Logistics system based around drivable vehicles, designed to support bases in the field, all player maintained. \n \nLarge scale maps from 4km² up to 8km². \n \nHigh-quality and accurate models remodeled from historical references and archives. \n \nA very open development team with excellent community communication, and preparations in progress for mod support near retail release. \n \nInfantry, Logistics, Fortifications and Mechanised Warfare.",

Will Bernard and his friends defeat Purple and save the world? It\u0027s up to you! \n \nAnother time megalomaniac tentacles have to be hunted, insane dialogues will make you laugh and crazy puzzles want to be solved.

You will walk through hand-drawn backgrounds with lovingly animated characters, mood music and soundscape. We do our best to bring the atmosphere and the fun of the old classic to the 21st century. \n \nBesides familiar faces from the predecessors, you\u0027ll also meet guests which actually do their mischief in other games. \n \nThe prologue of our Fan Adventures will be released this summer for Windows, Mac and Linux.",

The two races prefer to avoid contact with each other, but both depend on the Spirit Stones to sustain the balance in the world. Recently, the human army began sweeping across the lands, taking over countries. This army is going after the five great Spirit Stones. The Spirits, however, are determined to prevent this; to achieve their goal, they choose two heroes who would eventually be able to unite the two races in a battle for justice. One of them a is a human nobleman named Kharg, who hates the Deimos and is planning revenge; another is a Deimos slave named Darc, who dreams of uniting and commanding his race. Will the two heroes be able to put aside their differences and save the world?..\n\nArc: Twilight of the Spirits is the fourth entry in the Arc the Lad series. Like its two immediate predecessors, the game has tactical battles which allow free positioning and movement of the characters on the combat field. However, the game is closer to being a \"regular\" Japanese-style role-playing game rather than a tactical RPG. The player controls a relatively small party (up to six active combatants), and is able to explore towns and dungeons in a standard RPG fashion. In the beginning, the game puts the player into control of Kharg, but afterwards the chapters alternate between the human hero and Darc, each with his own party. Characters can use a variety of techniques, accumulating SP (spirit points) in battles and them using them to learn special attacks.",

Like the original, players venture to defeat the mad scientist Doctor Robotnik, who plots to turn the animal population of the fictional South Island into evil robots. Unlike the original, the game features Nintendo\u0027s mascot Mario as the main character rather than Sonic. The title is a portmanteau of \"Sonic\" and \"Mario\".",

    "summary": "Sky Shark (released in Japan as \"Hi Sho Zame\", and in Europe as \"Flying Shark\")is a military-themed vertically scrolling shoot \u0027em up game in which players take control of the titular biplane through five increasingly difficult levels in order to defeat an assortment of military enemy forces like tanks, battleships, airplanes and artillery as the main objective. The title initially appears to be very standard, as players control their plane over a constantly scrolling background and the scenery never stops moving until a runway is reached. Players have only two weapons at their disposal: the standard shot that travels a max distance of the screen\u0027s height and three bombs.\n\nThe bombs are powerful weapons capable of obliterating any enemy caught within its blast radius. Various items are scattered through every stage that appear by destroying certain enemies: Shooting down colored waves of enemy planes spawn items like \"S\" power-up icons, point bonuses and extra lives. Certain enemies on the ground spawn \"B\" icons that increases the player\u0027s bomb stock when destroyed.\nEvery time the player lands at a runway beyond the first takeoff, the amount of bombs multiply 3000 points to the player\u0027s total score.\n\nPlayers are given three lives initially and bonus lives are awarded at 50000 points and thereafter. The game employs a checkpoint system in which a downed single player will start off at the beginning of the checkpoint they managed to reach before dying. Getting hit by enemy fire will result in losing a live, as well as a penalty of decreasing the plane\u0027s firepower to his original state and once all lives are lost, the game is over unless players insert more credits into the arcade machine to continue playing. Completing the last stage restarts the game with the second loop increasing in difficulty.\n\nIn April 2020, M2 announced a new version of Flying Shark as part of their M2 ShotTriggers publishing label. It was first announced to be released on the Nintendo Switch.",

However, the intelligent machines, AIMs, continue to fulfill objectives they are programmed for: further evolution and self-perfection. AIMs of the Reckoners clan built a network of tracks to test multi-purpose combat machines in action.\n\nIf you are not afraid of awesome speed, fatal traps and plasma charges, tearing apart your racing glider’s sheeting, A.I.M. Racing is a game of your choice. There is no need to save money to buy a new glider, no need to think, where you can acquire energy supply for a more powerful canon.

Only the few know that all the worlds are connected to each other with secret passages. Most of these passages are underground, hidden from strangers\u0027 eyes. A casual traveler enters a cave as a shelter from bad weather, but we know it hides a gate to another world. A gate from where unbidden visitors may come. \n \nThe dwarves are guarding the passage secret and keep peace in their world... And now the world shuddered. For the majority it is just a natural disaster. But we know: the world substance is torn, it\u0027s time to take arms, go down and stop the invaders. \n \nYour mission is to purge the dungeons from the evil and gather as much treasures as you can - it will take plenty of gold and diamonds to repair the seal on the Gate between the worlds. \n \nThe Warrior and the Wizard are the greatest heroes of their people. What do you prefer - slashing steel or will-power? Make your choice and start your journey. \n \nRemember, the fate of many worlds depends on you... \n \nBrave Dwarves - Back to treasures is a completely new product. The game offers 100 levels, hard to forget. Now the password system became handier. Also you will find handier password system, striking original music and brand new graphics. The Dwarves became even more attractive. A great deal of amusement is awaiting you and your kids.",

You choose one of three unique pilots; Shin Kazama, Micky Schymon or Greg Gates, each with varying abilities at damage repair, weapon handling and flying skill, and engage the enemy over a series of challenging missions. The player starts out with the weakest plane, the F8E Crusader, which can only be armed with a very basic range weapons. But, through completing various missions, enough cash can be raised to purchase higher-quality aircraft. These superior planes are more agile, have improved resilience to damage and have a greater range of fire. Furthermore, the more advanced fighters can be armed with superior special weapons, such as napalm. The missions include attacks on sand bases, the nuclear submarine \u0027Seavet\u0027 and enemy supply camps, as well as seeing off groups of airborne \u0027bandits\u0027 who swarm-in on Area 88.

    "summary": "What happens when you take classic puzzle gaming and toss in some of the most lovable characters in cartoon history? You get one undeniably awesome game. Buster Bunny, Plucky Duck, and the rest of the TINY TOONS crew are ready for fun, and you\u0027re in the driver\u0027s seat. The basic premise of this addicting, original title is to arrange pairs of colored eggs, dropping them onto the screen to create combinations. Of course, there are numerous obstacles and would-be detractors to make things more difficult (UFOs, Tasmanian Devils), and time is never on your side. There are plenty of characters from the animated series along for the adventure including Hampton J. Pig and Fifi La Fume and each is prepared for puzzle-style battle. As many as four players can link up to see who has the quickest reflexes, and there are plenty of single-player modes to keep you busy as well. If you\u0027re a TINY TOONS fan, this one is a must-have. If you\u0027re not a fan well, you should be.",

Because wherever the postman comes with the letter, the Neustadt citizens fall in love: the policeman falls in love with the traffic light, the neighbors with Bernhard Blocksberg and Ms. Kolumna with their own reflection in a mirror! A funny sight, but now the city is upside down - the Neustadt newspaper cannot be printed, the cars are stuck in a traffic jam and the neighbors want to kiss Bernhard. In 12 individual games, the players help Bibi to put everything back in order and undo the witchcraft of love. They have to step in for Bibi\u0027s friends selling ice cream, sort articles for the Neustadt newspaper, take on a ship christening or save Bernhard from the kisses of the neighbors.",

When a line is made, it will disappear, and everything above it will drop down. Every ten lines you make, the level will go up, and the speed will increase.\n\nYou gain points for the speed you play each brick. So, by dropping a brick to the bottom, it will have been played faster, and you will gain extra points. You will also gain points for the more lines you make at once. For example, if you make four lines at once, you get more than four times the points earned when you get one line.\nAlso, you can see the next piece you\u0027ll get in the NEXT section.

The World Cup tournament is featured in full, and you can adjust which 24 teams this features, a particularly crucial feature for English and French fans, as their nations failed to qualify. For the first time in the series an on-screen referee is featured. The club team data has been updated to take into account transfers and kit changes since the previous version. Gameplay is much the same as previous editions, being viewed from above with small sprites and loose ball control.",

The game was released for PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 on January 18, 2011 in North America,[1] January 21, 2011 in Europe, January 27, 2011 in Japan and February 10, 2011 in Australia. The game was originally planned to be released in October 2010 for North America and Europe but it was pushed back to January 2011. MindJack takes place in 2031, when the world’s governments are in decline and new corrupt organizations are arising. The player can “hack” into and control enemies, vehicles, robots, or civilians.[2] In the campaign story mode, the game is single-player but “transitions seamlessly” into co-op.[2]",

Aside from the traditional third-person-view, there is now a first-person mode which is used to control the main character when he is in his apartment. Objects that can be interacted with are highlighted by eyeball icons. The previous games in the series have mostly been about exploring the town and solving puzzles, but this installment has much more combat involved. There are more enemies in a given area, spread in cramped spaces. The main character mostly uses a standard Silent Hill arsenal of weapons, such as the steel pipe, pistol and a golf club.",

Before taking off, the player can choose between different aircrafts, each with different strengths and weaknesses.\n\nWithin the missions the player gets different objectives like patrolling, sneaking, hit \u0026 run, bombing and escorting. Objectives are presented as dialogues between different characters. After some missions the player can upgrade one of his skills in order to maneuver the airplanes easier, have more endurance or have your wingman boosted. Further, the player can choose between two control schemes. Arcade and simulation. The first one makes the game easier to control, while the second one gives more options to control the aircraft.\n\nBeside the campaign the game also features several multiplayer modes, local and via internet for up to four players.",

Renamed Penny Racers for the benefit of American sales, the wind-up cars were built to perform different tricks (wheelies and spins, mostly) when a penny was inserted into their chassis. The plastic racers are still very popular in Japan, inspiring a video game called CHORO-Q ADVANCE. The U.S. release of the game is called GADGET RACERS, and it\u0027s every bit as exciting as the toys that it\u0027s based on. Command any of 50 unique vehicles through 40 different courses of obstacles, tricks, and general mayhem. You can customize your racer to meet your specifications, using more than 130 different parts to soup things up upgrade your tires, brakes, steering, engines, and more. Adding to the excitement is the fact that you can get four players competing for glory via a link cable and for Game Boy Advance consoles. It\u0027s a mystery why the toys no longer roam the bedroom floors of American households, but maybe this awesome video game will create a resurgence.",

    "summary": "When Ichigo’s parents realize their daughter’s dream is to own and run a bakery they do everything they can to force her away from such a career and toward a more prestigious calling. However, in a fit of determination and frustration, Ichigo moves out and on her own with the desire to prove just how serious she is about her sweet passion.\n\nAfter a brief amount of time, Ichigo stumbles upon Sugar’s Delight; a small bakery owned by the somewhat oblivious, but mature and incredibly kind “Chocoa”. In no time at all, Ichigo is working her dream job and learning everything there is to know about running a bakery, and things hardly seem like they could get any better…\n\nThat is, until Ichigo begins obtaining more than just lessons about how to bake the most delicious of strawberry cakes. Chocoa eventually begins making advances on the naïve Ichigo, and the only aspect of the newest ingredient in the young woman’s life that she’s apprehensive about is how much she doesn’t mind the older girl’s touch!",

Each character is rated A, B or C with a bar scale highlighting their personal strengths and weaknesses. Comparable to the best beat-em-ups they are all remarkably dissimilar to control therefore each will provide a unique challenge in their own right. Some move extremely swiftly but may only carry a hand pistol while others are a little slower off the mark but are packed with high-power weapons of destruction.\n\n- Versus Mode is your typical beat-em-up, one vs one, battle to the death. Taking place in an enclosed arena two of the selectable fighters enter into a gun battl. Scattered around each arena are a number of obstacles that may be used for cover therefore speed of movement becomes a great leveler.\n\n- Story Mode: You are allowed 99 seconds to complete each of numerous screens where there are several enemies to eliminated before the exit is revealed. Any obstacles standing in your way may be slowly destroyed by constant firing of your gun or taking the quick fix which involves lobbing a few of your limited grenades. After completing each level you must face one of the remaining selectable characters in a battle to the death.",
