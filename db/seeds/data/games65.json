The game was often considered frustrating for its length and lack of a save or password system. Phfax, a mystic being and wielder of the Emerald Magic, consented to offer his life to protect the stones of Rune. For centuries he dwelled within the plasma of energies of the stones where the Runes were hidden. Until at last it drove him insane. Such was the power of the stone that even the bitter hallucinations of his madness were given life. Six deadly beings appeared stealing the Rune Stones. You, Cebo, the most promising of the young Magicians of Dace, must enter the castle, exploring the realities. But do not trust your senses - what you see, what you hear may all be a lie!","tags":[1,17,268435464,268435487,536871059,536871138,536871208,536871939,536872139,536875362],"videos":[{"id":2938,"video_id":"HnIL3hsYTlc"}]},{"id":47464,"cover":{"id":186802,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co404y.jpg"},"name":"Ninja Gaiden 3 Collector's Edition","platforms":[{"id":12,"name":"Xbox 360"}],"summary":"Ninja Gaiden 3 Collector's Edition\n\nFeaturing a new story, new gameplay and new modes, NINJA GAIDEN 3 marks a new direction in this fan-favorite franchise.

is a digital collectible card and turn-based strategy game that takes place on a dynamic playing board set in a fantasy universe. Players in Faeria battle one-on-one against other players or computer-controlled opponents. Battles take place on a empty hex board and the goal for each player is to reduce the opponent's avatar health to zero before their own is exhausted. Part of the game's strategy is managing the placement of tiles on the board to create routes for one's creatures to reach the opponent while limiting progress from the opponent.\n\nWinning games earns in-game currency that can be used to purchase new packs of cards, from which the player can then customize their deck. Support for the iOS and Android versions of the game were dropped in 2018 to focus on the PC version. The game also moved out of its free-to-play model and announced plans for card expansion DLCs around the same time.","tags":[17,268435465,268435471,268435472,268435480,268435487,268435488,268435491,536871208,536871394,536872835,536872837,536873247,536874083,536874694,536875586,536876217,536894781,536897214],"videos":[{"id":9362,"video_id":"1XAaVqtVkfg"},{"id":12562,"video_id":"n5IxFzyCU3I"}]},{"id":151078,"cover":{"id":184146,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co3y36.jpg"},"name":"PSweet","platforms":[{"id":6,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"},{"id":14,"name":"Mac"}],"screenshots":[{"id":480957,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scab3x.jpg"},{"id":480960,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scab40.jpg"},{"id":480962,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scab42.jpg"},{"id":480964,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scab44.jpg"},{"id":480965,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scab45.jpg"},{"id":480967,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scab47.jpg"},{"id":480969,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scab49.jpg"},{"id":480971,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scab4b.jpg"},{"id":480972,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scab4c.jpg"},{"id":480973,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scab4d.jpg"}],"summary":"Date productivity applications in a retro, hand-drawn dating simulator set in a fictional operating system that definitely doesn't have a horrible secret.","tags":[268435469,268435488]},{"id":65911,"cover":{"id":44498,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/hvuvn6sa4jwra12ci3i2.jpg"},"name":"Fighting For One Piece","platforms":[{"id":8,"name":"PlayStation 2"}],"summary":"Fighting For One Piece is a fighting game for the Playstation 2 console inspired by the successful One Piece anime.

Ad Wars is a multi-genre adventure with different difficulty levels that welcomes newcomers and hardcore players alike.\n\nDivided into 3 episodes, you'll find yourself jumping and shooting the mischievous yet endearing Gengens in Super Freemium Lands, taking on all sorts of monsters RPG-style in Clickbait Kingdom, and unearthing the mysteries of Download Highways, a screwball Maze Crawler section. Oh, and did we mention there's also bullet hell mania?\n\nIf there's one thing we encourage the player to have to fully savor Ad Wars, it's an open mind. Traditional -and perhaps untraditional at times- way of thinking might get you to a certain point, but bizarre logic could be what gets you far.\n\nThat sounds cool! What's the story behind it?\n\nFate dealt humanity a swift and merciless hand one day. In what came to be known as the Ad-Pocalypse, anti-ad forces fought relentlessly against Ad Corporations but were completely decimated. Now, overrun by ads, the world is far from what it used to be, and it's up to no other than Alt, the sole survivor of this cataclysm, to wage a last stand and free the world from the bane of ads once and for all.\n\nAd Wars is set on the internet, where portals and vortexes are commonplace. Be prepared, it won't take just a few data packets to end this quest; the virtual road ahead is not just perilous, but long. Alt, however, won't be alone; with the special guidance of the trusty and quirky Magna, whacky characters joining in, and, of course, your help, his chances couldn't be better!\n\nEarly Access Out Now!","tags":[1,268435461,268435464,268435468,268435487,268435488,536871756,536872961],"videos":[{"id":22479,"video_id":"QK0XJq9oB00"}]},{"id":23156,"cover":{"id":16902,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/jozs8eaiubioq0w8gsxe.jpg"},"name":"Worst Case Z","platforms":[{"id":6,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}],"screenshots":[{"id":30644,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/b6xzz9jfgjizrc20rvcb.jpg"},{"id":30645,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/uuypj7qbmzrwolfmqqth.jpg"},{"id":30646,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/mmdkeaee2iyswntntjuw.jpg"},{"id":30647,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/ls3paw6lvs5ar04biwb2.jpg"},{"id":30648,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/iiktjznvib7ptyop7elu.jpg"}],"summary":"Worst Case Z is a first-person survival horror game, in which you take a role of security worker in a nuclear power plant in the middle of a city.

The game is brimming over with riffs and variants on that core mechanic with 20 game modes, dozens of special blocks and items, and 115 levels in the adventure mode alone. The basic rules of the game are this: blocks fall down into the board and have a color and an arrow direction. If a stack of blocks exceeds the height of the board, you lose. In order to clear blocks, you must right-click and drag paths through the arrows to set up chain reactions of like-colored blocks. \n \nIf this sounds simple, that's because it is -- you'll be lining up lengthy chains within minutes. But you'll be surprised how much brainpower it takes to set up combos of multiple chains, and the many brainteaser-style puzzles include some real stumpers. Tidalis has co-op and competitive multiplayer modes (both online and offline); action-oriented modes and timer-less brainteasers; a lengthy, casual-friendly adventure mode; twenty unique game modes providing innumerable twists to the basic gameplay; dozens of special blocks and items; and over fifty minutes of beautiful music to go with the painterly art. \n \nIn short, several games' worth of content are built on top of this core mechanic, which you'll quickly find to be as iconic as it is novel.","tags":[268435465,268435488,536870992,536871049,536871506,536871645,536871672,536871878,536871931,536871958,536872010,536872070,536872120,536872140,536872205,536872211,536872617,536872622,536872647,536872957,536873021,536873027,536873224,536873249,536873362,536873440,536873787,536874542,536874706,536874916,536875042,536875046,536875063,536875074,536875089,536875096,536875100,536875107,536875124,536875125,536875130,536875200,536875232,536875244,536875315,536875322,536875335,536875379,536875396,536875440,536875488,536875489,536875494,536875507,536875523,536875550,536875606,536875661,536875665,536875670,536875672,536875699,536875745,536875752,536875792,536875852,536875855,536875870,536875896,536875901,536876018,536876026,536876029,536876034,536876063,536876069,536876095,536876108,536876124,536876174,536876263,536876266,536876274,536876277,536876331,536876375,536876424,536876432,536876466,536876474,536876475,536876499,536876528,536876540,536876558,536876569,536876875,536876915,536877587,536877805,536877914,536878379,536882498,536882675],"videos":[{"id":5440,"video_id":"_L28SWHTgqM"}]},{"id":126856,"cover":{"id":177637,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co3t2d.jpg"},"name":"Project Grove","platforms":[{"id":6,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}],"screenshots":[{"id":361993,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc7rbd.jpg"},{"id":361996,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc7rbg.jpg"},{"id":619252,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scd9tg.jpg"},{"id":619253,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scd9th.jpg"},{"id":619254,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scd9ti.jpg"},{"id":619255,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scd9tj.jpg"},{"id":619256,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scd9tk.jpg"},{"id":619257,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scd9tl.jpg"},{"id":619258,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scd9tm.jpg"},{"id":619456,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scd9z4.jpg"}],"summary":"Project Grove is a first-person adventure puzzle game set in a magical wild forest during an industrial Steampunk era.\nExplore the Forest of Dacrima as legendary alchemist Edric Tate, with your plucky robot companion L-P1N!

The objective is to fill a 9×9 grid with digits so that each column, each row, and each of the nine 3×3 subgrids that compose the grid (also called \"boxes\", \"blocks\", or \"regions\") contains all of the digits from 1 to 9. \n \nJigsaw Sudoku: \n \nThe rules of Jigsaw Sudoku are similar to standard Sudoku since you must place each of the numbers 1 to 9 (or 1 to whatever the size of the puzzle is) into each of the rows and columns. However, whereas standard Sudoku also has rectangular boxes that must each contain every number, in Jigsaw Sudoku these boxes are replaced by different bold-lined shapes that must each contain every number instead. © \n \nKiller Sudoku: \n \nKiller Sudoku puzzles include all the rules of regular Sudoku but add in dashed-line 'cages' which must sum to given values. Killer Sudoku is also sometimes known as Sumdoku, Mathdoku or Addoku. The name 'Killer' Sudoku arises because of the wicked twist on the standard Sudoku puzzle, since you must not only place each of the numbers 1 to 9 (or 1 to the size of the puzzle) into each of the rows, columns, and bold-lined 3x3 (or other sizes) boxes but you must also place the numbers into each dashed-line cage so that they add up to its given total - and without repeating a digit in a dashed-line cage.","tags":[268435465,268435471,268435491,536873156],"videos":[{"id":29883,"video_id":"9KXcp8umSWA"}]},{"id":138150,"cover":{"id":113675,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co2fpn.jpg"},"name":"Renga in Four Parts","platforms":[{"id":3,"name":"Linux"},{"id":6,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"},{"id":14,"name":"Mac"},{"id":82,"name":"Web browser"}],"summary":"This is interactive poetry: you can type particular words that occur in the text, or words that are implied.
