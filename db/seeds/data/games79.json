Immerse yourself into a decadent urban sprawl, all while working precarious jobs where you will either be absorbed into the system, or cast out of society’s machine. Damnview: Built From Nothing is a game about despair, the hostility of capitalism, and the need of seeking for a better future. The city you dwell in takes on its own role as the machine that capitalism feeds – a machine that can swallow you whole and spit you out a broken person. How far you’re willing to go to survive and succeed in a place like this is in your hands, and sometimes being smarter, meaner or just not giving a damn is the pathway to success. The size of the scar you leave on the city streets depends entirely on you and your decisions, the people you meet, the people you help or the people you choose to hurt.",

It was during this era that the Spanish resistance gave their style of fighting its name: Guerrilla, or the “little war”. \n \nIt is 1811 and the war in the Spanish Peninsula has been raging for over two years, with mixed fortunes and heavy casualties for both sides. Following the withdrawal from the Madrid area of the combined armies of Great Britain, Portugal and Spain after the Battle of Talavera in July 1809, Viscount Wellington retreated into Portugal and consolidated his forces. Now Napoleon’s Armée d\u0027Espagne, has invaded Portugal once again but thus far the network of entrenchments has proved impossible for the French to successfully assail. \n \nWellington has planned a fresh offensive to drive the invaders out of Portugal and eventually out of the Peninsula altogether. Although forced back to the edges of their Peninsula by France and the traitors who helped them, Spain is not yet out of the fight. The Supreme Central Junta and its successor the Supreme Regency authorised the forming of local bands to fight guerrilla - the “little war” - against the invaders. \nChoose one of the three nations involved - France, Great Britain or Spain - and experience one the most intense conflict of the Napoleonic era.",

    "summary": "Hammer \u0026 Sickle is a turn-based strategy game with role playing elements that uses the Silent Storm engine and universe. The year is 1949, with the Cold War between the US and Soviet Union looming and both sides uneasy at the thought of an atomic war occurring. The player takes the role of a Soviet commando on an undercover mission to meet a contact in Allied-occupied Germany. However, things go badly for this meeting, leaving the protagonist without proper support, equipment, and identification papers. Behind Allied-occupied lines, the player must attempt to stop a rogue third party intent on initiating World War III between the US and Russia. \n \nPlayers can choose to start with one of 6 player classes: Soldier, Grenadier, Scout, Sniper, Medic, and Engineer. Additionally, there are opportunities throughout the game to recruit additional characters to round out the party\u0027s abilities. The game itself features a branching plot where the player\u0027s actions and dealings with NPC\u0027s can have serious consequences later on. For example, an intelligent character may be able to talk his way out of a situation, and killing Allied soldiers may prompt more patrols later on and slide the situation towards World War III. \n \nHammer \u0026 Sickle also features heavy squad-based combat, and it inherits the turn-based engine from Silent Storm. Players spend Action Points to perform various actions in battle each turn, while the enemy does the same. The engine also models realistic looking physics that feature ragdoll animations, bullet ricochet, and destructible environments. As for available equipment, there are 90 weapons and variants that can be found or bought.",

Please answer things like: \"What did you enjoy?\", \"What did you dislike?\", \"What do you wish was included?\" and so on. Also, while I did my best to rid the game of all the bugs I could, please report any you may have found and what you were doing when it occurred.   \n   \nKeep in mind that this is just a demo, and what is shown does not necessarily represent the finished product. Some issues you may encounter are known and all levels are subject to improvement.   \n   \nThis is my first game, so please be gentle ;)   \n   \nThank you so much for playing, and I hope you enjoy!   \n   \n-Pie On A Plate Productions   \n   \n(Just David Campbell III for now.)   \n   \nPS.   \n   \nIf the game stutters or lags too much, turn down the settings. This can be achieved in the launcher that appears right when the .exe is clicked, or in the options menu in the game itself by hitting the ESC key.   \n   \nThis is a puzzle game as well as a horror game. Use your surroundings for clues.   \n   \n**Donations are greatly appreciated and allow me to continue to learn, grow, and create games like this one (and hopefully even better!)**   \n   \nContact with bugs, suggestions, or anything in between at:    \n   \npieonaplateproductions@gmail.com",

    "summary": "This game was released only in Japan. It is the fourth game in the Puyo Puyo series and the last set during the Madou-era in the main series.\nContinuing the trend of naming the games after puns, the name comes from a pun on \"yon\", the Japanese word for the number 4, but this time this is the only reference to the pun.\n\nThe gameplay in is similar to that of Puyo Puyo 2, but adds super attacks. Clearing chains now builds up a \"charge meter\" which allows players to use them. The only other addition was a new game mode which could be played with a number of different field sizes, smaller or bigger than the standard 6x12, however, it removes several game modes that were present in Puyo Puyo Sun, i.e. the tournament, task and chain training modes. The art is also vastly different to the previous game in the series and, of course, the Fever series; this style was only otherwise used for Minna de Puyo Puyo.\n\nSTORY:\nSatan has released an odd demon called Pierott. Pierott invites Arle and Carbuncle over to the “Puyo Puyo Circus”. All seemed to be just fine, Arle and Carbuncle went into a tent to watch a magic show, but Satan had Carbuncle volunteer for a magic trick he was doing. A magic trick? Or a trap? He puts Carbuncle on the stand, and casts a spell, which makes Carbuncle, disappear! Arle wasn\u0027t worried, she didn\u0027t even know what was going on, but later on, she couldn\u0027t find Carbuncle anywhere! She then has to start battling monsters and oddball characters in a match of Puyo Puyo to try to reach Satan, and get Carbuncle back!\n\nThis version of the game have different music and lacks the voiced cutscenes due to cartridge\u0027s memory limitations, but can be played in 4-player mode like the Dreamcast version and included a Transfer Pack mode where one could unlock more artwork by plugging in Pocket Puyo Puyo Sun.",

Can he survive battles against evil creatures in the seven elemental realms of Valoria?\n\nSpellcraft: Aspects of Valor is a strategy game based on spell creation and large-scale battles.

The game only features the 20 drivers that started the 2009 Formula One season, and does not include the driver changes that were made during the season. There are 15 driver aids each switchable on and off for first time and experienced players, and in the multiplayer version, the level of help changes according to the player\u0027s skill, by using a \"Fair Play\" system. The game features slick tyres,[6] as well as the newly-introduced KERS concept, although the game has the feature on all the cars, not just the few that actually used it in the motor racing series. The game offers several different gameplay modes: Quick Race, Time Trial, and a two-player split-screen mode on the Wii.",

The game also features more cars than Cruis\u0027n USA. This game introduced stunts to the Cruis\u0027n series. They served to dodge obstacles, take close curves and so. If the stunt makes the vehicle fly in the air, the game gives the player extra seconds of time. The game also uses small rocket boosts to speed up. The game was later released on the Nintendo 64 in 1998, being the best received of the Cruis\u0027n ports.",

An airliner is hijacked by terrorists en-route from Paris to Boston, who threaten to kill all hostages on board if their mates aren\u0027t released from jail. Instead of reaching its destination, the airliner makes a landing in Kalubya, Africa, and all the hostages are hidden in various locations. The authorities have asked the hero from Operation Wolf to rescue the hostages, but only this time, the hero brings his friend along for the ride.\n\nThere are eight missions to complete in Operation Thunderbolt, and each one has you shooting down soldiers, choppers, and tanks. The gameplay varies every one or two missions. In some missions, you are driving a jeep or controlling a boat, while in others, you are walking while you\u0027re shooting. You have a limited supply of ammo, and a limited supply of rocket bombs, but you can always stock up by shooting down crates falling from the sky, or by killing a cat or dog that get in the line of fire. Also from crates, you can get special items like bulletproof vests, rocket bombs, and different weapons.",

    "summary": "A part of the Metroid series, it features gameplay in both first- and third-person perspectives, and is the first installment of the franchise to feature melee attacks which could only be executed when an enemy\u0027s health was reduced to a certain degree.\nThe game gave significant focus on plot and characterization, with extensive usage of cinematics and voice acting.\n\nThe regular gameplay features a third person perspective, where players hold the Wii Remote horizontally. Samus can jump, fire the arm cannon, and turn into a morph ball, which can roll into narrow passages and drop energy bombs. While gameplay is similar to early Metroid titles, the game\u0027s environments are three-dimensional and movement is not limited to a two-dimensional plane. Other M is the first in the series to feature a melee combat system. With well-timed button presses, players can use special techniques such as the Sense Move, which allows them to dodge enemy attacks, and the Overblast, where Samus jumps on the enemy and fires a charged shot at point-blank range.\n\nWhen the Wii Remote is pointed towards the screen, the angle switches to a first-person view, where players can lock onto targets and fire missiles; however, players cannot move in this perspective. There are several instances where players will have to constantly switch between play modes; for example, fighting off a horde of flying enemies in third person, while switching to first person to destroy their spawn points. Additionally, the first-person mode is also used in exploration, such as locating hidden items.",

    "summary": "Terrene is a new sequel to the Sci-Fi action game Evidence of Life, it is created by Justwall Games and Albatross Wirehead. Terrene is a retro action adventure game with survival elements. You explore a giant procedural world to complete your mission tasks. Freely fly your ship from your orbiting space station down to the planets surface and disembark to play on foot and explore vast cave systems. \n \nMine ores then store them on your ship to deliver to the oribiter. Once delivered you can use them to upgrade your player, weapons and ship. Your tasks include gathering a set amount of bio material from the planets fauna and foliage, harvesting the planet hearts (bosses), and finding hidden alien relics. The more you harvest the planet the more alien threat will increase unlocking different enemy types and increasing danger on the planet. \n \nTerrene is part survival game. You have limited oxygen on the surface, explore as much as you can before returning to your ship. Upgrade your player to increase your oxygen so you can spend more time and dig deeper. Player health can only be restored by harvesting planet fauna. Dying will return you to your ship and leave behind a backpack that you will need to retrieve to get your inventory back. Dying again will mean the backpack is lost forever. \n \nUse certain ores types to unlock and upgrade different primary and secondary weapons. Weapons to unlock include, rifle, shotgun, sniper lazer, and flame thrower. Secondary weapons include grenades, shield, mines and cluster mines. Homing missiles and bombs can be unlocked for your ship. Choose which weapons you prefer and spend your upgrades however you see fit. \n \nThe Terrene world is procedurally generated by a seed of your choosing, it is 5000 blocks wide and is made up of ten different randomly generated biomes. Each biome contains its own plant and rock types, procedural textures, its own enemy spawn set, ore spawn rates and landscape style. Use your ship to quickly traverse the landscape, and set down wherever you would like to explore. The in game mini map uncovers where you have you explored to help keep track of where you have been.",

A fourth game type, Fortress (large scale fortress sieges), was being developed but never finished. Players progressed in ranks, won equipment, and bought skills and abilities which they used to build their character in a completely free-form skill-based system. You could save your equipment and ability layout as an \"incarnation\" and switch incarnation between war zones. There was no specific player \u0027class\u0027 as in other MMOs nor did you need to have alternate characters to explore other character aspects as you could just rebuild a different incarnation of yourself.",

This is the second of three video games released under the Empire Strikes Back title for home video game systems. It was preceded by a version for the Atari 2600 and succeeded by Super Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back for the SNES. \n \nThe NES version was released the same year as JVC\u0027s Super Star Wars for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System. As Empire was released towards the end of the NES\u0027s lifecycle, a corresponding sequel to the film Return of the Jedi was never developed, nor released. \n \nA version of the game was released for the Game Boy. That product was reprinted and distributed by several publishers over the course of three years.\"",

    "summary": "Punch-Out!!, originally released in North America as Mike Tyson\u0027s Punch-Out!!, is a boxing sports fighting video game for the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) developed and published by Nintendo in 1987. Part of the Punch-Out!! series, it is a port of both the Punch-Out!! and Super Punch-Out!! arcade games (particularly the latter) with some variations.\nPunch-Out!! features a boxer known as Little Mac working his way up the professional boxing circuits, facing a series of colorful, fictional boxers, leading to a final fight with real-life boxer, the then-World Heavyweight Champion, which is Mike Tyson in the original version and Mr. Dream in the later version.\nLittle Mac has a limited repertoire compared to most of his opponents. His punches are limited to left and right jabs, left and right body blows, and a powerful uppercut. The uppercut can only be used once the player earns a star, which is typically accomplished by counter-punching the opponent directly before or after certain attacks are launched. The player can acquire up to three stars. To perform the uppercut, the player needs to press the start button once a star is earned. To defend, Mac can dodge left or right, duck, and block punches by putting up his guard.\nLittle Mac also has a heart meter, which decreases by three upon being struck by an opponent and one upon blocking an attack or an opponent blocking/dodging the player\u0027s attack. When the heart meter decreases to zero, Little Mac temporarily turns pink and appears exhausted, leaving the player unable to attack but still able to dodge or block. At this point, Mac can regain some hearts (and his normal color palette) only by avoiding the opponent\u0027s punches. He immediately loses all of his hearts upon being knocked down, but can regain some by getting up.\nA bout can end by knockout (KO), if a fighter is unable to get up within ten seconds after being knocked down; by technical knockout (TKO), if a fighter is knocked down three times in one round; or by decision, if the bout lasts three full rounds without a clear winner. In order to win by decision, the player must accumulate higher than a certain point total by punching the opponent and/or knocking him down (different boxers require different point totals to win by decision). However, some bouts cannot be won in this manner and will automatically result in a loss for the player if the opponent is not knocked out. Mac can only get up three times during any one bout; if he is knocked down a fourth time, he will be unable to rise and thus lose by knockout.\nWhen Mac loses his first bout to a ranked opponent, he will have a chance to fight a rematch. However, if he loses a Title Bout, he will fall in the rankings - one place for the Minor or Major Circuits, two places for the World Circuit. Losing a rematch causes him to fall one place (unless he is already at the bottom of his circuit), forcing him to fight his way back up. A third loss (not necessarily a consecutive one) ends the game. The exception is the final fight against Mike Tyson/Mr. Dream; a loss to them automatically results in a game over.",
