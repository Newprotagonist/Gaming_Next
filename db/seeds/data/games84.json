In order to gain additional funds for the war effort, the Crown raise taxes from the New World colonies without representation. This act compels the New World colonies to protest and boycott against British rule. By 1775, the Crown alarmed by the protests, boycotts and politically instability in the New World sends troops to subdue any rebellious efforts by the New World colonists. This threatening approach provokes the Thirteen Colonies to revolt. Thus starts the War for Independence in the New World (American Revolutionary War).",

In the span of two generations the town was built up to the status of prestige it now commands, an expansion helmed by the Hadou Group, an industrial complex and family dynasty currently run by the young Hadou Ruri. She pursues the peace and prosperity of Arkham diligently, against the forces of darkness threatening to plunge the city, and the world, back into a second dark age. Among the most sinister threats to Arkham City is the evil Black Lodge syndicate. Led by the charismatic Master Therion, his nihilistic outlook shapes the group\u0027s destructive goals: with a circle of powerful sorcerers at his command, the potential for sowing chaos in the city is unmatched.\n\nFormer Miskatonic University Magic Academy student Daijuuji Kurou knows little of grimoires, but what he does know terrifies him - enough that he left his university life behind, and now practices a failing detective business in the shelter of an orphanage in a quiet corner of Arkham. But just when he thought his Academy past was buried, it catches up with him and pulls him back into the dark shadows of the occult: Hadou Ruri herself appears at his door with an offer he can\u0027t refuse. The only way to combat the Black Lodge\u0027s growing magical power is to find, and retrieve, a grimoire with the power to activate the mightiest Machina of all: Demonbane. The quest to find this forbidden tome will change Kurou\u0027s destiny... forever.",

From a simple game of tag to a run-and-jump obstacle course, each lesson is broken down into multiple, manageable segments that let kids go at their own pace—and have fun in the process. Learn the basics of visual game programming By playing through interactive lessons, kids will learn the basics of visual game programming. Nodon, colorful creatures with distinct personalities, keep kids engaged through lessons with tips and motivating messages. With a simple press of a button, swap between the programming screen and the game screen—watch how programming changes the game on the fly. Track progress and build confidence After completing each lesson and building a game, kids will test their knowledge by completing Checkpoints—small puzzles or tasks to solve with programming. Master these skills and head to Free Programming mode to let your imagination (and programming chops) run wild. The Nodon you meet each have distinct personalities that complement their functions. Have fun connecting them together to see how they interact and bring your game to life. The in-game Nodopedia lets you quickly check what each Nodon does as you create. There’s also a guide that recaps important skills! Easily swap between the Programming and Game screens to see the hard-working Nodon in action.

    "summary": "Somewhere in London is a secret organization that is based on the 13th floor of an office building. The sole purpose for this organization’s existence is to keep the current British government in power at any cost - specifically, that means helping the current Prime Minister keep ahead of his competition in the polls.\n\nFloor 13 is a management simulation controlled by a menu-based system (similar to Darklands) and is presented in black and white for a film noir feel. Players take the role of the Director General in this secret organization, and are given a target date of 20 days to attend to their duties. During this period, performance will be evaluated based on the Prime Minister\u0027s polling results. If the PM is doing well, the agency will be expanded and will have more equipment and services available to handle the situations it will encounter later in the game. If the PM is behind, Floor 13 risks reduction in the number of services it has available or even the player\u0027s continued employment. After each successful 20 day period, another 20 days are added to the calendar, full of new problems and objectives.\n\nDuring the time between target dates, players will have to deal with various problems, both externally and internally. Some examples include: saving the son of the U.S. President from terrorists, breaking up a drug ring controlled by a VIP recently honored by the Queen, or even prevent a scientist in the British space agency from publicly stating that their latest achievement has been a total sham (shades of the film \"Capricorn One\"). While you are completing these tasks there is another secret society that will pressure you to have its goals completed, and this may very well interfere with the missions officially assigned to Floor 13.\n\nThe Floor 13 organization is not a benevolent one and players will need to do some rather unpleasant things to ensure that the democratic machine runs smoothly. Examples of activities include: searching and looting people’s homes, calling in commando units for heavy assault purposes, wire-tapping and trailing people without bothering to go through legal channels, discrediting notable people through the media and infiltrating established organizations. At times, you might even need to detain citizens and torture them (the torture bits can get rather graphic at times, though it\u0027s doled out through a text report), or even assassinate troublesome proles (one of the few political policy games, along with Shadow President and CyberJudas, to allow for such an activity). However if players become too eager at performing these \"black hat\" activities, they may draw too much attention to the agency and may summon the attention of a certain \"Mr. Garcia\" (who is good at helping noisy Director Generals fly through office windows).",

Styled similar to cinematography found in The Wachowskis\u0027 The Matrix film franchise and gameplay mechanics in games such as Dead to Rights and Max Payne, the player is given an ability to slow down time and thus dodge multitudes of flying bullets and other obstacles. The first level, \"enhancement\", slows down all action, including the player character. The second level, \"Blitz\", slows down only the enemies, allowing the player to move around at normal speed. The third level, \"frozen time\", halts everything around the player, who again maintains normal speed. By pressing the shoulder buttons, the player can lock-onto and switch aim at the various enemies. Successfully dispatching several foes in a row earns the player bonus points, which can be used at the end of a stage to purchase upgrades like more health, as well as special attacks and acrobatic evasion skills that can be mapped to certain controller buttons. The game features four playable characters (Crow, Alice, Dragon, and Boris), each of which has their own unique set of abilities. Between the action sequences, the player must advance the plot through a graphic adventure-style interface, where certain characters must be spoken to in order to continue.",

It\u0027s a part of the Simple 2000 series by Japanese publisher D3 Publisher, as part of a series of budget priced games that usually sell at 2000¥.\n\nYou play as Aya, a scantily clad cowgirl with a scarf, in a hack-and-slash against slow-moving zombies in little arena\u0027s. There is a feature called \"sword fatigue\": if you don\u0027t clean your sword in time, it will get stuck in an enemy, giving him an advantage over you. There are also slight RPG elements. You can upgrade your characters by collecting orbs dropped by defeated enemies. At the end of each level, you can use the orbs to make Aya more powerful. Sometimes the enemies drop red orbs; if you collect enough of them, you turn into a demon. Your attacks become more powerful, but they also take away from your health.",

Living as a mould, stretching threads through an infected area like deadly toadstools. The center of this \"being?\" deep in the under world is the giant daemon, Skarborr.GAMEPLAY\nYou, the player, take the role of the young, inexperienced dragon. In the role of the savior of Nimoa you move through the skies and faces all the challenges of the evil Skarborr. At the beginning of the game the player has the choice of three dragons: Annoth The Fire Breather, Barroth the magician and Morrogh The Necromancer. All three are different and all three have their own ways of dealing with the great many adversaries you will meet. You also develop the dragon\u0027s combat abilities throughout the game to deal with the increasingly tough and resilient enemies, until you meet and conquer Skarborr himself.\n\nThat is not all, you will also need to control other characters and complete important tasks on the path to overall victory: a warlord and his steed on a potentially fatal fact finding mission, the thoroughly competent hunter on a mission of delicate accuracy and selective killing and the three huge creatures and their riders in an attempt to destroy magical generators keeping the dragons away from the next big fight.\n\nThrough 12 enormous and differing geographical areas the task is not only to hunt and destroy despicable monsters, but to build, maintain and defend human settlements. A dragon\u0027s individual character, breathtakingly fluid graphics and addictively exhausting aerial combat bring you many hours of sometimes sweat generating gameplay.\n\nYou will also fall under the spell of \"The I of the Dragon\" with its mystical atmosphere, impressive sunrises and colorful but ominous sunsets, for who knows what the night will bring.",

You can beat your friends mainly by shooting them with hilariously oversize bullets or catapult them of the map by making them drive into one of your deadly mines. \n \nBut beating your friends is not just about destroying them. You can win points by evading mines dropping from the sky, not touching the ground when the volcano erupts or by not falling off the map when gravity starts to shift. To make the whole situation even more chaotic, you can destroy the whole map with your bullets and mines. If your enemy thinks he is safe on the bridge he is wrong, because it suddenly collapses as your mines detonate below it and send him flying off the map. \n \nYou can beat your friends in local multiplayer or fight with total strangers online.",

Spins give you the power to dictate whether you will use them yourself, to increase your total prize money, or force them on others in the hopes they will land on a Whammy. One Whammy will erase a contestant\u0027s score, and four will remove them from the game.",

Marrying fresh features with classic RTS gameplay, Age of Empires Online pays tribute to the original game while incorporating a new look, feel, and approach that appeals to long-time fans, newcomers, and everyone in between.  \n  \nAge of Empires Online has been republished in mid-2017 under a non-commercial license under Microsoft\u0027s \"Game Content Usage Rules\" by an independent group of developers and can be played for free on a server emulator known as :Project Celeste\" with all online features fully enabled. The team uses Microsoft\u0027s publicly released development-kit to balance, fix bugs, and expand the content where Microsoft\u0027s team left off.  \n  \nThe team behind Project Celeste have unveiled a total of 15 Player Vs. Player (Champion mode) rebalance patches, along with several questpacks. The latest, Realms of The World, features a whole new city and quest hub to visit. There has also been a handful of patches for the civilizations in PvE, and countless changes to maps and map consistency in both game modes. The community of Project Celeste feature many of the notable members of earlier-era AOEO Player Vs Player scene, as well as a few members of the competitive starcraft II scene. \n \nThe game can be played for free in single-player and multiplayer mode with all online features fully enabled. In May 2019, the team announced that they are developing Microsoft\u0027s unreleased Roman civilization for play based upon all known data of the civilization before the official servers were closed.

Several players can form tennis clubs ( guilds ) for which a battle function ( raid) is being planned. In addition, the property values ​​can be increased by using special items of clothing, each with extra capabilities. These are available in the item shop and can be paid for using either the cash currency alaplaya Points (AP) or the in-game currency gold. Popular items included the speaker, which the game falsely described as an improved version of itself, the Wing of Memory, for which the player spent AP every month to reset their stats, or the so-called gachas, a more expensive variant, to to get to QS. The game itself takes place in the parallel world FantasyLand and takes place on different courts wie Nest Of Rubycrab, Twinkle Town, Snow Moon, Life Woods, Emerald Beach, Arena, Deva Berg oder Atlantis statt.",

This version was a revision of The House of the Dead III, and has only been released in Japan and only for PC as of 2008. While the latter is a standard light gun shooter, Typing replaces the gun with the keyboard. The game is an educational game, as it requires players to enhance their typing skills to be successful.

As the game advances further into the dungeon, you will gather Runes, which will be used to combine into 285 unique spells. Discovering new spells will unlock their entries in your Runedex; unlock them all! But be careful – if you die, your playthrough is finished.\n\nWe wanted to make a game that had a lot of replayability, customization, and discovery. Almost every design choice we made focused on furthering those three goals. We want the player to be able to choose the playing style that suits them: long range sniper, mid range run and gun, or an up close brawler. There are many features to facilitate this level of customization. When you earn enough experience you will level up and be able to choose from 4 random traits to make you even stronger.\n\nEach floor is procedurally generated, so the enemies, rooms, event rooms, and bosses you face are all randomly chosen, making every playthrough different. You will not encounter everything in the game in one playthrough, or even five: there is always something new to encounter.",

Players control Seymour, a small potato-like creature who wishes to be a film star. The film\u0027s script has been locked in a safe, meaning Seymour must solve puzzles by collecting and using objects scattered throughout the game in order to progress, ultimately retrieving the script and allowing filming to start.\nThe game was originally designed as part of the Dizzy series, with a working title of Movieland Dizzy, but the creators of Dizzy disagreed with the real-world direction the game had taken, despite it being 90% complete. The developers, Big Red Software, were given 12 weeks to create a new game with a different character. Seymour was adapted from Dizzy, with a new shape and fingers to differentiate the two.\nSeymour Goes to Hollywood received both positive and average ratings from the video game press at the time, and was compared to Dizzy video games both positively and negatively. The character also received both praise and criticism for his shape.",

    "summary": "Lead your Ant Colony to Dominance! \n \nEmpires of the Undergrowth is an ant colony management game, in a fast-paced real-time strategy style. The player excavates their nest underground, constructing tunnels and chambers to store food and raise brood. On the surface, the ants claim territory, gather resources, overwhelm fearsome arachnids and clash with other colonies. Nest design, army size, composition and attack timing are key to securing victory. \n \nMissions are narrated from the perspective of a documentary film maker studying the ants, who offers intelligent insight into the goings-on of the colony and the undergrowth beyond. The primary game mode in early access is Formicarium, where you take ownership of a home colony of unique DNA-harvesting ants as they work to assimilate the desirable traits of their foes. You can upgrade them by playing one-off missions, sometimes with your home colony and sometimes with other ant species.",
