    "summary": "uDraw Pictionary is an art-based video game developed by Page 44 Studios and published by THQ Inc. that players can play on the uDraw GameTablet for the Nintendo Wii. The game is based on the popular board game Pictionary, in which players draw pictures based on clues from a subject and have their teammates guess what specific words the picture is supposed to represent. It was released on November 14, 2010 for the Nintendo Wii game system.\n\nDesigned as a multi-player game or party game for all ages, players can choose teams of up to four people to play. Since the uDraw GameTablet comes bundled with uDraw Studio, another art-based video game, players can familiarize themselves with how the tablet and stylus pen work before playing, as well as how to draw, color and sketch on the tablet. uDraw Pictionary includes more than 3,000 clues, with traditional Adult Clues like Object, Difficult and Action or Junior Clues like “Animal Houses” and “At the Zoo” for younger players. The game differs somewhat from classic Pictionary, as the video game has new draw modes. The normal Pictionary mode lets users play the game show-style on a 3D game board with a variety of drawing tools, brushes and colors to choose from for a livelier sketching experience. Pictionary Mania has a custom game board and seven new draw modes, including Get It Straight, Shape It Up, Rotation Frustration, One Line, Ink Limit, No Peeking and Off Hand. Free Draw lets players use the drawing tools in the uDraw GameTablet to create works of art.",

It appears that they are all coming from one central point that is controlled by a mysterious stranger. The player controls a group of heroes in this role-playing game as he tries to find out the origins of the drug and to break down on the man who is responsible for them. \n \nSpirit of Adventure allows the player to create his/her own party, choosing between various character classes, including traditional fighters and priests, but also less common classes such as Goddess or Banshee. Characters have three main parameters; body, mind, and magic, as well as strength, dexterity, IQ, and charisma. Controlling a party of up to six combatants, the player has to accept quests, explore towns, and battle enemies to advance the story.",

Back to that flat expanse, that seemingly endless sea of rustling cornstalks peppered by rusty silos and rustier towns. A typically intense Midwestern storm is approaching while Kelly is out; she needs to get home.\n\nThree Fourths Home is a visual short story in which you assume the role of Kelly during her drive through the storm. In the 20 miles between her grandparents\u0027 crumbling barn and her parents\u0027 home, she receives a phone call from her mother. While driving through a stylized representation of rural Nebraska, you must navigate an extended conversation between Kelly and her parents and younger brother.\n\nThree Fourths Home takes a look into a specific moment of these characters\u0027 lives and their relationships with one another. The narrative touches on a variety of issues affecting Kelly and her family, including disability, adulthood, and familial obligation.\n\nAs a visual short story, dialogue choice is the primary focus of Three Fourths Home. Between the main game and the epilogue, nearly 800 unique dialogue choices shade the story differently based on how you play. In addition to dialogue choice, you must also keep driving in order to keep the conversation going. Stop, and time slows to a crawl. Kelly has to move forward in order to get home.",

    "summary": "Nirvana X-ROM is the companion game to the Italian SciFi film Nirvana directed by Gabriele Salvatores. It is set after the events of the film: VR game developer Jimi Dini has wiped the source code of his latest game Nirvana, thus releasing its protagonist Solo from his virtual prison. However, portions of the game still survive in Jimi\u0027s archives, creating a potential risk of Nirvana being re-assembled. The player is called upon to investigate Jimi\u0027s house and archives in search for the lingering game code and destroy it. \n \nThe gameplay is a mixture of puzzle-solving and exploration viewed from the player\u0027s perspective. The location view can be freely rotated by moving the mouse and several objects are clickable, often giving access to secret rooms. The bottom bar icons offer several actions such as using scanners, connecting to the network and communicating with the artificial intelligence that powers Jimi\u0027s house. Many solutions to the puzzles are found by sifting through Jimi\u0027s archives, which contain audio, images and clips from the film, as well as program code and other digital objects"

    "summary": "This game is the second volume of a series of compilations of MSX computer games released by Konami only in Japan. It was also released on the Sega Saturn. \n \nThis compilation includes the classic games: \n \n- Konami\u0027s Golf (1984): \nKonami\u0027s Golf features a challenging 18 hole course and allows you to choose your club, adjust your stance and control your swing, applying hook and slice if desired (or inadvertently added). Wind and ball lie must be taken into account. The game features a split screen with two views, one an overhead view of the entire hole, and the other a 3-D view from your balls current location. The gameplay options include 1 player stroke play, 2 player stroke play, or 2 player match play. \n \n- Konami\u0027s Billiards (1983): \nBilliards is a pool simulations game. Pocket ball, one of the most famous versions of billiards in the world, is now available on your computer screen. Discover the excitement of balls colliding, the silence and concentration of the billiard room. This game has a dual player mode. \n \n- Hyper Sports 3 (1985): \nFour new challenging sports events await in this third and last installment of the Hyper Sports series. The sports to play in this edition are cycling, the triple jump, curling and pole jumping. To continue to the next event you must complete each event within the events qualification criteria. \n \n- Athletic Land (1984): \nYou play a child on a metro-cross-like dash across an obstacle course with a time limit. Your physical prowess is tested to the limit as you leap, duck, turn and twist to avoid all hazards. There are several screens with different combinations of obstacles. \n \n- Magical Tree (1984): \nMagical Tree is a platform game where the player\u0027s objective is to reach the tree\u0027s top, some 2,000 meters above the ground. You play the little indian and you have to avoid several enemies, like bees and owls while climbing towards the top of the tree. Collect fruits and special items as diamonds on your way to the top of the tree. \n \n- Yie Ar Kung-Fu II: \nThe Emperor Yie-Gah (1985): Sequel of the popular arcade game, Yie Ar Kung-Fu. It follows Oolong\u0027s quest to become a Kung-Fu master. This involves fighting with a wide range of opponents in a traditional one-on-one 2D environment. Oolong has a wide range of attack moves he can use to lower his opponent\u0027s life bar, including traditional punching and kicking attacks as well as jumping ones. Opponents are well equipped with unique weapons and attacks. \n \n- Knightmare (1986): \nThe game is about brave knight, who shoots with arrows all his enemies and at the end of level their bosses such like witches, etc. Shooting monsters, avoiding obstacles, passing the bridges and collecting upgrades for your weapon leads you to the glory. Digitized music and sound adds more to ordinary arcade gameplay. This game maybe also about two brave knights (you and your friend) who does the same for the victory on one screen. \n \n- Super Cobra (1983): \nSuper Cobra is a side scrolling shooter based on the arcade game. You\u0027re a chopper pilot on a surveillance mission in enemy territory; your goal is to make it through the various obstacle courses alive and score as many points as possible. Tall buildings, mountains, narrow tunnels, and various enemies (such as tanks, rockets, mines, and more) can all get in the way and destroy your chopper if you aren\u0027t careful. To help defend yourself, the chopper is armed with a machine gun and bombs which can be used to destroy the enemy tanks and rockets. To make the task more difficult, your chopper has a limited amount of fuel. Throughout the landscapes are fuel tanks; if one of these is shot or bombed, you will be awarded extra fuel. As the levels progress, the enemies become more aggressive, fuel becomes more scarce, and the landscape becomes trickier to navigate. \n \n- TwinBee (1986): \n(aka Stinger) Save Professor Cinnamon! When aliens from the planet Attackon kidnap the inventor during their invasion of Earth, two Twinbee Stinger jets (armed with boxing gloves) are unleashed to rescue Cinnamon before the aliens turn the Earth into a giant ball of cotton candy! In this vertical and horizontal scrolling shooter, blast away unusual creatures and even more bizarre bosses, while collecting power-ups and super weapons. By repeatedly shooting bells that come out of the clouds, these bells will change colors, each color giving a different ability. Getting shot down releases a ghost of Stinger, which can be recollected to gain the jet\u0027s powers back. In the two-player mode, Twinbee (cyan craft) and Winbee (red craft) have the same speed and they can join \"hand-to-hand\" and fire a super blast. Also in two player mode, if one craft is hit by the other from behind, it will fire four multi-directional shots. \n \n- Gradius 2 (1987): \nGradius 2 is a side scrolling shoot \u0027m up. Shooting enemies will leave a power up pod behind which can be collected to add more power to your space ship. Every level features a wide variety of enemies trying to stop you, with a large boss at the end. Gameplay is for one player or two players alternating.",

Back to that flat expanse, that seemingly endless sea of rustling cornstalks peppered by rusty silos and rustier towns. A typically intense Midwestern storm is approaching while Kelly is out; she needs to get home.\n\nThree Fourths Home is a visual short story in which you assume the role of Kelly during her drive through the storm. In the 20 miles between her grandparents\u0027 crumbling barn and her parents\u0027 home, she receives a phone call from her mother. While driving through a stylized representation of rural Nebraska, you must navigate an extended conversation between Kelly and her parents and younger brother.\n\nThree Fourths Home takes a look into a specific moment of these characters\u0027 lives and their relationships with one another. The narrative touches on a variety of issues affecting Kelly and her family, including disability, adulthood, and familial obligation.",

    "summary": "Step into the sturdy boots of McJagger and take on an army of the undead! In the standalone spin-off to All Zombies Must Die!, the only thing that really matters is your score. Build your multiplier and rack up as many kills as possible to become the most fearsome zombie-slayer in Deadhill. To that end, the fact remains the same: all zombies must die.\n\nAs well infesting familiar locations such as Town Square, Shopping Mall and Surburbia, the undead have ambled their way into all new areas of Deadhill: the Military Base and Graveyard. McJagger will also have to deal with three new flavours of zombie: Soldier, Necro and Ghost. Our stoic hero shouldn’t be too concerned, however, there are two new weapons to help send the shufflers packing: Mini-gun and Rocket Launcher. Boom!\n\nYour score is based on a combination of two multipliers, one of which increases as you complete quests that appear organically as you play, and the other based on how many environmental modifiers you’ve managed to apply to the undead. Use fire, shock, sonic and radiation – and the environments themselves - to your full advantage, and send that score soaring!",

The fate of the world hangs by a thread, and a few ticks of the clock means the difference between justice and annihilation. WINBACK 2 brings to the series a new \"route\" system that lets players experience each mission from the perspective of different operatives. There are 30 intense missions, multiple difficulty levels, and new weapons including the highly-anticipated sniper rifle. The new Winback assault team is comprised of three young, yet combat-proven operatives led by Craig Contrell. Each team member is qualified in six different weapon types and highly-adept at CQB (Close Quarter Battle). They are masters of target identification, engagement and shot placement. In the hands of the player, all of these techniques will be put to the test. The game\u0027s unique shooting action is spread across 30 high-risk operations situated in challenging urban environments and conveyances.",

The majority of the human race is now known as “zomborgs,” which has placed the survivors in ceaseless fights to the death with one another because that’s just how these games work.\n\nThe game is played from a third-person perspective with a large focus on mobility, as characters boost around with jetpacks. There’s also a healthy dose of vehicles they can drive around, plus a crafting system. One interesting feature is that players are rewarded with building materials after each match that they can use to construct refuges, which are places to hang out with friends in-between matches.",

    "summary": "Like the original Salamander, and as opposed to the Life Force releases, Salamander 2 abandons the selection-bar based power-up system, in favor for a simplified system that focuses on powering weapons up based on specific icons. For example, the player cannot increase his ship speed until a speed icon is picked up; additional speed icons further increase the ship velocity.\n\nSeveral weapons, when additionally upgraded, turn into a \u0027super\u0027 weapon for approximately ten seconds. If the player has the ripple laser, and then gets another icon for it, the player will receive the high-powered Buster ripple for a short period of time. Options have been slightly changed with the arrival of \u0027option seeds\u0027, which are small options that orbit the ship firing only the basic initial shot. Two option seeds can combine into one full option. Moreover, options can also be sacrificed to utilize a short-term homing beam weapon.\n\nSeveral enemy bosses typical to Gradius games return, including the Brain Golem (the first level boss) and the Tetran (the second level boss). There are a total of six levels. Since the game is similar to its prequel, Salamander 2 does not use the Revival Start feature from Gradius (which pushes the player back to a pre-determined checkpoint if a life is lost), many people consider this title to be easier than other titles in the Gradius series due to this. Once the game has been completed, it starts its second-loop at a much higher difficulty. The music is also changed to remixed versions of Salamander\u0027s music in some stages. The first player\u0027s ship is called Vic Viper while the second player\u0027s ship is Super Cobra.",

The adventure takes you through a variety of different environments and levels that continually change up gameplay. Donkey Kong Country also provides plenty of opportunities for exploration with almost every level having a multitude of collectible, shortcuts, and hidden bonus areas.",

    "summary": "We\u0027re excited about the release of Falcon BMS and hope that it will help revive the Falcon 4.0 community. We\u0027ve put years of time and effort into this release and hope you enjoy it. \n \nWhat is Falcon 4.0? \n \nIf you\u0027re new to Falcon 4.0, (\"F4\" for short), F4 is a combat flight simulator originally developed and released December 12, 1998 by MicroProse. It models the Lockheed-Martin F-16C Block 50/52 in a full-scale war on the Korean Peninsula. F4 has been popular among combat sim pilots due to its dynamic war campaign engine, detailed aircraft avionics, and multi-player capabilities. Continual development of the simulation by community members has allowed F4 to live on years after the MicroProse studios were shut down and official development of the sim ceased. \n \nWho are we? \n \nBenchmark Sims is one of the few remaining F4 development groups comprised of \"community members\". Our first beta release for an F4 mod was in September of 2003. We\u0027ve done our best to add still more improvements to F4 in the meanwhile. \"Falcon BMS\" is now the official name of our community mod for the original Falcon 4.0. \n \nWhat have we accomplished? \n \nBMS has worked on an array of features and our goal with the articles is to try and bring back that same excitement the old MicroProse developer\u0027s notes gave us all years ago. We could just say something like \"we\u0027ve coded a new flight model\" but without any documentation, there would be no appreciation as to just how difficult it was, how long it took to get right, or how detailed it is. We think some of our features will make your jaw drop--it does ours! Some of those features include: \n \nGraphics \n3d cockpit \nTerrain engine \nMulti-player code improvements \nFlight modeling and physics \nArtificial Intelligence \nAvionics \nSound engine \nUser Interface \nAirbase modeling \nWeather modeling \n \nAnd more! \n \n-The Benchmark Sims Team",

    "summary": "Street Fighter II\u0027: Champion Edition is a competitive fighting game released for the arcades by Capcom in 1992. It was the first of several updated versions of the original Street Fighter II: The World Warrior. The main changes consisted of the addition of the Grand Masters (the final four computer-controlled opponents in the single-player mode) as playable characters and mirror matches (same character vs. matches). The fighting techniques of the eight main characters from the original game were also further refined to allowed for more balanced competitive play.\n\nis the first update to the game. The four boss characters from the first edition became selectable characters and a feature was added that allowed two players to select the same character, with one character being distinguished from the other with an alternate color scheme. Characters using their alternate color scheme have their names printed in blue below their lifebar. The number of opponents in the single-player mode increased to twelve due to the addition of clone matches. Some of the artwork was redrawn as well and the stages\u0027 backgrounds were recolored. Much of the gameplay was revised to balance the characters out. From this edition onward, the maximum number of rounds was reduced to four.\n\nChampion Edition (as well as The World Warrior) is known for being the target of a number of illegally sold hacks due to its popularity. One in particular is Street Fighter II: Rainbow Edition.\nChampion Edition was followed by Street Fighter II\u0027 Turbo: Hyper Fighting, released several months later.",

In Race mode you simply have to finish a track in the fastest possible time. Each track has a predefined track record set by the programmers. There\u0027s a bronze, silver and gold medal time, which the player has to beat to earn those medals. In Stunt mode the tracks have a more acrobatic nature, and you have to finish them with as few restarts as possible. In Puzzle mode the player has to build a track connecting the fixed starting and finishing points using certain track blocks and then drive the track in the fastest time possible.",
