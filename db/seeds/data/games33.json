Without just one of those, you'll die several times.\n\nThis is the mod for everyone who craves (or simply wants) a hardcore version of brutal doom since it brings the intensity of Brutal Doom up to a 10 on a 1 point scale of badassery. If Project Brutality is like Brutal Doom on steroids, this version is like Brutal Doom on speed and crack cocaine.\n\nMonsters are up to an extreme level of relentlessness. For instance, the zombies are more accurate, have faster fire rates, and fire faster tracers. Imps can throw up to four fireballs in a single charge and they have a flamethrower attack for close range combat, their balls also scorch the ground for a maximum insult to injury.\n\nBarons and knights can sprint and jump at you, often reaching you sooner than you could imagine, and Barons can throw small BFG rounds at you. Archviles can summon monsters very fast and their fire-rape leaves continuous flames on the ground. I'll leave the Cyberdemons and Masterminds to your imagination since what they do is not pretty at all.\n\nThe good news is that the player is given many advantages. Unlike BD Redemption, where Doomguy is weakened to reality, both Doomguy and his enemies are tougher. Doomguy's attacks very efficiently with fast reloading, punching, shooting, and the assistance of an item store.\n\nSome new weapons include the pistol, SMG, Auto-Shotgun, sniper-rifle, Dual-Chainsaws, and Cyberdemon's Rocket launcher (which is only available in the Heavy weapon class). Many weapons have a new tertiary fire; like adjusting the sniper scope, malt-rounds for the minigun, Rocket launcher grenade mode, and the dual wielding function was moved to the tertiary fire mode.","videos":[{"id":67526,"video_id":"qpxtZBUst9o"}]},{"id":133927,"cover":{"id":101222,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co263q.jpg"},"name":"Bad Dream: Hospital","platforms":[{"id":6,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}],"screenshots":[{"id":384238,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc88ha.jpg"},{"id":384239,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc88hb.jpg"}],"summary":"Bad Dream: Hospital is a third game in Bad Dream series.

It was written by Patricia Fogleman and Michael Berlyn and was the first in the \"Tales of Adventure\" line. Due to Infocom's virtual Z-Machine, it was ported to a wide variety of popular computing systems of the day, including the Apple II and Commodore 64. It is Infocom's tenth game.\n\nIn 1916, Dr. Ellington came into possession of a 5000-year-old fragment of pottery covered with hieroglyphics. (Conveniently for the text-only game, these runes look strangely like ASCII characters.) After years of painstaking research, Ellington managed to decipher a portion of the text, which indicated the general location of a pyramid that no one had heard of before. He managed to organize a modest expedition to the area in 1920, but found nothing before he died except a small block of limestone bearing the same style of hieroglyphics. According to the partial translation he made, the new fragment spoke of a queen and great riches. When Howard Carter discovered King Tut's tomb a few years later, Dr. Ellington's widow figured that someone had found the pyramid her husband had been looking for. She stowed the papers and artifacts away and forgot all about them. Rose found them in the early 1980s after her mother's death and did some preliminary fact-checking. The pyramid indicated by her father's papers is nowhere near Tut's. In fact, no pyramids have ever been discovered in the area Dr. Ellington was investigating. Rose is by no means a rich woman—she only wants someone to give her father the recognition he deserves—so it'll be a modest expedition. But it sure sounds like the perfect chance for an opportunistic soldier-of-fortune to make a name for himself.","tags":[43,268435487,536871130,536871277,536871939,536872050,536873308,536875172,536884867,536885978]},{"id":68075,"cover":{"id":96185,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co227t.jpg"},"name":"Mario Clock","platforms":[{"id":159,"name":"Nintendo DSi"}],"screenshots":[{"id":164434,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/bh5vd6qsd8eu6mfqdjiy.jpg"},{"id":164435,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sp3yjzsnvec3pw0xaikk.jpg"},{"id":164436,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/ktqdwrfcn4p7bdwdmsdy.jpg"}],"summary":"A Mario-themed clock for your DSi.

When you play Samsara, you pick a hero from a classic FPS game, spawn in the battlefield with abilities and weapons from their original game, and then proceed to lay waste among all those that stand in your way in whatever iwad or levelset of your choice. Each of the heroes are strictly limited to their own weapons, so you won't have a nonsensical random mash-up of people wielding weapons just not suited for them.\nWant to play in Heretic? No problem. Give Chex Quest a whirl? Go right ahead. Wanted to like HeXen but didn't like the low amount of weapons? Go on, enjoy it. Want to go strictly vanilla and play Doom II? Be my guest. Current iwads supported are Doom, Doom II/TNT/Plutonia, Heretic, HeXen, Chex Quest, Strife, and Harmony, and more are to come.\n\nThe goal of Samsara is threefold:\n1: To provide an interesting competitive mod that will enhance, rather than break, deathmatch/capture the flag/etc play. While obviously nothing will match pure vanilla for srs tourney play, if desired one can have a match full of Doomguys and have little to no differences from vanilla play--and someone joining in as Corvus should not dramatically change things.\n2: To stay true to the spirit of classic FPSes by presenting these characters with as close to their original abilities and weapons as reasonably possible. Playing with them should be very much like playing their original game.\n3: To provide a fun experience complimentary with many other levelsets, be they cooperative or competitive, so that people can live as their favorite heroes once again and put them through wringers so many other inventive people have designed. Other heroes should not differ so drastically from Doom II that other mods would now be unplayable.\n\nWhether you play in co-op and tear through endless hordes of monsters or play in deathmatch and tear through whatever friends or enemies challenge you, Samsara offers you the ability to live through your favorite games again on new battlefields or new iwads entirely.","tags":[1,268435461,536871219,536871987,536897408,536897524],"videos":[{"id":45122,"video_id":"trgQYIJVHNI"}]},{"id":166549,"cover":{"id":175852,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co3ros.jpg"},"name":"Daisenryaku: Players's Spirit","platforms":[{"id":7,"name":"PlayStation"}]},{"id":143353,"cover":{"id":130444,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co2sng.jpg"},"name":"A buggy Adventure","platforms":[{"id":6,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"},{"id":34,"name":"Android"}],"screenshots":[{"id":421525,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc9191.jpg"}],"summary":"A game about a ghost, which has to avoid spikes by moving up, down and using bugs.","tags":[268435488,536872617,536873300]},{"id":30701,"cover":{"id":35678,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/lksv6fsauzw7uns4mcch.jpg"},"name":"Fiber Twig: Midnight Puzzle","platforms":[{"id":6,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}],"screenshots":[{"id":73399,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/dh0xdrvxkcldrsvvonml.jpg"},{"id":73400,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/vk1b7yw1g8ujngtage2d.jpg"},{"id":73401,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/lh78zyr1ichrgbr1guro.jpg"},{"id":73402,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/rlgws5xbww5b75tmvqse.jpg"},{"id":73403,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/tpopiacxojfxkiek8tg5.jpg"}],"summary":"Get into the midnight mood — build networks of light streams and neon lamps!","tags":[268435465,268435488,536873787]},{"id":35782,"name":"Incognito","platforms":[{"id":6,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}],"screenshots":[{"id":88338,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/pyogdosyvswztuq3pe2w.jpg"},{"id":88339,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/tnblpzklm7yhuwpioueh.jpg"},{"id":88340,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/axrqryargzt41zu0ipvy.jpg"},{"id":88341,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/rp5zuxqdpzmj691fqlmj.jpg"},{"id":88342,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/fxzhcmuluyvsgpacag94.jpg"}],"summary":"An indie game like no other.

The game is mainly the work of Paul Cuisset (programming) and Jean Baudlot (sound).\n\nThe game was released with the Bond license in the United States, although this led to some inconsistencies as the MI6 agent appeared to be taking his orders from the CIA.\n\nThe Stealth Affair mainly features a point-and-click style of gameplay reminiscent of many of the LucasArts adventures of the time, as well as a number of more action-oriented elements including an overhead viewed maze section and a scene in which Glames/Bond attempts to escape from an underwater cavern before he runs out of oxygen.\n\nThe cracked Amiga version of the game featured a primitive synthesized voice that would perform all the dialogue in the game if 1MB or more RAM was installed. Unfortunately the crack featured a bug which meant that if the player attempted to click the mouse button in order to skip through the speech faster the game would freeze and have to be rebooted. For this reason many seasoned players would actually remove the memory expansion before playing the game for any extended period of time.","tags":[1,23,268435465,268435487,536870952,536871044,536871109,536871115,536871127,536871939,536871991,536872179,536875054,536875294,536876381,536876694,536879693]},{"id":98773,"name":"WW Fantasy","platforms":[{"id":6,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}],"screenshots":[{"id":233016,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/xx6k1o66g0ne7pjdzoj7.jpg"},{"id":233017,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/tifn0naohedqll9dkh4y.jpg"},{"id":233018,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/iq616awiv7oc2gnkhrnm.jpg"},{"id":233020,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/s4lfsdp1wuocpb7bb35j.jpg"},{"id":233021,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/a0u4tw2iftsiiake4znh.jpg"},{"id":233022,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/wy0kaayhv0axb7l60sb2.jpg"},{"id":233023,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/eke1ivvj6dobqzxzy6rd.jpg"},{"id":233024,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/rddge4orxt8ixlyvlgwf.jpg"},{"id":233025,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/ryy5s52cx1dor0qogybk.jpg"}],"summary":"in this game, the player is a hacker, get the command, to return to the headquarters to perform the task, nowwe must separate from our present friends, what's going to be interesting on the way?","tags":[1,268435468,268435469,268435487,268435488]},{"id":143525,"cover":{"id":131251,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co2t9v.jpg"},"name":"Beholder's Lair","platforms":[{"id":6,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}],"screenshots":[{"id":422389,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc91x1.jpg"},{"id":422390,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc91x2.jpg"},{"id":422391,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc91x3.jpg"},{"id":422392,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc91x4.jpg"},{"id":422393,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc91x5.jpg"},{"id":422394,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc91x6.jpg"},{"id":422395,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc91x7.jpg"},{"id":422396,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc91x8.jpg"},{"id":422397,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc91x9.jpg"}],"summary":"Beholder's Lair is a difficult 2D platformer that revolves around skillfully avoiding different kinds of enemies.
