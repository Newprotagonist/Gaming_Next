Your task is to find the source of ancient Power and uncover the secrets of the Labyrinth.    \n    \nRandom generation    \nOur game has inherited random generation of the game world from the \"roguelikes\", i.e. the look and content of the Labyrinth will be unique in each new game: floors maps, monsters, treasures and hiding places, and even properties of found and created objects will be randomly generated by you. Each time you'll get a unique experience and find new ways to your goal.    \nSuch unusual behavior of the Labyrinth is justified by the plot - it was created by the Ancients, the ancestor of the vampires’ genus who turned it to his hiding place in a real trap for intruders.    \nThe mines of precious gems and prison catacombs, deserted caves and ancient treasuries – one can hardly understand what the Labyrinth was before it was liked by the Ancient, so many things are mixed in it ...    \n    \n«Vampire» improvement    \nVampire skills (19 unique skills for each of 3 characters) and their improvement is tied to the blood power received by your character from murdered enemies. You may use valuable points to open the \"Reinforced vampirism\" or improve the \"Cleave\" tested by time and fallen enemies? Or, to reserve and use them for a powerful \"Bloody madness\" when being desperate?

A version was released in 1990 for the Game Boy in Japan and in 1991 in Europe and North America, which included the Four Player Adapter for four player gameplay.\n--------------------------------\nThe game features racing in one of two Formula One cars around a variety of tracks near world capitals and landmarks. In the Family Computer version of the game, the cars come in three colors: red, light orange, and dark blue.\n\nGameplay is similar to that of Namco's Pole Position. Finishing in first, second, or third results in a podium finish; players must win on each track to advance to the next. Vehicles in the game have a generic two-speed manual transmission governing their speed (with a \"LOW\" setting and a \"HI\" setting). There are ten tracks in the race; the game repeats itself after the conclusion of the tenth circuit. Three difficult levels help beginners to adjust to the artificial intelligence on \"skill level 1\" while novices get some extra challenge on \"skill level 2\" and experts get the ultimate challenge on \"skill level 3. A strict time limit forces players to finish races without mistakes in order to progress to a more complicated race track.\n\nSeveral Nintendo characters appear at the end of race circuits: Mario, Luigi, Princess Peach, Toad, Bowser, Link, Samus, Pit and Donkey Kong. The game resulted in a Grand Prix series sequel, featuring Famicom Grand Prix: F-1 Race and Famicom Grand Prix II: 3D Hot Rally. Similar to the original, both games were never released outside of Japan.","tags":[268435466,536871067,536871396,536871532,536872652,536872653,536872654,536872655,536872656,536872695,536872810,536874337,536875069,536875117,536875282,536875322,536875955,536876102,536876779,536878319,536880441]},{"id":8725,"aggregated_rating":80.0,"cover":{"id":9218,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/t5be0eiz8alniz4xdeed.jpg"},"name":"Continue?9876543210","platforms":[{"id":3,"name":"Linux"},{"id":6,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"},{"id":14,"name":"Mac"},{"id":39,"name":"iOS"}],"screenshots":[{"id":8411,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/bjbfuyrsz9getyveyemq.jpg"},{"id":8412,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/odsledlrts7dk3afrhoo.jpg"},{"id":8413,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/ievrxdmyegu3ivz3smxh.jpg"},{"id":8414,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/yeq6bwicxqbjtrace3vf.jpg"},{"id":8415,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/kw3ewannwfit6rqhysdj.jpg"}],"summary":"Continue?9876543210 is an artsy, philosophical, action game for IOS devices, MAC, PC, & LINUX.\nContinue? was inspired by existential road trips into nowhere, Peruvian jungle drugs, and a brush with death while lost in the mountains of New Mexico.

According to Valve it is meant to bridge the gap between No Mercy and Death Toll. Crash Course is the shortest of any Left 4 Dead campaign and contains only two chapters.\n\nCrash Course begins shortly after the events of No Mercy. The helicopter rescue pilot from the Rooftop Finale succumbs to the Infection and Zoey shoots him in mid-flight. The helicopter crashes in an industrial area outside of the city of Fairfield in Whitney County.\n\nStarting from next to the helicopter crash site, the Survivors traverse Fairfield's industrial landscape. Initially there is no firm clue about their destination until they make reference to a truck depot and discuss the town of Riverside where a military evacuation center is reported to be. This plan obviously foreshadows and contextualizes the Death Toll campaign.\n\nAt the truck depot they discover an armored truck mounted on a workshop hoist which must be lowered before they can board and escape. Activating a generator for this purpose triggers a finale horde attack. In another act of foreshadowing, the generator stalls partway through the battle and one survivor must run out and restart it: the same problem occurs in The Sacrifice except the survivor who volunteers is certain to die."},{"id":148243,"cover":{"id":155908,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co3cas.jpg"},"name":"The Falconeer: The Hunter","platforms":[{"id":6,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"},{"id":48,"name":"PlayStation 4"},{"id":130,"name":"Nintendo Switch"}],"screenshots":[{"id":503603,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scaskz.jpg"},{"id":503604,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scasl0.jpg"},{"id":503605,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scasl1.jpg"},{"id":503606,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scasl2.jpg"},{"id":503607,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scasl3.jpg"},{"id":503608,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scasl4.jpg"},{"id":503609,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scasl5.jpg"}],"summary":"Take to the skies aboard a feathered serpent and unleash fiery vengeance from above with The Hunter content pack.

Featuring three complete games, Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty, Metal Gear Solid: Snake Eater and Metal Gear Solid: Peace Walker, the HD Collection offers old and new fans a chance to experience the epic game play, design and storytelling of the MGS franchise. The \"Metal Gear Solid (MGS)\" series is the seminal work of Hideo Kojima, Japan's master game creator, and the progenitor of the stealth action game genre. The series has become a global phenomenon, with over 27 million copies sold worldwide. The player controls a secret agent from an elite special forces unit who is sent on solo sneaking missions through enemy installations, vast jungles, and sometimes even the thick of battle. Alone and surrounded by the enemy, even a special forces agent will find it tough to come out alive. But that is the secret behind the series' popularity-the cerebral challenge of figuring out how to avoid combat, and the thrill of sneaking through enemy territory undetected.The MGS series is also known for its storyline, which blends seamlessly with the gameplay. The scenarios are based on extensive research and incorporate the drama of actual developments in society. These elements have made MGS what it is today: a mature work of entertainment that transcends national borders and the confines of video games, and one of the leading products of the Japanese content business.","tags":[1,23,268435471,268435480,268435487,536871475,536871784,536871872,536871945,536872131,536872349,536872451,536872746,536873507,536875194,536875250,536875487,536875638,536875707,536875830,536876068,536876096,536876167,536876219,536876235,536876574,536876970,536877015,536877151,536877252,536877297,536877598,536877986,536878097,536878380,536878502,536878520,536878563,536879212,536879716,536879908,536880235,536880241,536880251,536880714,536880759,536880880,536881267,536882018,536882053,536882445,536892033,536892034],"videos":[{"id":14177,"video_id":"1K_l8U61OpA"}]},{"id":143776,"cover":{"id":132051,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co2tw3.jpg"},"name":"Find Yourself","platforms":[{"id":6,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}],"screenshots":[{"id":498631,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scaoqv.jpg"},{"id":498632,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scaoqw.jpg"},{"id":498633,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scaoqx.jpg"},{"id":498634,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scaoqy.jpg"},{"id":498638,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scaor2.jpg"},{"id":498640,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scaor4.jpg"},{"id":498643,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scaor7.jpg"},{"id":498648,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scaorc.jpg"},{"id":498649,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scaord.jpg"},{"id":498651,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scaorf.jpg"},{"id":498653,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scaorh.jpg"},{"id":498654,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scaori.jpg"},{"id":498655,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scaorj.jpg"},{"id":498656,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scaork.jpg"},{"id":498657,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scaorl.jpg"},{"id":498658,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scaorm.jpg"}],"summary":"The game \"Find Yourself\" - psychological horror from the first person in a closed space.
