It can be played solo, with two-players via the Game Link Cable, or with three or four players via the Four Player Adapter. The game features 24 different tracks of increasing difficulty, and the object is to finish in the top three in order to qualify to race in the next track. Players who do not finish in the top three may use a continue and retry the track; players get three continues, and the game ends when the player fails to finish in the top three and has no continues remaining. \nEach track is different and range from standard ovals to tracks with many twists and turns. The game includes many obstacles, such as oil slicks that send players spinning, puddles of water that cause players to slide out of control, sand traps and \"slow cones\" that slow players down, large cones that bring players to a complete halt, and walls of tires that players bounce off. If a player hits an oil slick and then hits a wall while spinning, the player\u0027s car is temporarily destroyed, which loses time. The tracks also has items that help players along the way: \"zippers\" (a series of chevrons on the track) give players a speed boost, roll cages allow players to hit walls without being destroyed and allow them to crash opponents by forcing them into walls, and missiles and bombs temporarily destroy opponents\u0027 cars. Also on the track are spare parts which help improve performance—tires improve traction, batteries increase acceleration, and engines improve speed. \nPlayers have the opportunity to upgrade their vehicles by collecting letters, which are distributed throughout the tracks. By spelling \"Nintendo\" with the letters, players upgrade to a better vehicle; players can upgrade from the \"Racer\" to the \"Speed demon\" and then to the Spiker, each of which performs progressively better than the previous vehicle. If players spell \"Nintendo\" while racing with the Spiker, then they win the game.",

They should be in the afterlife, however they started to hurt good people badly. Dead people also remained in this world with their spirits so that they committed big crimes such as murdering and looting in this confusion. This routine trapped in vicious cycle \n \nSon of Heaven, Yangak \nYangak was a monk as great master Taehwa’s pupil before who was getting treated as an eligible person. Unfortunately, Samuk was Taehwa’s preference so that Yangak was unsatisfied with his master’s opinion. By that time, Yangak became a leader by force of arms among the warriors. When many eunuchs were gathering to dethrone the Emperor, suddenly they started to follow Yang ak such as an emphatic one. Because of this situation, he decided to kill the Emperor and his followers that he could hold the first place. \n \nGreat Master, Taehwa \nIt continued to be like war for 30 years because, the growing number of demons was increasing rapidly. There were two fractions named \"Justice\" and \"Chaos\" that were facing against the demons. At this very moment, Taehwa appeared with his 12 pupils driving away the demons and spirits. Therefore, he used the great skill that the charm could lock up all demons in the temple of Tian Gui at Mt.Guwang. People got back to normal life farming and learning however, Yangak didn’t change his mind like others. He thought he was the best person who was able to meet Taehwa’s request. Sadly, Samuk succeeded to Taehwa’s title so Yangak felt severely scorned and inferior to Samuk. \n \nEunuch’s conspiracy \nAfter full of corruption, the whole country became peaceful. Even the little emperor was young, but he could suspect the eunuchs\u0027 corrupted actions. The little emperor called all of eunuchs and gave a severe scolding however they schemed to dethrone the emperor. More, to achieve their conspiracy, they bribed to bring attention to the masters of factions and also Yangak as well.",

Each level is made of a bunch of thin, floating platforms. When you approach the edge of a platform, you do not fall off - rather, you begin walking upside-down on the other side! Instead of jumping, you \"reverse the gravity\" of your croc, causing him to fall up or down until he lands on a platform. \n \nYou goal on each level is to light up all the bulbs by bumping them with your head. If you hit the bulb three times it will be completely lit up. Some bulbs are invisible on higher levels. There are also foes who want to stop you and who sabotage your efforts by bumping into the bulbs you\u0027ve lit, turning them off. Your foes can walk on both sides of the platforms just as you and can jump from platform to platform just as you, so watch out!",

While Nintendo did not get the NFL license for this one, it did secure the license of the NFL Player\u0027s Association, so the 8 teams to choose from (all named after the appropriate NFL cities) are all stocked up with real pro players from the 1989 season. You can even substitute second-stringers for the \"skill\" positions (QB, RB, WR, TE, and FS/SS) when your starters get tired. \n \nPlay perspective is very unusual: top-down slightly modified with a three-quarters tilt behind the offense, and the scrolling is diagonal, from the bottom left to upper right of the screen. Each team has 12 passing and 12 running plays on offense, and the option to reverse play designs effectively gives you a total of 48 potential plays to run. The defense has 8 cover plays and 8 blitzes to select from. The kicking and punting games are handled with a fairly typical directional arrow/power meter system. \n \nGames are divided into four 15-minute (accelerated real-time) quarters. There are no penalties, but referees do appear onscreen to signal touchdowns/field goals, take measurements on short yardage plays, and shout \"First Down!\" (in audio) whenever a team moves the chains. Team stats are displayed on a summary screen after every quarter of play. Highest scoring team wins, which in playoffs mode means moving on to the next round--and an eventual shot at winning it all in the Power Bowl!",

Well we have good news for you... \nGratuitous Space Battles is back! and it\u0027s approximately 50,000 times more gratuitous than before. A completely new ground-up rebuilding of the custom \u0027Gratuitous Engine\u0027 gives the game a completely new look, with beam-lasers 10x as \u0027beamy\u0027 as explosions 10x more gratuitous. \n \nYou now have complete control over your ships, and can build them from a base hull and a bunch of adjustable visual components so you have control of both the composition AND the looks of your deadly starships. GSB2 retains the core gameplay of the original. This is NOT a standard RTS game, but a management/simulation game about building space fleets and giving them orders. You aren\u0027t the dumb schmuck who actually flies into battle and gets lazered. Leave that to those patriotic and keen young dudes from the outer-colonies. Nope, your job is as supreme commander in chief. Sit back at fleet HQ and watch the fireworks as you reduce the enemy to space-dust. \n \nUsing it\u0027s amazingly asynchronous multiplayer online \u0027challenge\u0027 system, GSB2 lets you put together a whole fleet and upload it, orders, formations and custom ship designs in one, up to a server where fellow GSB2 players can download it and pit their own fleets against it in glorious combat.",

    "summary": "After two centuries of conflict, Humankind\u0027s three races – the Progen, Terrans and Jenquai – had achieved an uneasy balance of power by dividing known space between them. The Terrans claimed Earth, headquarters to their massive trade corporations. The genetically engineered Progen, bred for perfection, commanded the wastes of Mars. And the Jenquai, ever seeking knowledge, created great space stations to orbit the moons of Jupiter. Peace was shattered when the first stargate, an ancient artifact built by an unknown people, was discovered. Coveting its secrets for their own, the Jenquai hid the Gate from the other races. But their efforts were in vain; within months, a spy employed by the Terran conglomerate InfinitiCorp revealed the Gate\u0027s existence to the outraged Terrans and Progen. Humanity was suddenly thrust into conflict, an epic battle over control of the Gate. \n \nThe three races fought a devastating nine-year war, dubbed the Gate War, using weapons far deadlier than any previously conceived. Millions of lives were lost, and millions more would have perished had the Terrans not surprised their foes with a sudden cease-fire proposal. After months of negotiations, the three civilizations agreed to share the Gate, and declared an uneasy peace. However, InfinitiCorp had plans of its own. Under utmost secrecy, its scientists had reverse-engineered the Gate\u0027s technology, and within a few years the mighty conglomerate announced to the astonished worlds the genesis of the Infinitigate. \n \nFifty years have passed since the invention of the Infinitigate. Progen, Jenquai and Terrans alike have thrived, spreading their civilizations across a dozen star systems, exploiting their riches. However, though the races are at peace, acrimony remains. Tension and distrust govern galactic relations and every citizen fears the day when the spectre of war again raises its shadow.",

The Kamikaze can jump over projectiles, or kick them away if they\u0027re getting too close. However, the Kamikaze has a rage meter which will increase whenever he kicks. If the meter gets too high, he will explode, which will take away one of the Kamikaze\u0027s lives. If the Kamikaze runs out of lives, the player will lose and have to restart from the beginning. There is also a point system, which rewards the player for things like kicking back projectiles and killing Sam.\n\nThe levels take place in locations such as a desert and a forest. There are also challenge levels that test the player\u0027s skills, which are good for those that have completed the basic game and want more out of it.\n\nThe player can buy and wear heads for the Beheaded Kamikaze, which will change various attributes of him, such as changing the rage meter penalty for when the Kamikaze kicks a projectile away. These hats represent various characters in the Serious Sam series, such as the Sirian Werebull and the Kleer Skeleton.",

With a little help from your grandmother (a powerful witch in her own right) and Helios, your sharp-tongued cat familiar, you’ll explore enchanted lands inspired by your favorite fairy tales – often with an unexpected twist! \n \nAs powerful as your potions are, you’ll find yourself up against monsters that can shrug off your most powerful attacks. You’ll have to think on your feet and act quickly to sidestep danger.

He hopes to collect enough crystals to start a profitable twibble farm. \n \nCrystal Caves is a side-scrolling platform game, where the objective is to finish all 16 levels, collecting every single crystal within. On his way, Mylo is threatened by numerous monsters, such as bats, robots, mine carts or dinosaurs; there are also a lot of hazards such as stalactites and stalagmites, pipes which leak harmful water or poisonous mushrooms which kill instantly. Mylo has three health points, and if he is harmed enough times to deplete them all, he dies (but thankfully he has unlimited lives). To defend himself, Mylo has a missile pistol, which is able to take out most enemies, but not all. Many levels require the player to act fast and plan beforehand, as it\u0027s easy to get Mylo stuck in an impossible-to-win situation - if this happens, the level must be restarted. \n \nApart from the crystals, the levels contain a lot of items to collect: ammunition for the pistol, bonus items such as pickaxes or purple mushrooms that give score, and eggs which turn into letters when shot - collecting all 5 letters (B, O, N, U, S) on a level gives a lot of points, but it\u0027s not always easy to get them! It\u0027s also possible to find a power-up that reverses gravity when picked up, another one which gives your pistol the power to kill every enemy, a stop sign which freezes all enemies and makes them harmless and a red mushroom which allows you to kill enemies by running into them. These power-ups last only for a limited time though, so be careful, as they are always instrumental to victory!",

    "summary": "RailWorks, later simply Train Simulator, is a train simulation game developed by RailSimulator.com Ltd. It is the official successor to Rail Simulator, and was released online on 12 June 2009 and in stores on 3 July 2009.\nCompared to Rail Simulator, RailWorks contained new rolling stock, tools that previously had to be downloaded separately, graphical advancements such as modification of the existing content, bug fixes, backwards compatibility and the ability to trade elements from the virtual world with other users online. The first release of RailWorks contained all of the five real-world routes of the original European and North American releases of Rail Simulator, and added three new fictional routes: a large UK goods yard, a route set in the Alpine region and a route based around Denver, Colorado.\n\nIt is a Steamworks title, which means it uses and requires Steam to activate and to deliver core game updates. Steam is also used to deliver additional routes and locomotives in the form of DLC. The core game has received several free updates since release, including major new versions RailWorks 2: Train Simulator in 2010, RailWorks 3: Train Simulator 2012 in 2011, Train Simulator 2013 in 2012 and Train Simulator 2014 in 2013.",

With multi-directional dash and lock on abilities, the game has sometimes drawn comparisons to the Zone of the Enders series. \n \nThe game also has a handful of rail shooter levels, drawing frequent comparisons to Sega\u0027s Panzer Dragoon series, but these comprise only a very small portion of the game.",

The player takes control of the high wizard Petton Everhail, descending into the catacomb of the Towne Cemetery to defeat the evil lich Nemesis and rescue his friend Grelminar.\n\nCatacomb 3-D is a landmark title in terms of first-person graphics. The game was released in November 1991 and is arguably the first example of the modern, character-based first-person shooter genre, or at least it was a direct ancestor to the games that popularized the genre. It was released for DOS with EGA graphics. The game introduced the concept of showing the player\u0027s hand in the three-dimensional viewpoint, and an enhanced version of its technology was later used for the more successful and well-known Wolfenstein 3D.",

    "summary": "The game mechanics were based directly on those used in the tabletop role-playing games Tunnels and Trolls and Mercenaries, Spies and Private Eyes created by Wasteland developers Ken St. Andre and Michael Stackpole. Characters in Wasteland consequently have various statistics (strength, intelligence and luck among others) that allow them to use different skills and weapons. Experience is gained through battle and through use of skills. The game would generally let players advance with a variety of tactics: to get through a locked gate, a player could use his picklock skill, his climb skill, or his strength attribute; or he could force the gate with a crowbar - or a LAW rocket.\n\nThe initial band of Desert Rangers encountered a number of NPCs as the game progressed who could be recruited into the party of up to seven. Unlike those of other computer RPGs of the time, these NPCs might temporarily refuse to give up an item or perform an action if ordered to do so. The game was also noted for its high and unforgiving difficulty level and for such combat prose as \"reduced to a thin red paste\" and \"explodes like a blood sausage\", which prompted an unofficial PG-13 sticker on the game packaging in the United States.\n\nWasteland was one of the first games featuring a persistent world, where changes to the game world were stored and kept. Returning to areas later in the game, one would find them in the state one left them in, instead of being reset to their original state, as was common for games of the time. Since hard drives were still rare in home computers in 1988, this meant the original game disk had to be copied first, as the manual instructed one to do.",

Then, someone had superb thought to use PICO-8 for that. Retro feel and ease of use that came with this tool took us right away while technological constraints made it an intriguing design challenge. \n \nThanks to the PICO-8 community and zep for creating such an amazing tool. You guys made working on PICOHOT a blast! \n \nWHAT\u0027S THERE: \n- SUPERHOT’s “time moves only when you move” mechanic. \n- The Basic SUPERHOT three-color palette for clarity. \n- It’s 3D! \n- A few story levels and an endless mode.",
