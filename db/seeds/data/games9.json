But it\u0027s so much more than that. Incidentally, it is also Creative Reality\u0027s last game. Sharing the same team and the same writer than Dreamweb, it comes as no surprise that the game heavily relies on writing and puzzles. This reliance (and a few more things) makes Martian Gothic: Unification a title to look back at.",

As they just turned sixteen, they drive around the game boards, which look like cities, in their own cars. \n \nIn each turn of the main adventure mode, a spinner determines how far each player goes. Some spaces have special actions that move the player, assess fines or grant bonus, or allow the player to purchase items to help them in the game. If two players land on the same space, there is a head-to-head competition to determine who can stay. At the end of each round, there is a four-player minigame. These minigames can involve racing racing, windsurfing, kayaking, assembling a car from pieces to match a picture, tag, reflexes or any number of other things. Coins to purchase helpful items are awarded based on performance in these games. \n \nThere is also a Bring It On mode where victory is determined by winning a set number of minigames. This can be played with or without the game board and an Arcade mode, which allows you to just play the minigames.",

Two countries respectively ruled by Queen Xina and King Bodd have been competing over the right to explore the labyrinth. However, strange events started happening one after the other: the guardian of the labyrinth died, his daughter disappeared, and King Bodd apparently fell under some sort of a curse. A goblin reporter named Blount get caught in the midst of these events as he attempts to interview the queen and the king. As if that weren\u0027t enough, Blount also gets bitten by a werewolf and falls in love, and must find a way to deal with both predicaments.\n\nGoblins Quest is the third entry in the Gobliiins series. Like its predecessors, it is a puzzle adventure game with the emphasis on solving complex tasks confined to smaller areas rather than on exploration. Most levels occupy more than one screen and allow limited navigation between different areas. As the reduction of the title to a single \"i\" implies, this installment only features one controllable goblin. However, at various points of the game Blount will require assistance from other player-controlled characters such as Chump the parrot, Ooya the magician, and Fulbert the snake. In addition, Blount\u0027s own spontaneous transformation into a werewolf may affect the solution of some puzzles. The hero will also undergo a few other mutations and drastically change his size during the course of the game.",

This popularity can be attributed to the game\u0027s strong characters, evocative setting, and high replay value: each of the girls has her own personality and story, and in some cases it is difficult to make the correct choices to get together with a particular girl. \n \nThe game contains some thinly veiled references to several popular anime series, including Neon Genesis Evangelion, Magic Knight Rayearth and Saint Tail: each of the female characters bears a striking resemblance in appearance and (in most cases) personality to a girl from one of these anime.",

On Mars, the Union Aerospace Corporation has established a radioactive waste facility and allowed the military to conduct teleportation experiments on the nearby moons of Deimos and Phobos. Hours ago, the base on Mars began receiving incoherent distress messages from Phobos, while Deimos has disappeared completely. With all attempts to establish contact failing, you and your team have been dispatched to investigate. Upon arrival, you secure the perimeter as the rest of your team enters the facility. As you stand guard, your radio crackles with the sound of gunfire, cracking bones and blood-curdling screams and eventually falls silent. Alone, with no way off the planet or means to defend yourself other than your trusty pistol, there’s only one way out - into the complex of death and the horrors that await you within. If you plan to get out of here alive you must fend off the hordes of demonic imps, haunting spectres and your undead, former comrades waiting to tear you limb from limb. So, grab the nearest shotgun and blast your way out of this fragging madness!",

The seven mansions were strangely built in a Big Dipper formation on a remote island and have never been fully explored by the family members of Ippei\u0027s generation.

    "summary": "Similar to Prince of Persia, there are two major parts of play in Shadows of Cairn, both of which take place in the game itself. There\u0027s the platforming aspect of the game where you must guide Quinn over pits and through obstacles by running, jumping, climbing, and even hiding. There\u0027s also the fighting aspect of the game where Quinn has to fight enemies to progress by using an assortment of high, medium, or low punches or kicks. Quinn doesn\u0027t enter Fight Mode automatically, so if you want him to fight, you need to put him into Fight Mode. Unlike Prince of Persia, however, there are four difficulties to choose from which make the game easier or harder overall.\n\nThe game ushers you along by issuing way points directly under your Compass, showing you exactly where you need to be heading to progress the story. This could be anywhere from a local tavern to a magical tower on an entirely different tier of the city. Due to this linearity, it\u0027s almost impossible to become lost in the game or otherwise stuck. This game also has no inventory system, but there are chests scattered around the world which contain useful items such as Medical Herbs or quest-related items such as the Crazy Guy\u0027s Rat which progress the story or can be traded for other items such as new weaponry.\n\nAs stated, there are four difficulties. In addition to Easy, Normal, and Hard, a fourth difficulty–\"Very Easy\"–exists which allows you to cheat your way through the game by giving you infinite hit points or even making you complete immune to being hit. There doesn\u0027t seem to be any drawbacks to this mode aside from the possibility of getting stuck in certain traps which would otherwise kill you immediately.\n\nLastly, every now and then you\u0027ll be treated to an in-game animated cut scene which furthers the story of Quinn. These cut scenes are fully voiced (using tracks from the CD-ROM) and animated, the art style differing slightly from either the cover art or the in game sprites. (The art style is slightly reminiscent of certain Philips CD-i titles\u0027 cut scenes.)",

To make matches, swap two tiles to create a row of three or more of the same tile in a horizontal or vertical line. To clear most levels, you must make matches over gold tiles to remove them. Later, you will encounter unpolished tiles that must be matched twice to clear them. Each level has more than one board and most board are wider than the screen, requiring you to scroll to see everything. As you progress, items will hinder you like chains, fog and boxes. You will have assistance from other wizards with things like breaking groups of chains or temporarily clearing fog so you can see what gems are there. After a couple levels, when you match four items together, you create a rainbow gem that can be matched with any two gems that are the same color. When you match five gems, you create a helix that can clear an entire horizontal row.",

    "summary": "\"Unlimited SaGa\" is a sequel to Square\u0027s famous series of non-linear RPGs. Like in the early Romancing Saga games, and in Saga Frontier, you assume the role of eight main characters (selectable at the beginning of the game). The story centers around Laura, a 30-year old widow and an ex-pirate, but you view the story and make it progress differently depending on which character you have chosen, and on the decisions you take throughout the game. Each character is represented by a different kind of flower. \n \n\"Unlimited SaGa\" feels and plays a lot like a classic board RPG. Everything - from disarming traps to hitting the enemy successfully in a battle - depends on the so-called REEL system. You have to stop a spinning slot machine at the right time, in order to perform an action successfully. It is similar to the classic dice system in pen-and-paper RPGs, and to the Judgment Ring system in Shadow Hearts. You can explore the world in a non-linear fashion, visit many optional areas and fight monsters at your will. Some puzzles have multiple solutions and can be solved by using a character\u0027s special skill. For example, a character with a Swim skill can cross a river and reach the next area of the game.",

From there you\u0027re treated to a brilliant array of flashy graphics and atmospheric music which changes dramatically when you\u0027re set upon by Sauron\u0027s evil allies. \n \nThe superb sound effects also recreate the intense mood of the movies, with the chilling wail of the Dark Riders, howling wolves, battle cries of lumbering trolls and the metallic ring of clashing swords in battle making you feel like you\u0027re right in the middle of an epic and thrilling quest.",

    "summary": "The kids are arguing about their snowboarding skills. The debate escalates to the point where they decide to hold a snowboarding tournament to determine who is the best. One character, Shinobin, has no involvement whatsoever until he is unlocked by the player.\n\nIn addition to the usual gameplay of a snowboarding game, Snowboard Kids adds \"Shots\" (special weapons used to attack players) and items which can help the player, hinder other players, or both.\n\nThe game has nine main courses. Although some of the courses are snowy mountains, many are courses that would be unorthodox for snowboarding in the real world. Such courses include an amusement park, a desert, a vast valley, a dark highway, and a Japanese village during the cherry blossom festival.\n\nThere were several game mechanics that were unique to Snowboard Kids from other snowboard games and racing games at the time. One was the addition of the second item slot, allowing each player to carry a shooting item and support item (such as a rock, or invisibility) at the same time. Also, players needed to pay 100 gold in order to grab an item during the race, which could be obtained either through performing tricks or collecting coins scattered across the course. All courses also required players to race down the hill for multiple laps. Once a player had reached the bottom of the hill, he or she would need to pass through the lift gate to be transported back to the top of the hill, and could not be attacked by other players in this transition.",

You are playing a member of a Teutonic city named Teudogar and your tribe is faced with the question whether to arrange a alliance with Rome or to unify the Teutonic tribes to fight them. \n \nThe main feature of this game is the historical accuracy. Every aspect of the game world is researched to align with the historical facts. There is even a whole encyclopedia included. Otherwise it is a RPG in the style of Ultima VII: You explore the world in a isometric perspective, talk to a lot of people and solve quests. You have a lot of freedom what to do and what not do do - you can explore the world or concentrate on the plot. \n \nCombat is complete turn based but if you are wounded your combat abilities start to decrease dramatically. The character system is based on \"learning by doing\" - if you use a certain weapon you get better in using it. There are no experiment points. The interface and the movement are completely mouse-controlled.",

    "summary": "Groovy Greg set out to build robots that could love. Instead, he got the nanobots. Although the bots were designed to solve problems as a team, all their trial runs seem to end with the sound of tiny metallic fists meeting tiny metallic torsos. It’s enough to make even the most laid-back hippie want to tear out his dreadlocks. Now, with the evil Professor Killfun threatening to give him a failing grade, Groovy Greg has almost given up on his experiment. Little does he know that his beloved bots are about to meet an even bigger challenge than they had been programmed for... Nanobots is a classic-style point and click adventure game that lets you take control of Hotbot, Brainbot, Tallbot, Audbot, Strongbot, and Chembot as they race to save themselves from being turned into scrap metal. Can they make use of their surroundings, fashion an escape plan, and avoid coming face-to-fist with Professor Killfun? Only if they give peace a chance.",

Most of the courses in the games are designed to take advantage of this ability. \nThe game has a its variant of the traditional road course, but also introduces a new course type, known as a suicide course. Instead of being a continuous loop, these tracks have checkpoints at either end of the course, and the starting grid in the center. Characters race to one end, then turn around to head for the other checkpoint, repeating the process until all laps are complete. This provides a new gameplay dynamic as often the player must navigate oncoming traffic. Characters are split into teams, and bikes are adorned with logos of products such as Mountain Dew and Butterfinger, similar to real-life sponsored racing.",

Starting alone, the player must hunt, trade or pillage for supplies and materials in order to keep themselves fed, clothed, and healthy. With a focus on object physicality, these tasks are difficult to maintain alone, encouraging interaction with the humans who inhabit the world the players find themselves in. Different NPCs are better at certain tasks than others, and should be assigned to tasks accordingly. NPCs will develop relationships with each other based on interests, co-operative tasks, and other factors, which lead to scenarios of comradery, rivalry, affection and disdain. As time passes and NPCs grow together, families will form, babies will be born and elders will pass away. Life and its elements cycle on throughout gameplay, and affect the way the world is seen and the game is experienced."

Sophie is able to obtain ideas for recipes from activities such as harvesting, exploring, battling, or from events, and these ideas are used as a basis of improving her knowledge of alchemy.\n\nWhen she performs alchemy, the player is presented with various predetermined shapes representing the ingredients used, and arranges each shape on a puzzle board that represents the cauldron. This process involves visual trial-and-error, and if the shapes are arranged perfectly, the player receives a bonus. The materials selected affect the quality of the item synthesized. This system is intended to offer a high degree of freedom based on the player\u0027s own play style.",

It is a reimagining of the first installment in the series, MediEvil, with many alterations to the original structure and content, such as the addition of the \"Anubis Stone\" sub-plot which never appeared in the original. Many things such as level design and characters were changed drastically, and some levels from the original were removed altogether. New levels and characters were introduced, the cutscenes are completely original, and the game was given a much more comical, cartoon-like style as opposed to the Gothic horror-comedy of the original. The soundtrack is completely orchestrated, and half of the themes from the original were removed while new themes were created to fit with the new levels. Unlike the original, there is no alternate ending; Dan still goes to the Hall of Heroes regardless of whether he collects all of the chalices. The game also features a variety of voice talent, including Tom Baker as the narrator and the Grim Reaper.",

With full licenses from the NFL and its athletes, the game has all 31teams and 1500 players, plus perfect replication of logos and stadiums. The game’s five modes include Exhibition, Playoff, Season, Practice, and Simulation. Exhibition lets you take the field as any current NFL team, All-Star lineup, or Super Bowl team since 1967. All of the modes keep more comprehensive stats than you could ever hope for, and you can set up a Season to include preseason action, hot-cold streaks, and player development. Not only that, you can create players, teams, playbooks (with up 128 offensive plays), and profiles of chosen formations and pass-run ratios. There’s even a historical mode that allows you to tap into classic games of yesteryear, featuring teams that date back to 1967. ESPN’s Mike Patrick and Randy Cross chime in with commentary, and Brett Favre has returned yet again to add his insight. Throw a dozen camera angles into the mix, and you’ve got yourself a football game.",

Next to typical adventure gameplay such as exploration, conversations, and searching and combining items, there are also a few action sequences. The characters can duck, sneak, hang from ledges and move crates to reach higher areas.",

Some of these questions are difficult to answer, some of these questions may make you INCREDIBLY uncomfortable... Do you have what it takes to make it all the way through?

What fate lies in store for you at the end of this dirty little rabbit hole? We\u0027re about to find out... \n \nWhat is The Confession? Well, in essence, The Confession is a parody of our previous work and titles. It\u0027s our way of reading the feedback players have left for us, taking their words into heavy consideration, and making fun of ourselves! This title is not meant to be taken seriously, however, it doesn\u0027t mean it\u0027s not worth playing! Instead of giving you some sort of mind-blowing result, what we\u0027ve attempted to accomplish here is to simply put a smile on your face, perhaps a bit of disgust in your stomach, and unleash the inner-WTFness within all of us! We wanted to create something ridiculous, something unique, and something fun for all involved! We hope that you enjoy what we\u0027ve managed to put together for you. \n \nWarning: The Confession is an adult-themed game with graphic textual details. It is not intended for younger audiences or those who are prudish in any way, shape, or form. Some of the topics involved may be deemed lewd, crude, and incredibly offensive. We hope you enjoy your time playing, and may your panties remain unbunched!",
