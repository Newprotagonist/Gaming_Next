Now, Can you save yourself? \n \nAn asteroid the size of a small moon is on a crash course toward Earth, and only NASA veteran Boston Low has the expertise to stop it. Along for the ride are award-winning journalist Maggie Robbins and internationally renowned geologist Ludger Brink. \n \nOnce the wayward asteroid is nuked into a safe orbit, the trio conducts a routine examination of the rocky surface. \n \nWhat they uncover is anything but routine. \n \nLow, Brink and Robbins unwittingly trigger a mechanism that transforms the asteroid into a crystal-like spacecraft. The team is hurled across the galaxy to a planet so desolate, Brink is moved to name it Cocytus, after the 9th circle of Hell in Dante's Inferno. The bleak landscape was obviously once home to a highly enveloped civilization, with remnants of sophisticated architecture, advanced technology and an intricate network of underground tunnels. \n \nBut no Cocytans. \n \nWho were the original inhabitants of this once rich empire-turned-wasteland? What are those apparitions that mysteriously appear from time to time? Why have Low, Robbins and Brink been brought to this place? And how can Low keep his team from unraveling in the face of such uncertainly? To return to Earth, the must dig for answer, both on the planet's surface and deep within themselves. \n \nFrom the combined talents of LucasArts and legendary filmmaker Steven Spielberg comes an epic adventure that plunges headlong into the very core of the unknown.

A few settlements amidst rusty tanks is all that is left of civilization. The democratically elected government has some plans for improving the conditions of the world, but as you meet a young girl whom they used as a tool for their purpose, you realize you must find a better plan to save her, and the world, from complete destruction.\n\nThe fourth installment of the Wild Arms series abandons its traditional Wild West theme and is set in a post-apocalyptic world. The gameplay system introduces hex-based battles. Battle screens are divided into seven hexes, each one of which can hold several party members or foes. You navigate your characters on the battle field, trying to force the enemy into an uncomfortable position. There is also a variety of skills you can learn and apply in battles to get benefits. As in previous Wild Arms games, the dungeons contain many environmental puzzles to solve.","tags":[17,268435468,536871208,536871327,536871390,536871433,536871470,536871938,536872835,536874398,536874745,536875196,536875199,536875455,536875525,536875796,536875863,536875952,536876232,536876752,536877054,536877216,536878078,536879859],"videos":[{"id":47978,"video_id":"z-9rFhpng38"},{"id":47979,"video_id":"M_h0d2HH4KI"},{"id":47980,"video_id":"TJnFSFKk5ww"},{"id":47981,"video_id":"cfXzv0vMFA4"},{"id":47982,"video_id":"47h1O77E1xc"}]},{"id":17683,"aggregated_rating":70.0,"cover":{"id":77886,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co1o3i.jpg"},"name":"Polarity","platforms":[{"id":6,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}],"screenshots":[{"id":106424,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/as0jvnmej3xkyhi7than.jpg"},{"id":106425,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/d3sly7kzncuchc0udfwc.jpg"},{"id":106426,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/xaz3upsqdwti2cd0y4dw.jpg"},{"id":106427,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/duvitpqyqnpmhxbdxxdc.jpg"},{"id":106428,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/ertkn13vvz4x0bqt60nu.jpg"}],"summary":"Polarity features the same type of polished gameplay found in games like Portal, but is made exclusively for experienced gamers.

It is a Fable in one way, but in the 'trick of the tale', it's a strange adventure through a shattered world and a saga born out of the very sick mind of a man called Ismael.\n\nLong ago in the mists of time lived the Mecubarz. Ancient and beautiful, powerful and wise they ruled absolute. Strange beings, magical creatures and humans lived together in peace and harmony, until greed destroyed it all. Ismael, a respected man, and revered by all, sadly had a heart that was hollow and bitter. He and four others plotted to overthrow the Mecubarz.\n\nThe Mecubarz' fury at the treason of Ismael and his men was cataclysmic. They trapped the four seasons and put them into impenetrable crystals, casting them to the four corners of the shattered world where they stood still and were held in an eternal dominion of ice, mist, water, and fire. The four traitors were exiled, but Ismael disappeared.\n\nAs Quickthorpe, an inexperienced adventurer, your quest is to explore the Four Lands of the Mecubarz in search of the mystical gems that will liberate your people. Keen observation, puzzle-solving skill and quick thinking are the abilities required to undertake this exciting but unpredictable task. Interact with a universe of characters which come to life with true speech creating a world with an atmosphere so thick you can feel it. Combined stunning animations and atmospheric sound effects will ensure that Fable will take you on the journey of a lifetime!\n\nBut beware... in the world of Fable not everything is as it seems.","tags":[1,17,27,268435465,268435468,268435487,536871208,536871262,536871938,536871939,536873384,536873787,536875151,536876241,536877520,536879106],"videos":[{"id":1504,"video_id":"eAJiCERMxfI"}]},{"id":41926,"name":"Planetbound","platforms":[{"id":6,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}],"screenshots":[{"id":107290,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/yglxamgogyvsfkjdi4tg.jpg"},{"id":107291,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/v1up8j9ujqpnt3o0lvuw.jpg"},{"id":107292,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/d1c9g7yurrg4sme5n08t.jpg"},{"id":107293,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/cqoeygvuyputwd1xqxtl.jpg"},{"id":107294,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/lj54kckbc3ct1ww0p6qn.jpg"}],"summary":"Planetbound the ultimate rotatory shootemup packed with intense action, space worms and lots of stars!!!","tags":[1,268435488]},{"id":68170,"cover":{"id":83649,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co1sjl.jpg"},"name":"Spire of Sorcery","platforms":[{"id":6,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}],"screenshots":[{"id":125245,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/wquqx58q1izlpu9nm01l.jpg"},{"id":125246,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/lxniiiw1oj7qooucstjd.jpg"},{"id":125247,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/gacivjeyimnhcob8w8es.jpg"},{"id":125248,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/ab6lk2es8wzytw45pwgy.jpg"},{"id":125249,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/slnxytvgjqxjfzasncrw.jpg"}],"summary":"Ever since the ancient wars of mages, the world has been a dark place.

Your job includes setting out strategies, planning training sessions, keeping an eye on your players and attracting new talent, taking care of finances, and of course making sure that you win your matches. You will be given specific goals, such as qualifying for the champion's league, or defending the club's reputation. Games do not only include league matches, but friendlies and cup matches as well. \n \nThe actual games can be watched real-time in 3D, allowing for on-the-fly substitutions and tactical decisions, and a unique feature is you can both manage and play for a club, although there is no way to actually control players or actively participate. All players have different abilities and characteristics, which can be trained to create a well-balanced team.
