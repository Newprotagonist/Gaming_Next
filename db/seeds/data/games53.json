There was a time of legends and heroes, of incredible accomplishments and great deeds, a time when the world knew true grandeur. That time is long gone, however, crushed under the heel of fate and decay. The Elves are gone, now, victims to their own delusions. They failed to heed the warnings of the Harbinger, the one who came to warn them...\n\nHe arrived on the night the moons and the Centaur constellation were aligned, several millenia ago, his appearance foul and nightmarish, and warned all who would listen of the impending doom that lay ahead. He issued warnings and prophecies, but the Elves had grown vain and arrogant, and heeded him not. The Harbinger left, promising to return when the time would be right again.\n\nSeveral generations later-a short time by Elven reckoning-the Harbinger returned, once more treading under an alignment of the moons and constellations. The Elves had all but forgotten his past warnings. As the Curse fell upon their race, they stood defenseless. Despite their arcane lore and magical skills, they could not resist the godly powers that crushed them. When the Harbinger left their lands, there was not a single building standing. It is said that the winds carried the stench of death even as far as the Dwarven villages in the north. The latter took this for a sign that evil was coming, and prepared to defend themselves. When the Harbinger came to their lands to warn them too that their turn would come, that great danger lay ahead, they grew fearful of the visitor's appearance, and shunned him. He left them, warning them that achievements alone were not the measure of a worthy people.\n\nA millenia later, the skies repeated their fateful alignment of moons and stars. The Dwarves had flourished into a society of craftsmen and artisans. They had built great cities and were dutifully worshiping their god. Prophecies from long ago warned them against a fate similar to that of the Elves, so they had taken care to properly groom themselves and prepare for the Third Coming. When the Harbinger came to\nthem, however, they could not stand the sight and smell of him, and, mistaking him for some fiend from hell, immediately struck him down. This, historians say, was the very act that caused the downfall of the Dwarves. They also say that some humans witnessed the event, and that the Harbinger warned them as well, that he told them they too would be judged, lest their worthiness was greater than that of the Elves and the Dwarves.\n\nNow, it may be that none of this tale is true, that we are but a worried people living under an unusual alignment of stars, one which has not occurred in a thousand years, but maybe, just maybe, there is some truth to this tale. Maybe there really is a Harbinger that is walking the land even as we speak, walking towards us to judge us and torment us if we fail him. So, little scoundrel, before I kill you for your crimes, before I condemn your soul to everlasting fire, answer me this one question.","tags":[268435458,268435468,268435471,268435488,536871208,536871812,536875151,536875897],"videos":[{"id":52002,"video_id":"SluCXX5NDaw"}]},{"id":22389,"cover":{"id":157561,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co3dkp.jpg"},"name":"Death Note: Successors to L","platforms":[{"id":20,"name":"Nintendo DS"}],"summary":"Death Note: Successors to L was released in Japan on July 12, 2007.

These hardened military professionals, tired of bureaucracy, politics and serving the armed forces, have established a private paramilitary formation located in south United States. Being true military professionals, they periodically execute contracts for jobs that may not be considered “clean”.\n\nThe Team consists of many complex individuals with their own back story, but they do not shun mercenary applicants. Members of the team are idealists; they dwell on moral issues, as well as question blind nationalism, etc. AntiSquad strongly differ from military units. They truly are a bunch of contradictions put together - heartfelt cynics, gregarious egoists, aggressive pacifists, and phlegmatic rebels all under one banner.","tags":[1,268435468,268435471,268435472,268435487,268435488,536871938,536872070,536872406,536874694,536874916,536875046,536875062,536875063]},{"id":143264,"cover":{"id":129951,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co2s9r.jpg"},"name":"What Comes After","platforms":[{"id":6,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"},{"id":14,"name":"Mac"},{"id":130,"name":"Nintendo Switch"}],"screenshots":[{"id":421257,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc911l.jpg"},{"id":421258,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc911m.jpg"},{"id":421259,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc911n.jpg"}],"summary":"What Comes After is a side-scrolling adventure and a short heartwarming story about learning how to love yourself.

It is an updated version of Marvel vs. Capcom 3: Fate of Two Worlds. The game features characters from both Capcom's video game franchises and comic book series published by Marvel Comics. The game was released in November 2011 for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360, and was featured as a launch title for the PlayStation Vita in 2012. \n \nIn Ultimate Marvel vs. Capcom 3, players select a team of three characters to engage in combat and attempt to knock out their opponents. As an update, the game utilizes largely identical gameplay mechanics to the original. However, both the aerial combat and X-Factor systems, introduced in Fate of Two Worlds, have received adjustments. In addition to gameplay modifications and new playable characters, the game features several aesthetic changes. \n \nAfter the events of the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami disrupted the development schedule for downloadable content for Fate of Two Worlds, the additional content was created into a standalone title, Ultimate Marvel vs. Capcom 3, for a discounted retail price. The game received generally positive reviews upon release; critics praised the expanded character roster and improved online experience, but criticized the lack of new features and game modes.","tags":[1,268435460,536870915,536870926,536871019,536871123,536871138,536871213,536871400,536871501,536871580,536871633,536871706,536871784,536871889,536871987,536872070,536872143,536872205,536872211,536872234,536872245,536872651,536872898,536873064,536873066,536873067,536873208,536873299,536873455,536873591,536874182,536874343,536874452,536874552,536874655,536874801,536874846,536874994,536875046,536875054,536875073,536875074,536875093,536875125,536875157,536875178,536875198,536875199,536875214,536875298,536875310,536875378,536875435,536875458,536875488,536875556,536875590,536875645,536875697,536875716,536875717,536875781,536875802,536875803,536875819,536875825,536875854,536876007,536876057,536876092,536876113,536876208,536876235,536876240,536876266,536876273,536876306,536876310,536876352,536876471,536876493,536876575,536876643,536876695,536876706,536876719,536876762,536876763,536876803,536876805,536876806,536876810,536876817,536876818,536876819,536876820,536876821,536876822,536876823,536876824,536876825,536876830,536876831,536876927,536876928,536876948,536877001,536877012,536877016,536877297,536877309,536877406,536877412,536877418,536877445,536877449,536877531,536877628,536877691,536877696,536877739,536877764,536877786,536877943,536878133,536878197,536878212,536878223,536878245,536878267,536878301,536878393,536878513,536878520,536878562,536878612,536879103,536879202,536879688,536879878,536879969,536880203,536880272,536880368,536880547,536880580,536880749,536880765,536880777,536880921,536881080,536881626,536881969,536881970,536882030,536882292,536882446,536882611,536882654,536882694,536882784,536882785,536882786,536882787,536882788,536882789],"videos":[{"id":11141,"video_id":"_KctMDsHVF8"}]},{"id":82377,"cover":{"id":58440,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/febsmjoaioceew3hohvw.jpg"},"name":"Arcade Game Series: Dig Dug","platforms":[{"id":6,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"},{"id":48,"name":"PlayStation 4"},{"id":49,"name":"Xbox One"}],"screenshots":[{"id":146118,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/vm1whru9vpufplv8wagn.jpg"},{"id":146119,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/es2p2qngrtjjkrgozmed.jpg"},{"id":146120,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/plimu3kyqk8evo1xinik.jpg"},{"id":146121,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/qdqgpsxofniexhkarkcy.jpg"},{"id":146122,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/cx0zrsxgum016uf16yyl.jpg"}],"summary":"First appearing in arcades in 1982, Dig Dug finally comes to Xbox One!\nDig up, down, left, and right and burrow through the earth.\nInflate and pop enemies with your harpoon to defeat them, or squish them with a rock.\nLure enemies into a tunnel and crush several at once for massive points.\nDefeat all the enemies on the screen to advance to the next stage!\n\nPerform a range of techniques, including the rock drop and the \"pump and stall,\" using just 4 directions and a single button!

The Mac OS X version of the game was released by Feral Interactive.","tags":[1,268435487,536871322]},{"id":59371,"cover":{"id":161114,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co3gbe.jpg"},"name":"Way of the Samurai Portable 2","platforms":[{"id":38,"name":"PlayStation Portable"}],"summary":"A Japan only PlayStation Portable entry into the beloved Way of the Samurai series developed by Spike","tags":[17,22,268435487,536871165,536871945,536873370,536875046,536875067]},{"id":78698,"cover":{"id":189532,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co428s.jpg"},"name":"Heat","platforms":[{"id":6,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}],"screenshots":[{"id":270522,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc5sqi.jpg"},{"id":270523,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc5sqj.jpg"},{"id":270524,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc5sqk.jpg"},{"id":270525,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc5sql.jpg"},{"id":270526,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc5sqm.jpg"},{"id":270527,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc5sqn.jpg"},{"id":270528,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc5sqo.jpg"},{"id":270529,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc5sqp.jpg"},{"id":270530,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc5sqq.jpg"},{"id":270531,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc5sqr.jpg"},{"id":270532,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc5sqs.jpg"},{"id":270533,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc5sqt.jpg"}],"summary":"Heat was a video game coming to, \"next generation platforms,\" based on the movie of the same name.

A new choice is the warrior Lu Bu. The characters have their own, unique story paths, which are affected by choices and outcomes occurring during the chapters the game is divided into. The player organizes and moves his officers and armies over the map while engaging others, trying to fulfill certain objectives during a turn limit. \n \nFor battles, the game switches from the map to a dedicated screen showing the battlefield. The battle system is a bit like chess: the player moves the units around the battlefield in a turn-based fashion, mostly trying to bring them in a position to pull off special tactics. Ideally, this results in effective combos, that may not only defeat enemy units, but also capture the leading officers, which may join the player (there are over 200 in the game). \n \nMorale and terrain need to be taken into consideration as well. Units have different abilities depending on their type and position in the army, Engineers may build useful installments like supply depots for example. Army strategists can use the link command retained from the previous game for pinning down enemy units and helping to rack up higher combos, in addition, they may order chains now. These allow individual officers to perform multiple tactics (provided the conditions are met for each of them), but cost morale. \n \nThe game also contains a two player versus mode, which consists of random battles.","tags":[39,268435460,268435468,268435471,268435472,536871139,536871535,536872835,536873473,536874694,536875196,536875304,536875460,536875525,536875803,536875952,536876056,536877003,536880805,536888127,536888375,536891338,536891339]},{"id":63363,"cover":{"id":37214,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/zs1ctanhkyo4nishpgql.jpg"},"name":"Super Robot Taisen OG Saga: Masou Kishin III: Pride of Justice","platforms":[{"id":9,"name":"PlayStation 3"}],"summary":"The third game in the Masou Kishin sidestory of the Super Robot Wars' classic timeline.","tags":[18,268435468,268435469,268435471,268435480,536871882,536871938,536872060,536874694,536875046]},{"id":33109,"cover":{"id":38732,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/bmtapqlzb0qxnakmhepn.jpg"},"name":"GAIN","platforms":[{"id":6,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}],"screenshots":[{"id":57469,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/tddcfddy0axhhyydnycc.jpg"},{"id":57470,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/euwvifd8bjiembi54zmp.jpg"},{"id":57471,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/wucf2yx3wf1whmprpajr.jpg"},{"id":57472,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/nfzzqqnjgurrcuputmzy.jpg"},{"id":57473,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/ax9bdai3wkeenwvyur7w.jpg"}],"summary":"The job is simple: Dont die!

And you'll soon learn that in this league nothing's ever given to you, and before you can reach your goals - you have to score them. You've gotta master the artful skill of a finesse player and the bone crushing brutality of an enforcer. You'd better be versatile as well, because you must skillfully control your forwards, centers, defensemen and even the goalie, who'll defend the net against unrelenting Power Plays (which will occur if you lose a fight and have your battered carcass banned to the Penalty Box).","tags":[32,268435470,536870956,536871186,536871745,536871889,536872078,536872219,536873991,536875199,536875206,536875234,536875434,536875464,536875473,536875474,536875870,536876069,536876237,536876348,536876999,536880906,536881973,536883947,536884918]},{"id":122348,"cover":{"id":80915,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co1qfn.jpg"},"name":"GOREBALL","platforms":[{"id":6,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"},{"id":82,"name":"Web browser"}],"summary":"You have only one weapon - the almighty GOREBALL.

Mysterious blue bombs have appeared all over the planet, and King Clown needs help. In a royal decree, the king beckons for Kid Clown, a hero of past Kemco games, to clean up these bombs in all six continents. The strange, yet brave little clown sets out to blast the bombs away before the planet explodes.\n\nClearing these bombs will not always be easy, as they have been arranged in puzzles across 60 different levels. Kid Clown must act wisely, because each level has only one igniter bomb that can detonate the bombs surrounding it. To successfully complete a level in one try, Kid Clown must arrange the bombs so that a chain reaction takes place. He also has to get a safe distance away from the reaction or he will explode.","tags":[1,268435465,536873787,536875262,536875284]}]
