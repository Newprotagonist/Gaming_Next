    "summary": "Men of War: Vietnam is a new game in the critically acclaimed series. Two new, story-driven campaigns let you taste the explosive mix of the jungle, Hueys and rock-n-roll in early 1968.\n\nThe US campaign focuses on a team of elite special ops soldiers, and each one of them has a personality. The unit includes Sergeant John Merrill, machinegunner Jim Walsh, sniper Sonny Armstrong, grenade launcher operator Carl Dillan and combat engineer Bill Kirby. In some missions they can count only on themselves, while in the others they act together with regular US and South-Vietnamese troops.\n\nThe North Vietnam campaign tells the story of two Soviet military consultants and two soldiers of the North Vietnam Army who are the only survivors of an ambush prepared by the US troops. The task of getting back to the North Vietnam territory is a difficult one - they have no means of radio communication, no wheeled vehicles, and it\u0027s too far to make it there on foot. On their way these survivors get involved in a chain of bloodbath engagements and find themselves in the dead center of the well-known Tet offensive.\n\nMissions range from special operations to full scale battles.",

The game is a dark mix of eldritch horror, open-world exploration, realistic weapon handling and intriguing storyline that will make you feel like you\u0027re in the middle of the post-apocalyptic Pechorsk Radius zone. \n \nLife and death intertwine inside the Radius, lurking somewhere in the middle of everything is the answer to a question you can\u0027t quite remember. Through the flickering memories of your tarnished life as a former resident of Pechorsk and now UNSPC specialist, your only means of survival is to stalk the strange and threatening zone and complete the missions assigned to you. \n \nShoot Fast and Take Cover \nTake cover and beware of the threats around you. Gunplay and real bullet physics will keep you on your toes. Featuring classics like the Pistolet Makarova, Double Barrel Shotgun and the AKM Kalashnikov. Weapon interactions are based on their real-life counterparts. Handling, aiming and reloading uses similar movements to their real-world versions. \n \nWeapons have unique ammo and suitable attachments, but must be taken care of or else they will begin to jam! \n \nInteresting Story \nEver since the mysterious and deadly Pechorsk Radius appeared, it had been the single most discussed topic in the media, scientific communities, and political establishments. \n \nRumors, conspiracies, and legends slowly began to emerge; speaking of wondrous artifacts, deadly anomalies and bizarre entities that inhabit the once quiet mining town. \n \nToday interest has faded, the exclusion zone around the Pechorsk Radius remains completely restricted to the public. Only authorized personnel from the UN Pechorsk Special Committee have any real knowledge of what the Radius truly is. \n \nHardcore Gameplay \nWe placed player skill as one of the important focuses of the game. In order to survive inside the Radius you\u0027ll need to pick the right gear for your journey, understand how to navigate the dangerous terrain and discover what kind of anomalies exist, in order to complete your objectives. \n \nExplore Extraordinary Landscapes \nFifteen years after the Pechorsk Event, the Radius has been almost completely abandoned and stands as an isolated and blighted territory. There are miles and miles of forests and crumbling industrial ruins to explore however you want. Be warned, the Radius is filled with lethal anomalies and rumored to contain hostile forces that threaten anyone foolish or daring enough to risk their lives exploring it.",

The single-player story follows the life of Tier 1 soldier Preacher as he struggles to readjust to civilian life, only to have his world rocked when a massive PETN bomb goes off on U.S. soil. Players then join familiar characters Stump, Mother, and Voodoo as they attempt to track down the source of the explosives.\n\nThough the game is still built on EA DICE\u0027s Frostbite 2 engine, Danger Close Games handled all development of Warfighter, including the new Fireteam multiplayer mode in which two players join forces to share health and ammo during battle. Gamers can select special Tier 1 soldiers from ten different countries, including Germany, South Korea, Russia, and three different branches of the U.S. military, and then choose from the Assault, Sniper, Demolitions, Point Man, Heavy Gunner, and Spec Ops character classes. As many as 20 players can compete across eight different maps in a variety of modes, including Combat Mission, Team Deathmatch, and Sector Control.",

But above everything else: defend the Mainframe!\n\n* RETRO STYLE: Graphics, inspired by 80s terminal PC with hybrid synthwave soundtrack.\n\n* DIVERSE TACTICS: Cook enemy robots to death, bury them under your bullets, eliminate with single powerful shot, or render your opponents useless with debuffs - this game is designed with a lot of viable strategies in mind.\n\n* BUILD YOUR SQUAD: Similar to how in card games you have to build your deck, in MAINFRAME DEFENDERS you have to combine different items with unique abilities, to create unstopable squad. Work around item drawbacks or double down on them, creating flawed, yet powerful build! Over 100 obtainable items in demo version alone!\n\n* UNIQUE ENEMIES: Enemy squad woun\u0027t sit idle, though. Each unit have its own role in squad, and designed to couter certain strategies. Pick your targets wisely, or you will lose.\n\n* PROCEDURAL LEVELS: Hand-made rooms are combined with procedural generation to create random levels. Missions have differing objectives, combined with unique mission conditions. Will you accept the challenge or avoid the unknown and risk to fall behind?",

You can order them to follow you or to roam the floor killing all they find. The player can also freely jump between their bodies in the games take on a lives system; as long as the team member they are in isn\u0027t killed there is no limit on this.\n\nOBC also features a near fully destructible environment; the Flame Thrower can set bad guys, scenery and the level itself on fire, which could make movement extremely hazardous for the player, especially as the fire randomly spreads. The Grenade launcher meanwhile can destroy any wall (with some hard coded exceptions).\n\nLike Blake Stone OBC also features textured floors and ceilings. Though unlike Blake, OBC could have several different floor textures on the same map. However OBC\u0027s floor/ceiling graphics were partially parallax meaning they appeared to \"warp\" as the player moves around.",

    "summary": "Dungeons \u0026 Dragons: Dragonshard is a real-time strategy role-playing video game, developed for Microsoft Windows by Liquid Entertainment, and published by Atari in 2005. It takes place in Eberron, one of the official Dungeons \u0026 Dragons campaign settings. The game combines elements of traditional real-time strategy gameplay with role-playing elements such as hero units, and questing. Dragonshard includes two single-player campaigns, single-player skirmish maps, and multiplayer support. The single-player campaign follows the struggles of three competing factions to gain control of a magical artifact known as the Heart of Siberys. \n \nAlthough Dragonshard was billed by Atari as \"the first Dungeons \u0026 Dragons real-time strategy experience,\"[2] Stronghold (1993) precedes it by over a decade.[3]",

    "summary": "\"Bringing a unique twist to the classic gameplay of the cult board game, engage in bloody battles through an immense Space Hulk - a twisted mass of asteroids, wrecked ships and debris – as either a squad of Terminator Space Marines or the deadly alien Genestealers. Which side will you choose?\n\nBattle through two distinct, narrative-driven campaigns, from the points of view of two different factions: one campaign puts you in control of a Blood Angels squad, which you will customise and upgrade as you progress, while the other puts you in control of the Genestealers for the first time in a Space Hulk game!\n\nSpace Hulk: Tactics is based on the rules of the popular board game, given a fresh new spin in the form of the unique Card system. Cards give more ways to customize your squad before a match, and allow you to turn the tides of battle with abilities that trigger game-changing effects when used at the right moment.\n\nTest your skills against other players in the expansive online competitive multiplayer, letting you command a swarm of Genestealers or a custom squad of different unit types from one of four Space Marine Chapters – the Blood Angels, the Space Wolves, the Ultramarines, and the Dark Angels. Multiplayer modes and tools offer a rich and deep online experience, and include an intuitive map creation tool, which gives players everything they need to create original maps with custom objective, and share them with other players to play either online or against the AI, all from within the game!\"",

The game is a continuation of the KAGERO: Deception series that began on the Playstation, but players aren\u0027t required to play the original games to understand TRAPT. The storyline begins when Princess Allura is framed for killing her father. As she flees the castle, players learn her dark secret: she\u0027s possessed by a demon known as Fiend. Fiend allows Allura to set a number of different traps to kill people, giving Fiend souls to survive off of. As the storyline progresses, players learn more about Fiend and how he came to possess the princess. The gameplay in TRAPT is very unique. As Allura, players run around the room setting traps while avoiding enemies. Once up to nine traps are set, they can be activated once an enemy is near. The traps come in a number of different types, including floor traps like bombs, wall traps like spikes, and ceiling traps like metal balls. Once players understand the system, they can start laying out traps in a way that an enemy will be hit by several at once to create a combo. Of course, it isn\u0027t quite that simple: some enemies are immune to certain traps, and some rooms contain areas where traps can\u0027t be placed. TRAPT weaves together unique characters, horror elements, and a fun, different gameplay style to create a unique game that will provide hours of challenge.",

Only triangles can push balls. Triangles also stun players on impact. Hold any button to charge bigger triangles. Bigger triangles push harder. Push balls into the opposing goal to score points. Hold a button long enough to build a defensive square. Shoot defensive squares to destroy them.",

They devote themselves to fighting against the never-ending resistance mustered by other tribes. In the midst of chaos, a mysterious object, the Pod, suddenly appears. Countless spheres of light are emitted by the Pod and infect Serf and his comrades, awakening their demonic powers. An unimaginable battle unfolds within their faint conscience. They develop a desire to tear the flesh and shatter the bones of their enemies, who have also been transformed. Their instincts tell them to devour every being in their path. Until then, Serf and his comrades only knew of battle, but for the first time, they experience new emotions. At that time, a dark-haired girl, Sera, comes to their rescue. Although she does not know where she came from, she holds a strange power - the power to control the party\u0027s demonic transformation. They receive orders from the Church of Karma to head for Nirvana, and they are accompanied by the dark-haired girl. \"They who reach Nirvana first shall be recognized as the champions of Junkyard.\" The struggle intensifies, and they discover that the girl holds a key to the mystery. But, true fear still awaits Serf\u0027s party. Including Embryon, the tribe that the main character leads, several groups are at war with each other in order to survive. \"Devour\" your enemies and absorb their devastating powers and special abilities!",

The protagonist, who becomes the deputy head of the council, chooses a buddy from four characters to defy the unreasonable.\n\nThe main story has multiple endings. There are different routes for each of the four buddy characters. To make multiple playthroughs easier, you can also skip shared routes and advance through different buddy routes.\n\nBattles are command-based with a free move turn system. Increasing your madness will allow you to use more powerful skills, but if you increase it too much, you will go insane and rampage against targets both friend and foe, making it impossible to fight.\n\nThere is also an “EGO” system, which represents the player’s desire levels of pride, wrath, envy, lust, gluttony, and sloth. These change depending on your diagnosis and the choices you make, and also affect the demons you can employ as your “underlings.”",

Amount of players can vary from 1-4 players and the game is suitable for people of all ages. \n \nEyeToy: Play 3 provides single player challenges such as Ghost Grab where you enter a ghost house and try to catch ghosts while trying to avoid objects thrown at you and Boot Camp where you try to pass the different challenges thrown at you such as running through an obstacle course or following sergeants orders. Additionally, for someone preferring slightly less intense action, there is music conducting and working in a beauty salon. \n \nHowever when two or more players are included many more games open in party mode such as Monkey Rampage, Kitty Loves Me and Athletics, with bowling, American football and such. These party games are fast-paced and usually all 4-players can play on the screen at the same time.",

It turns out that Eggman Nega (once again masquerading as Doctor Eggman) has stolen the Chao and concealed them inside a haunted mansion. His plan is to feed them to an inter-dimensional beast called the \"Ifrit\" who needs to eat them to become invincible . After that, he plans to release the Ifrit into the world in order to destroy it. However, to open the portal to the Ifrit\u0027s world, the seven Chaos Emeralds are required. Eggman Nega secretly hires Rouge the Bat to collect the Chaos Emeralds. The Master Emerald has also gone missing (again) and Knuckles the Echidna teams up with Rouge to find it.\nMeanwhile, Silver the Hedgehog has returned from a now ruined future caused by the Ifrit. In order to make a happier future, he searches for and steals the Chao that are left in order to hide them. Espio first thought that Silver was hiding Chao for a cause of evil, but Espio finds out that Silver was trying to save the world. Then, they work together to save the world. The real Dr. Eggman sends Metal Sonic to find Shadow, and tells him of Nega\u0027s plans. Nega has learned of the Ifrit by accessing Professor Gerald Robotnik\u0027s journals, and Shadow and Metal Sonic set out to retrieve the Chaos Emeralds before he does. Eggman uses Metal Sonic as a communication device to aid Shadow along the way.\n\nAll of the teams meet up at the Mystic Haunt Zone where the portal to the Ifrit\u0027s world is. Despite Rouge only collecting six of the Emeralds, the portal opens anyway and Nega dispatches his newly copy of Metal Sonic, Metal Sonic 3.0 to awaken the Ifrit. Despite possessing the minds of Sonic, Tails, Knuckles, and Rouge (depending on who the player plays as), the Ifrit is defeated by the other teams. Shadow and Metal Sonic defeat the Ifrit and close the portal but they and Eggman Nega are trapped in the Ifrit\u0027s dimension. However, Metal Sonic tears his chassis open, revealing the 7th Chaos Emerald. Shadow uses the Emerald to teleport back with Metal Sonic. Nega is left trapped under some rubble.\n\nSonic and Tails save all the Chao and bring them to a Chao Garden and relax there while Knuckles finds the Master Emerald in the Emerald Detector that he and Rouge stole from Eggman Nega. Rouge steals the Master Emerald and runs, and Silver returns to what he hopes is a happy future. Espio has to answer to Vector the Crocodile who has spent their client\u0027s advanced payment on late rental fees.",

By meeting the needs of the animals and achieving a predetermined ‘happiness’ level, new areas of the world are unlocked. The game provides the player with quests that either improve the general living conditions or meet the happiness needs of particular animals. Multiplayer comes in the form of up to four-player simultaneous interaction via four Wii remotes, with the potential for either cooperative play with positive outcomes or conflicting goals and unpredictable results.",

This can include racing against a clock, solving puzzles, and a lot of fun with physics, which often involves causing mayhem by knocking things over or blowing them up. The game also has a strong local multiplayer element, for full split-screen enjoyment, including a variety of different challenges.\n\nTo save themselves from bankruptcy, the GPS have somehow created living boxes that can deliver themselves to customers all over the world, to save on human staff. In Unbox, you will play as their latest creation, Newbie, and it is your job to complete the test islands, proving your worth as a sentient, self-delivering package.",

    "summary": "Description of NFL Head Coach 09 \nEA\u0027s football coach simulator heads back to the gridiron in NFL Head Coach 09. With gameplay more akin to European-style \"Soccer Manager\" games than the Madden NFL franchise from which it spawned, the original NFL Head Coach generally received lukewarm reviews from critics. But after a one-year hiatus -- during which it presumably did a little TV and work spent some quality time with the family -- the franchise returns with a new focus on depth and realism. Once again the coach\u0027s livelihood depends on his approval rating, and everything gamers do, from win/loss record, to going for it on fourth down, to choosing whether to yell at the QB after a bad interception, will affect approval rating. \n \nKey personnel decisions have been given an added sense of urgency with the new Live Event feature, which puts all trade, free agency, coaching, and contract negotiations up against a running timer. As in real life, the draft is the centerpiece of the NFL offseason, and gamers can prepare by scouting players in college all-star games, at the NFL combine, and during pro-day and individual workouts. Meanwhile, players can get running commentary on the lives and college careers of more than 20,000 unique draft prospects from NFL Network personality Adam Schefter. Other additions intended to increase realism include: Non-drafted free agent rookies, 75-man preseason rosters, trades involving future draft picks, a new wear and tear injury system, and 300 new sideline animations. \n \nNFL Head Coach 09\u0027s online features allow gamers to upload created plays and download, rate, or view any play available. Two players can also go head-to-head in a quick test of coaching acumen. Offline, gamers can adjust their plays in the middle of a game and save the new formations, or create entire playbooks using the coach clipboard user interface. All created plays can then be exported and used in Madden NFL 09. ~ Christopher Brown, All Game Guide",

You can choose from five different cars, each with its own abilities that increase during the course of the race including one car that becomes invincible and another that gains a huge burst of speed. After you choose the correct car for your driving style, hit one of the 20 tracks available in the game. While you\u0027re on the track, you need to keep an eye out for the oil slicks, water puddles, and random debris that will slow down or damage your car. If the car sustains too much damage, then the race is over, for you anyway. Luckily, there is a truck to refuel and repair your vehicle. Will you be able to cross the finish line in NASCAR RACERS?\n\nIt was published in 2000 for Microsoft Windows and Game Boy Color by Hasbro and developed by Software Creations (PC) and Digital Eclipse (GBC). A PlayStation version was planned but cancelled before release.",

The player has a certain amount of time to complete each race, but more time may be gained by collecting bonuses, damaging the competitors\u0027 cars or by running over pedestrians.\n\nRaces are completed by either completing the course as one would a normal racing game, \"wasting\" (wrecking) all other race cars, or killing all pedestrians on the level.\n\nThe game was notable for its realistic and ground-breaking physics and for its in-game movie making features. It was also one of the earliest examples of sandbox 3D driving games, and may have influenced other later games including Driver and the Grand Theft Auto series.",

    "summary": "Super Demo World: The Legend Continues is a project put together with the goal of displaying the capabilities of the SMW Level Editor Lunar Magic.\n\nSuper Demo World, was first released in 2001 as a few short levels to show off custom blocks which had varying requirements for when they could be broken such as the typical only when big breakable bricks or bricks that could only be broken with a fireball. Since then, the project has gone on to be a complete hack of SWM spanning across and heavily altering all of its levels.\n\nAs this hack is designed with the explicit goal of showing off Lunar Magic, players will find a wide variety of challenges across Super Demo World‘s many meticulously crafted levels and will assuredly find themselves stretching out fiber of their SMW muscles along the way.\n\nEach on of the castles in this hack come with a quirky blurb at the end once you defeat the boss, many of them referring to bizarre or somewhat dark scenarios where the Koopa’s were experimenting on the eggs or simply hording them for buffets.",

And he will need all of them because just before starting his escape he realizes that there are other people trapped in that mining hell. At the controls of his incredible machine, the protagonist will be able to explore the environment and solve the puzzles that block his way. As it happens with mini-golf, that involves aiming and measuring your trajectory with precision. You will also have to use different steam balls to solve many challenging puzzles. Thanks to these balls you can cause explosions to destroy obstacles or create ramps and walls in order to have an easier time down there.
