    "summary": "Following the defeat of the evil triad in the previous three Ultima games, the world of Sosaria changed beyond recognition: continents rose and sank, and new cities were built, heralding the advent of a different civilization. Unified by the reign of the benevolent monarch Lord British, the new world was renamed Britannia. Lord British wished to base people\u0027s well-being on the ethical principles of Truth, Love, and Courage, proclaiming the Eight Virtues (Honesty, Compassion, Valor, Justice, Sacrifice, Honor, Spirituality, and Humility) as the ideal everyone should strive for. The person who could accomplish full understanding and realization of these virtues would serve as a spiritual leader and a moral example for the inhabitants of Britannia; he alone would be able to obtain holy artifacts, descend into the Stygian Abyss, and access the Codex of Ultimate Wisdom. This person is the Avatar. \n \nThe fourth game in the Ultima series features an improved game engine, with color graphics and enhanced character interaction: the player can have conversations with non-playable characters by typing names of various topics. However, the main difference between Ultima IV and its predecessors in the series (as well as other role-playing games) lies in the game\u0027s objectives and the ways to fulfill them. \n \nInstead of building up a character by any means possible in order to face a villain in the end of the game, in Ultima IV the player is trying to become the Avatar, a role model for people. This means upholding the Eight Virtues, basically trying to become a better person. Making morally conscious decisions and helping other people is not done expecting a material reward, but because it is the actual goal of the game and the main focus of its gameplay. The game frowns on behavior typical of most other RPGs, such as backstabbing fleeing enemies or picking up everything that isn\u0027t nailed down even if it does not belong to the protagonist. This different approach established the game\u0027s reputation as the first \"true\" Ultima, influencing the design philosophy of later installments and the overall spirit of the series. \n \nCharacter creation is done by choosing responses to morally ambiguous questions. Each of the Eight Virtues corresponds to a character class; by determining the player\u0027s personal priorities in the virtues, the game assigns a class and a starting location for the Avatar. After emerging in Britannia, the player is free to explore it in various ways (on foot, moongate teleportation, on horseback, by ship, etc.). Certain items must be collected in any order to enter the Stygian Abyss and complete the game. The Avatar also has to reach the highest level in all virtues. This is achieved by various means: donating blood increases Sacrifice, not fleeing from combat increases Valor, etc. The process, however, is not irreversible: should the Avatar overpay a blind seller, he gains Compassion points; should he, on the other hand, cheat the seller by underpaying, his level in several virtues would decrease. \n \nThese unorthodox features of the game co-exist with plenty of traditional RPG elements, such as dungeons to explore and hostile monsters to kill. Enemies are encountered on the world map as well as in dungeons; combat takes place on separate top-down screens, allowing player-controlled and enemy parties freely move on them. Characters accumulate experience points and level up, gaining higher amount of hit points and access to stronger magic spells. Like in the previous installments of the series, world map, town exploration and combat are presented from a top-down view, while the dungeons are pseudo-3D and are explored from first-person perspective. \n \nUltima IV also introduces several new gameplay features to the series and role-playing games in general. A number of initially non-playable characters living in various areas of the game world are able to to join the party and fight alongside the hero, replacing traditional player-generated characters or mercenaries and adventurers available only in special locations. Additional new elements include buying and combining reagents in order to cast spells, puzzle rooms in dungeons, and others. \n \nThe FM Towns version, while identical to the others in gameplay, introduces upgraded graphics similar to those used in next installment of the series.",

    "summary": "The Godfather: Blackhand Edition, is the highest rated version of The Godfather on Gamerankings and IGN, despite not faring as well with other publications. It features 20 normal missions, ten new hit missions, a new rival family seen only in the new hit missions, rooftop battles, new favors, and other methods such as blackmail and bribery. \n \nThe Blackhand Edition adds a second path that the player may take through the game, that of the operator. The main method of progression is by blackmailing police, the FBI or members of other families, and what the player does or says affects the outcome. While the enforcer\u0027s goal is to destroy the other families through brute force, the operator\u0027s is to blackmail the police chiefs of the five boroughs by finding enough \"dirt\" on them during missions. The player then blackmails the chiefs, enabling the bribe gauge to fill to the top for free every time the player talks to the chief, effectively allowing the player to take control of the police in that area. The police fight alongside the player\u0027s family members and can also arrest or kill rival family members. The path of the operator also grants the player additional tactical abilities that are not open to the enforcer, such as enhanced and regenerating health, the ability to call in the four-man hit squad twice as often, enhanced crew damages and health, ability to plant car bombs and make instant stealth kills, and reduced price on bribing on the police and FBI.",

Along with the new quests and area content, the team at Obsidian continues to support and make improvements to the entire game, including the additions of Player Party AI and Enhanced Enemy AI. Even if you haven\u0027t played Pillars of Eternity, now is a great time to jump in and experience the hardcore classic RPG with The White March - Part I. \n \nMain features \n-Raised level cap: Your party of six adventurers can now progress beyond level 12 to 14. The additional levels add powerful new spells, abilities and talents for all 11 classes. \n-New areas to explore: Largely focused on the snowy environments inspired by Icewind Dale, the expansion will feature a new quest hub, and many additional quests and dungeons. \n-Soulbound weapons: The expansion features mighty artifacts that grow stronger over time. These weapons gain different powers and attributes depending on the character class that binds to it. \n-New companions: Part 1 of the expansion introduces two new companions you will be able to use throughout all of your adventures. The Devil of Caroc, a rogue, and Zahua, a monk, will be available to join you on your quest in The White March and will travel back with you into the base game. \n-Multi-class talents: Classes will now have additional options to diversify and take on some of the abilities of other classes. \n-Party AI: Now you will have the option to set AI scripts for your party, allowing you to focus on controlling the characters you care about most. \n-Enhanced Enemy AI: Enemies and monsters are now smarter than ever. The new AI makes the entire game more of a challenge, and spell casters will use a wider variety of their spells in more devastating ways. \n-Respec: At any inn or tavern the player can re-level their party members. It gives flexibility for the player to experiment with the RPG systems and try out builds with the newly added multi-class talents. If you aren\u0027t completely satisfied with your character, you can now do a rebuild and start over fresh.",

You play both the Grinch and his faithful pooch, Max, in this creative adaptation. Much like the classic story, THE GRINCH takes place in the idyllic Whoville--where your aim is to cease the event called Christmas. You attempt to do so by wreaking havoc and solving challenging puzzles. The folks of Whoville will try to stop your efforts with love and happiness (blech!), so be on your toes if you hope to avoid them and effectively ruin the holiday. To make things a little easier, you can throw snowballs at the peacenik villagers to keep them at a distance. Each level will present new obstacles and challenges, and the Dr. Seuss world is faithfully translated to the video game format. Whether you\u0027re a genuine grouch or you\u0027re just in the mood for a great adventure, THE GRINCH is hilarious fun for everyone.",

    "summary": "Ghosts \u0027n Goblins is a platform game where the player controls a knight, named Sir Arthur, who must defeat zombies, ogres, demons, cyclops, dragons and other monsters in order to rescue Princess Prin Prin, who has been kidnapped by Satan, king of Demon World. Along the way the player can pick up new weapons, bonuses and extra suits of armor that can help in this task.\n\nThe game is often considered very difficult by arcade standards and is commonly regarded as one of the most difficult games ever released. The game is considered by Gametrailers.com to be the world\u0027s second most difficult game ever made. The player can only be hit twice before losing a life (the first hit takes away Arthur\u0027s armor, and the player must continue on in his underwear until completing the level, or finding replacement armor). If the player loses a life, he is returned to the start of the level, or the halfway point if he has managed to get that far. Furthermore, each life can only last a certain length of time (generally around three minutes), the clock being reset at the start of a level. If the clock does run out, the player instantly loses that life. After defeating the final boss, but only with the cross weapon (if the player does not have the cross weapon, they will be prompted that it is needed to defeat the boss and restart at the beginning of level 5 and must repeat round 5 and 6 again regardless if the weapon is obtained immediately or not) for the first time the player is informed that the battle was \"a trap devised by Satan\". The player must then replay the entire game on a higher difficulty level to reach the genuine final battle.",

In fact, even more information can be learned with a double-click! Every door, drawer, and cabinet can be opened with a right-click here and a right-click there, revealing more and more things to be learned! Packed to the brim with hundreds of native audio pronunciations (painstakingly recorded specifically for this game), Influent offers players a unique opportunity to enjoy learning both vocabulary and pronunciation in the language of their choice.\n\nWith 10 languages currently available for download, Influent combines the joys of playing a video game with the language learning process, resulting in real-life rewards and achievements that will remain with players for the rest of their lives.\n\nInfluent is a Language Learning Game focusing primarily on vocabulary acquisition and pronunciation. It was initially developed in Japan at the University of Tsukuba\u0027s Entertainment Computing Laboratory under the Monbukagakusho Government Research Scholarship.\n\nAfter research funding ran out, further funding from a wildly successful Kickstarter Campaign allowed for the completion of the game. A research paper on the ideas surrounding the game and its applications was published by the Information Processing Society of Japan (IPSJ), which can be viewed in its entirety here.",

At the center of this role-playing, action-adventure simulation of combat, statesmanship and intrigue, you are a samurai warrior struggling for Honor.

To succeed as a samurai, you must think like the samurai. Learn when to leave your sword in its sheath, when to draw it - and what to do with it once it’s drawn. You will fight duels, lead troops on the battlefields, and defend your family against assassins and kidnappers. If you are courageous and honorable, you may advance to become the head of your clan, and warlord of your province. If you master diplomacy and generalship, and outmaneuver your rivals, you may even become Shogun - absolute ruler of Japan. But remember that in all cultures power corrupts - and those who seek absolute power don’t always play by the rules.",

The expansion will move the game from Hope County to the sweltering jungles of the Vietnam War, where local boy Wendell \"Red\" Redler will embark upon a mission to rescued his captured comrades. \n \nThe expansion will add new weapons to the game, including the M16 rifle, the SVD sniper rifle, and the M60 machine gun, all of which will also be usable in the main campaign. You\u0027ll also have the ability to call in \"bombing airstrikes,\" which will presumably deliver more bang-for-the-buck than Hurk\u0027s mom\u0027s helicopter, and a new Survival Instinct feature that grants up to four temporary perks for accumulating stealth kills.",

In this latest edition, players can experience Ancient China\u0027s greatest and most glorious war as an all-powerful lord or as an officer. As a lord, gamers must think strategically. By deciding when to attack, when to resist invasion, or when to initiate policies, a lord can expand their power and influence. An easy-to-learn card collecting system lets players enact policies that will increase their empire\u0027s strength, improve the abilities of their forces, and more. The cards that a player receives will depend on the attributes of the officers and their army. Players can also pledge their allegiance to a kingdom to become an officer. As an officer, players can suggest policies in the kingdom\u0027s war council, complete missions for rewards, or even turn against their ruler should relations sour. Most eagerly awaited by fans is a game mode that allows players to create their own warrior. DYNASTY WARRIORS 6: Empires features an extensive character editing system with options to customize a warrior\u0027s gender, build, skin tone, facial features, voice, clothing, weapon and more. Whomever players choose to be, they can now use mountain ledges and waterways to infiltrate enemy bases and launch surprise attacks on supply depots to change the flow of battle.",

That\u0027s why there are new servers allowing them to rediscover the game as it was almost ten years ago.\n\nTwo 1.29 servers - Eratz and Henual - have always persisted. Historically, Ankama kept them so they wouldn\u0027t be unfairly disadvantaging their Latin American players, whose computers may not necessarily have been able to keep up with the performances required to enjoy DOFUS 2.0 to the fullest.

    "summary": "Your friends of the rock band Trip Cyclone win the Battle of the Bands and decide to make video clips in the secluded desert town of Cyclone, Arizona, located amidst the red rocks of Devil\u0027s Mouth Canyon. They stay at the house of aunt Pearl and help her out part-time in her cafe. The town seems to have gotten stuck in time decades ago, people are strange and not welcoming to outsiders. When two hikers do not return from their trip in the canyon, on which people believe an ancient Indian curse rests, the villagers set out for a search expedition, only to lose a local villager in the process. The town is restless, tourists stop coming and the band believes they may not be able to make their rock videos, lacking the money to buy equipment. Then they are approached by a strange man wearing a traditional Indian Kachina mask, who names himself Darkcloud.\n\nDarkcloud expresses strong interest in their music and decides to finance the band, even hiring a technician from LA. It is very suspicious but on the other hand the help is welcome. But then strange events begin - as their videos are broadcasted on the local TV network, people gradually turn into mental zombies, lured to Devil\u0027s Mouth Canyon. One by one they disappear. When the band witnessed more than they would like to, and they decide to pack their bags and leave town, a landslide occurs and virtually isolates Cyclone with no more supplies or people going in or out. People are trapped. Only one more person manages to make it to the town after a rough motorcycle ride - you. When you arrive, all people have disappeared, including your friends. What is going on here? Who is Darkcloud? And can you save your friends? Clues are scattered in their videos and in the buildings around the ghost town. Your friends\u0027 lives depend on your witts and puzzle-solving skills, Warrior.",

    "summary": "Eat Lead: The Return of Matt Hazard is a third-person shooter video game for the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 video game consoles. The game was developed by Vicious Cycle Software and published by D3 Publisher.\n\nEat Lead pits players in the role of the title character, a \"legendary\" gaming hero who is \"returning to glory\" in a new video game, some 25 years after his debut game and 6 years after his last game. In reality, the Matt Hazard character is in his first video game, with a history made up by D3 Publisher to chronicle the character\u0027s rise and fall in popularity. The Return of Matt Hazard marks Hazard\u0027s fictitious \"comeback\" to the gaming scene. Hazard is voiced by Will Arnett, while Neil Patrick Harris voices his nemesis Wallace \"Wally\" Wellesley.\n\nThe game itself is a parody of action-gaming clichés. The October 2008 debut trailer was done as a Behind the Music spoof called Inside the Game complete with Jim Forbes narration. It chronicles Matt Hazard\u0027s successes and hardships, and mirrors the progression of the Duke Nukem series of games, from early 8-bit to modern consoles.[1]\n\nThe cast of Eat Lead received a nomination in the 2009 Spike Video Game Awards, under the category for \"Best Cast\"",

The basic gameplay is nearly identical to the previous Kiseki series entries with a few changes. The biggest change to the battle system and also counting as a brand new feature is the \"Tactical Link System\". The \"Tactical Link\" allow players follow up with three different kinds of link attacks, dealing additional damage and providing various other benefits. \"Tactical Link\" becomes a more useful asset to the player as the story progress and characters level up their \"Link Levels\" with other characters. As the link levels increase, you will obtain new link abilities such as healing the link partner or increase the CP gain of the partner.",

Yoshi gets to bash and thrash his environment by throwing around Mega Eggdozers and Metal Eggdozers. Yoshi also can transform into a variety of objects, such as a jackhammer or a submarine, both of which can be manipulated using the Nintendo 3DS gyro controls. A certain type of star even transforms him into Super Yoshi, giving him the ability to fly through the sky or run along walls and ceilings. Players who are having trouble completing a level might see the appearance of Flutter Wings, which let Yoshi fly through the air.",

Sacred delivers a huge, elaborate world comprising 16 regions beset with heroic quests, battle-hardened warriors, and horrific enemies. Ancaria consists of highly detailed landscapes, complete with villages and towns, and also features a day/night cycle with varying weather systems. Regions vary from forests and mountains to deserts, catacombs, and ice-covered landmasses. More than three-quarters of the world is open to the players from the very start - no unlocks are needed. This is truly an epic RPG and enthralling storyline with over 30 main quests and 200 sub-quests and dynamic quests.\nChoose from eight heroic characters: Gladiator, Seraphim, Daemon, Dwarf, Wood Elf, Battlemage, Dark Elf, and Vampiress.\nUse hundreds of unique weapons, armors, and set items. Collect artifacts and forge all-powerful weapons!\nLearn Combat Arts, develop new skills, and customize devastating combo-attacks.\n\nSacred Plus incorporates all of the feedback from the player community since the first release of Sacred. This includes an optimized interface, and many completely new features: two new regions, two additional main quests, new item sets and weapons, and many new creature types which make adventuring in Ancaria even more dangerous.\n\nIn Sacred Underworld, Ancaria is facing a threat far greater than ever before. The now-familiar world continues to evolve, with existing Sacred players able to import their old characters into the Underworld.",

Simply passing through the region is unsafe, as travellers must be ever alert for ambushes.\n\nFour friends have joined together to aid their queen. Though destined to encounter ancient gods, primordial wonders, and marvellous inventions, foes and betrayal haunt their every step. A keen eye could prove vital, exposing essential clues. And as the companions make their way through darkness and light, they’ll discover that those two extremes have more in common than they once imagined...\n\nReal-time, bone-crunching combat with incredible spells and combos.Control any one of the four champions at any time, and skip between them at will.Customise each character\u0027s armour, weapons and spells and evolve new powerful attacks.",
