When trains reach a junction which is not set in a direction they can move through, they will stop until you move it. When they reach the wrong station they simply reverse and continue. If two trains make contact, they are lost, and a penalty is accrued.",

Because they’re adorable, and because video games.\n\nUurnog Uurnlimited is a delightfully silly 2D platformer inspired by games like Super Mario Bros. 2, Lyle in Cube Sector, and Dyad. Play single-player or co-op, explore the world through its many mysterious doors, solve puzzles and gather the items and animals needed in your Save Room. Careful though — the Save Room also saves your mistakes (urr nurr!)\n\nWhat else does it have, you ask? Chaotic neutral NPCs that can mess with your game! Algorithmic music that adapts to the gameplay! It’s uurnbelievable! It’s uurnexplainable! It’s Uurnog Uurnlimited!",

    "summary": "An updated and re-branded version of the original game.\n\n\"The long awaited DLC for GALAK-Z is finally upon us! We are rebranding GALAK-Z to reflect the update as well as to make it clear that the new content opens up a whole new way to play. With newly implemented Online Leaderboards, The Void game mode provides an endless playground for players to showcase their moment-to-moment survival skills and to post their scores as a challenge to friends and foes alike. GALAK-Z is all about honing one’s ability to dexterously pilot their ship and to strategically leverage the mech form to take on any set of enemies and environmental hazards. While GALAK-Z still has the narrative based procedurally generated Rogue and Arcade story modes, The Void focuses on the essence of GALAK-Z while providing an ever-escalating difficulty curve to challenge even the most skilled player. And to help encourage true competition, we have introduced the Daily Challenge that provides the same unique loadout and level layout seed for all who participate each and every day. Players can come back daily to see who will top the leaderboards.\"",

Newtonian physics take center stage as players experience finely-tuned control, blasting enemies, unleashing missile salvos, and tossing enemies into explosive obstacles. \n \nThe bar is raised for intense deep-space dogfighting with dynamic and life-like enemies, powered by the next generation Cyntient AI platform, developed by Cyntient Inc. Players will be forced to outmaneuver, outgun and outsmart enemies that think, react and cooperate like seasoned pilots. Both stealth and skill are required to defeat enemy squads in a brutal game of cat and mouse. Prepare for an enemy that comes alive like never before.\" \n \nThe game was later re-branded as Galak-Z: The Void with the released of a free DLC update for the game.",

For example you can play pickpocket, raid supermarkets and hotels, steal cars, raid banks, attack mail trains, and so on. Since you are in a big town you have many different opportunities for this. As soon as you have a high standing in the criminal underworld, you are also able to sign on gangsters that join your gang. This gangsters then can be trained or equipped with weapons (for example with pistols or machine guns). Your aim is to seize the power in the underworld. But the way is very dangerous, especially since the other players try exactly the same. And also the police are hard on your heels....",

He receives a vision that tells him to defeat the sorcerer Shandar. It is also possible to import a party of characters from the first Ishar. The game now takes place on an archipelago, each island bearing the name of one of Jarel\u0027s companions. Each island also features a different type of landscape: Irvan\u0027s island is covered with swamps, Akeer\u0027s and Otbar\u0027s are underground complexes, Zach\u0027s island is covered by a city, Jon\u0027s is mountainous, and Thorm\u0027s has treetop gangways in a forest.\n\nThis game has a combat system that\u0027s more ergonomic than in the first Ishar, and a day-night cycle in which shops are closed at night and the nightclub is closed by day. It also adds a bank (let\u0027s leave it to players to figure out what to do with it). Saving the game does not remove gold from the player any more.",

    "summary": "Ancient Wars: Sparta is a real-time strategy game in which the player controls the Spartans, the Ancient Egyptians and the Ancient Persians. The game is divided up into three separate campaigns, one for each of the three cultures, with each campaign divided into multiple missions. The campaigns are independent of one another, and can be played in any order. The missions within each campaign, however, are linear, and each mission only becomes available when the previous one has been completed. Although gameplay focuses primarily on combat, the game also features elements of economic micromanagement, as the player must generate enough resources to build up their armies to the point where they can defeat the opposing forces. Within each mission, the player will usually have multiple primary objectives, and will often have one or more secondary objectives. Secondary objectives are not necessary to complete the mission, but often reward the player with troops and/or resources if fulfilled.",

The game retains elements from previous games in the franchise including the use of multiple special weapons in order to fight enemies and absorb their energy to enhance the weaponry. This time the player primarily controls both Samanosuke and Jacques in separate scenarios. The two are able to exchange items in order to solve puzzles. The development from this game started after the release of the PlayStation 2 which allowed the team to work on a 3D engine to design 3D backgrounds. In order to appeal to the Western market, the team set this game in Paris and chose French actor Jean Reno to portray Jacques.\n\nOnimusha 3 has been generally well received by publications for video games. Most of the writer\u0027s praise focused on the improved controls and the use of a 3D engine that allowed better combat and visuals, respectively. The game also generated good sales with over 1.5 million copies sold as of May 2008.",

During the action players use the Wii Remote to direct objects and forces toward structures made of blocks in order to knock them over. There is also Jenga like gameplay during which players pull blocks, with the goal of toppling as many of them as possible, but without bringing down the whole structure. In doing this players have to deal with the different types of blocks in play. Some of these include: gem blocks, blocks with point values attached, explosive blocks that detonate on contact, vanishing blocks that disappear when struck, wood blocks, and steel blocks. In addition, as the game progresses strategies may change, meaning that players must be flexible in order to succeed.",

The Your Shape camera comes with the game and, using proprietary fitness tracking technology, scans you, giving you a full body shape analysis. The game combines that analysis with the results of your fitness test and your goals to create a personalized fitness program to help you meet your goals as efficiently and effectively as possible. Unlike any other fitness product, when you begin your workout, the camera projects your image onto the TV. Because the camera tracks your movements, your coach can give you real-time input on how you\u0027re doing and advice on how to do it better. And, you get all of these benefits without having to hold a controller as you workout, leaving your hands free to focus on the exercises. In fact, the game encourages you to incorporate your own exercise equipment (weights, balance ball, etc). Just tell it what you have at home, and your coach will add it to your personal workout. No other fitness product provides this level of personalization and interactivity while leaving your hands free.",

    "summary": "Link returns from The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess to pick up the Wii Zapper and take aim at a host of targets in this shooting-gallery-style game.\n\nAnyone can pick up the Wii Zapper and become a master marksman in the quick-play shooting galleries of Link\u0027s Crossbow Training. Dozens of fast-paced stages offer a wide variety of game play, from shooting stationary targets to defending a supply wagon from onrushing hordes of enemies. Multiplayer modes let players and their friends share a Wii Zapper to shoot for the high score.\n\nLink\u0027s Crossbow Training comes bundled with the Wii Zapper. After a few rounds of Link\u0027s Crossbow Training, players will be more than ready to pick up any of the future Wii Zapper titles, like Medal of Honor Heroes 2, Ghost Squad and Resident Evil: The Umbrella Chronicles.\n\nLink\u0027s Crossbow Training contains three basic game styles: target shooting, defender and ranger. There are 27 stages in total, and these categories represent only generally how each individual stage operates. Each stage\u0027s goal is to earn the highest score possible within the time limit. All rounds can be played with multiple players: Players pass the Wii Zapper around and then play one at a time and compete for the high score.\n\nTarget Shooting: In target-shooting rounds, players shoot bull\u0027s-eyes as they pop up on the screen. In early stages, targets are stationary. As the game difficulty increases in later levels, the targets move. Hitting the center of the bull\u0027s-eye nets more points, and hitting targets in succession without missing earns combo multipliers. Link can aim anywhere on the screen.\n\nDefender: In defender rounds, players remain stationary but can look and aim in all directions – sometimes even in a full 360 degrees – by aiming off screen. Hordes of enemies assault Link, and he must fight them off. These battles have a great deal of variety, from fighting off skeletons in a desert to defending a wagon from boar-riding Bokoblins.\n\nRanger: In ranger rounds, players can move throughout the level using the control stick and aim anywhere they want by aiming the Wii Zapper wherever they want to look. In these missions, Link storms enemy encampments, fights his way through a forest and seeks out his foes while exploring the environments.\n\nThe Wii Zapper requires the Wii Remote and Nunchuk, housing both in a comfortable and intuitive frame. The control stick on the Nunchuk controls player movement (on stages that allow player movement), while simply aiming the Wii Zapper moves the targeting reticule on the screen. Pulling the trigger fires Link\u0027s crossbow. By aiming off screen, players can turn Link to face in a new direction (again, on stages that allow this).",

The player\u0027s actions determine which characters will decide to help Jubei in his quest. These characters were added by the Capcom staff to give a bigger depth to the game and expand the game\u0027s feeling of adventure.",

Unfortunately, items gained during battles can\u0027t be sold.\n\nEach character levels up separately after defeating an enemy and, depending on how well the player fought during a battle, they can get rare items and extra gold. The game has 3 difficulty levels and the harder the difficulty level is, the more items the player can acquire after each battle. Some of the levels can be replayed to gain additional items and experience.\n\nThe game takes place in the kingdom of Belluna which is still healing from the scars of a civil war that took place a decade ago. The rookie knight Ogil and his childhood friend Fio fall witness to the assassination of the king of Belluna by rebellion soldiers from the neighboring Jerenia Republic. Despite losing the king and being torn between both sides of the conflict, the hero makes his own choices of what to fight for. However, the path the heroes have chosen will be filled with blood, darkness and significant changes to their beloved homeland."

It contains all the characters from the GameCube version, along with four exclusive to the PSP version: Blaze, Frost, Jax and Kitana. All characters have a vast arsenal of moves, with weapons, and fatalities. The arenas are multi-tiered, interactive and contain death traps. Next to the regular battles, you can play a free-roaming adventure in the Konquest Mode, battle an endless wave of opponents in the Endurance Mode (exclusive for the PSP), go head-to-head over Wi-Fi against another human player, or try a mini-game such as Chess Kombat (chess with the MK characters) and Puzzle Kombat (Tetris with a twist).",

However, the real tale begins many centuries later after the Silver Dragon reawakens, and launches an assault on a frontier village in the far north. There, a royal knight by the name of Lucas serves as a guard after being relegated to the rural and much isolated location by the King. Yet, little does he know he is, in fact, a descendant of the hero, Alaric, who once sealed the Gold and Silver Dragons in human form. Nonetheless, when tragedy strikes, he soon finds his place, and after teaming up with a band of unlikely companions, sets out on an adventure to save the world.",

The game\u0027s plot depends on which mission is completed as well as subsequent playable levels. The game stars Shadow the Hedgehog and his quest to recover his memory, a goal he has been pursuing since his debut in Sonic Adventure 2, while an evil alien race known as the Black Arms is invading the planet.",

At its heart, the game is about the player living in a small town and communicating with the other villagers while raising livestock, harvesting crops, and building a farm.\nAside from laying out fields and deciding where to herd the animals, players must also pay attention to the placement of their resources, arranging their life as they see fit. As a special feature unique to the DS, interaction with others is a major part of the game. One can even court, date and marry.\n\nIt\u0027s just one goal in a game filled with things to do and people to meet. The game is beautifully animated in a Japanese anime style. The open-ended gameplay styles mean the player can choose what they want to do whether it be breed animals, farm their fields, build relationships with the people around town or any combination of these activities as well as many others.\nThe DS allows for unique touch screen controls that are implemented into most of the in-game activities. With so many different activities and open-ended style simulation gameplay, there are hours and hours of entertainment available to players.",

Whereas in Dynasty Warriors, however, Koei focuses on ancient Chinese history, Devil Kings focuses more on feudal Japan, but with a fictional setting with the ability to use modern day weapons such as chain guns and shotguns as well as fighting legendary and fictional characters from the past.\n\nThe story takes place as the Devil King, a king possessed by the soul of the Devil, has unleashed an unholy army on the world to bend it to his will as the player must stop him along with many of his minions including his wife Lady Butterfly, his general the Red Minotaur, as well as loyal assassins Scorpio and Venus.\n\nThe gameplay is more arcade hack-and-slash style, with the ability of using magic spells to wipe out entire waves of enemies and as mentioned before, the ability to use modern day weapons along with historical weapons such as spears, swords among others. There are six playable characters to use as well, each with their own story told in CG and anime cutscenes as well as two modes of play, Conquest (the main story of the game) and Free Mode (where players can play in any unlocked stage they have completed).",

There is a clandestine group, under the guise of scholarly research, plotting to resurrect a goddess whose time has long since passed. To achieve this goal, they need two things; a vessel of flesh and blood to house the spirit of the goddess, and the lives of every living being offered up as a sacrifice. It is against the backdrop of this coming chaos that Ares, an orphan from a small, forgotten village, sets out to seek his fortune as an adventurer. At the start of his journey, he encounters a beautiful young girl with mysterious powers named Shiera, who has not only lost her memories about herself, but also of the world around her. Together, they embark on an adventure that will ultimately decide the fate of the entire world. Ragnarok Online, the international massively multiplayer online (MMO) phenomenon, now comes to the Nintendo DS. With over three million registered users in North America, Ragnarok DS brings the same addictive game play of exploration and customization to a handheld platform, giving the huge number of online PC players the next best thing when they are unable to log into their regular Ragnarok Online account from a computer.",

Unlike other games if this genre, almost the entire game is composed of boss battles, each boss requiring a different strategy to defeat.\n\nThe game also uses a unique in-game difficulty adjuster. Called \"fields\", you can play in either Order or Chaos. Compared to Order, the Chaos Field offers you increased fire power and abilities, but also does the same for your enemies. Order Field is more relaxed on both sides. If you can play in the Chaos Field, you stand to gain substantially more points.",

The story takes place near the Keep of Cyan, a northern part of this world. The game\u0027s goal is to win the election and become the Lord of the Keep. In order to do so, the player character has to persuade at least 4 of 9 guilds to aid him. Only then the character will have a chance to fight his nemesis, the Masked Man - a mysterious mage who uses a small army of creatures to conquer the Keep. On his journeys, the player character also has to reveal the mystery of his own nature and past. An unknown ally of great power also helps the character by granting him a sentient magical weapon with a friendly personality. The player could enlist help from two of four NPCs who traveled with him before the beginning of the game.",

    "summary": "Mario Super Sluggers, the sequel to Mario Superstar Baseball, continues the arcade-style gameplay of Mario sports games. Mario and friends are invited to the Baseball Kingdom to play games against each other. When Bowser hears this, he immediately interrupts the party.\n\nThere are several game modes to choose from like in the previous game. In Exhibition mode, players play a single game against each other. Players can choose different options such as how many innings to play, if captains can use star powers (each captain has a different star swing and pitch), and toggle error items off and on (error items can be thrown at fielders).\n\nThe single-player Challenge mode is different this time around. Instead of choosing a team captain, players start with Mario who must find teammates to take on Bowser Jr. and Bowser. Teammates aren\u0027t unlocked by playing a game rather they only join the team by clearing certain objectives. Most of the action takes place on areas with an overhead perspective; each area is based around a team captain. Each captain has a special ability to find teammates and coins, which are used to buy items to aid in the quest or in a game against Bowser Jr. or later against Bowser. More coins can be gotten in minigames.\n\nToy Field mode is slightly different to the one featured in Mario Superstar Baseball. Like in the GameCube game, players take turns batting to get points; a turn is granted to whomever grabs and holds the ball after a certain amount of time has passed. Unlike in the previous game, however, fielders can attack each other to steal the ball away from whomever has it. The batter can also throw items at the fielders to cause them to drop the ball and grant the batter another turn.",

Super Bonk allows Bonk to travel through time from his prehistoric levels, the insides of a dinosaur, a version of modern Chinatown, and even the moon! Along the way, Bonk can find power-ups that can change his form to creatures such as a shooting Bonk crab, a dinosaur form called \"Big Kronk\", find candies that change his size from tiny to huge, travel through transportation tubes, and find multiple bonus levels.\n\nBonk still uses his head to smash his enemies, propeller seeds that allow Bonk to fly, and for the first time, can carry spring flowers on his head in his continuing battle against his arch nemesis, King Drool!",

The people of the Borrius region summoned a dark force to help them defeat their enemies; however, the war ended in defeat when the king of the Kalos region unleashed the ultimate weapon.

    "summary": "James Bond 007: Agent Under Fire is the first James Bond game to appear on the PlayStation 2, GameCube, and Xbox. The game casts the player as the legendary James Bond who must accomplish missions throughout different areas of the world. Bond is sent on a mission rescue Zoe Nightshade, a CIA agent in the hands of Nigel Bloch. Nigel Bloch is the CEO of Identicon, a section of a highly successful industry company known as Malprave industries. Bond is also tasked to retrieve the set of DNA samples that are in Identicon\u0027s hands. So James Bond sets off on another adventure... \n \nThe game combines three game modes into one package: first-person-shooter, which is what most of the missions are, a rail-shooter, where the player only controls firing, and a driving game, where the player drives one of the many Bond cars. Numerous weapons have been added to the series, along with some fictional weapons like the Photon cannon and the 5-way grenade launcher. The player can utilize a wide array of gadgets and weapons, like the Q-Claw, Q-Decoder, and Bond\u0027s trusty Walther handgun. There is a large variety of missions, and Bond can go through most missions with weapons, or take a stealthy approach. The player is also rated in each level, based on score and difficulty level, and can unlock new features for both single and multiplayer.",
