Also many instances such as Poets Palace and Shimmering Citadel are available with Desert of Flames.","tags":[17,38,268435468,536871208,536871376,536871422,536871504,536871613,536871812,536871938,536872070,536872978,536873326,536874134,536874830,536875044,536875091,536875169,536875770,536875778,536875799,536876021,536876273,536876537,536876554,536876583,536876606,536876607,536876624,536876625,536876816,536876895,536876897,536876981,536876991,536877040,536877165,536877210,536877296,536877301,536877394,536877428,536877438,536877509,536877593,536877595,536877597,536877612,536877653,536877776,536877819,536877870,536877907,536877915,536877965,536878073,536878322,536878352,536878410,536878417,536878473,536878517,536878523,536878524,536878558,536878603,536879070,536879154,536879201,536879769,536879821,536879999,536880259,536880479,536880579,536880833,536880834,536880846,536880907,536880925,536880931,536880932,536880933,536880934,536880935,536880936,536880937,536880938,536880939,536880940,536880941,536880978,536881024,536881026,536881078,536881122,536881260,536881662,536882060,536882197,536882198,536882202,536882229,536882376,536882427,536882484,536882496,536882791,536883145,536883238,536883302,536883339,536883373,536883419,536883420,536883422,536883423,536883426,536883429,536883432,536883515,536883960,536884021],"videos":[{"id":7454,"video_id":"MShhtj06VZc"}]},{"id":199167,"name":"Breakout Bricks","platforms":[{"id":48,"name":"PlayStation 4"}],"screenshots":[{"id":782606,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scgrv2.jpg"},{"id":782607,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scgrv3.jpg"},{"id":782608,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scgrv4.jpg"},{"id":782609,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scgrv5.jpg"}]},{"id":56149,"cover":{"id":31293,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/hwlj0dquqy3uchcpi0gw.jpg"},"name":"Taco Run","platforms":[{"id":48,"name":"PlayStation 4"},{"id":167,"name":"PlayStation 5"}],"screenshots":[{"id":782417,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scgrpt.jpg"},{"id":782418,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scgrpu.jpg"},{"id":782419,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scgrpv.jpg"},{"id":782420,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scgrpw.jpg"},{"id":782421,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scgrpx.jpg"},{"id":782422,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scgrpy.jpg"},{"id":782423,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scgrpz.jpg"},{"id":782424,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scgrq0.jpg"},{"id":782425,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scgrq1.jpg"},{"id":782426,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scgrq2.jpg"}],"summary":"Take actor Danny Trejo on a journey to collect tacos and taco ingredients.","tags":[268435464,536872287,536872525,536872961,536873300,536875046,536875073,536875139,536875220,536875290,536875684,536876373,536877348,536878052]},{"id":24041,"aggregated_rating":66.6666666666667,"cover":{"id":17439,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/zpydiwem3hijcgb0a0fq.jpg"},"name":"Gravity Error","platforms":[{"id":6,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"},{"id":14,"name":"Mac"},{"id":48,"name":"PlayStation 4"}],"screenshots":[{"id":83025,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/vt0eopym93zl6vosqgl3.jpg"},{"id":83026,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/ezd4o768etstocevtou5.jpg"},{"id":83027,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/gc7ecsturvmlkhaohv8j.jpg"},{"id":83028,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/slasme71svuroinpusee.jpg"},{"id":83029,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/wfcwqwlzm0mxk4kvqwj1.jpg"}],"summary":"Gravity Error is an indie 2D puzzle/platformer about changing gravity.

As a bonus, King's Bounty was also included on the CD.","tags":[17,268435468,268435471,268435472,536871123,536871138,536871139,536871172,536871208,536871213,536871327,536871390,536871409,536871865,536871938,536872074,536872098,536872291,536872352,536872449,536872471,536872622,536872898,536873064,536873311,536873364,536873822,536874345,536874694,536874743,536874745,536874830,536874834,536875042,536875095,536875130,536875160,536875214,536875232,536875304,536875307,536875314,536875361,536875419,536875455,536875488,536875523,536875531,536875537,536875639,536875679,536875699,536875775,536875778,536875791,536875792,536875855,536875870,536875901,536875941,536875956,536876057,536876083,536876281,536876282,536876285,536876348,536876413,536876590,536876606,536876706,536876847,536876986,536877211,536877432,536877453,536877568,536878073,536878338,536878442,536879058,536879217,536880645,536880745,536880854,536881181,536881452,536882130,536882496],"videos":[{"id":5820,"video_id":"cowyllTqkV0"}]},{"id":22395,"cover":{"id":72166,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co1jom.jpg"},"name":"Boundary","platforms":[{"id":6,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"},{"id":48,"name":"PlayStation 4"}],"screenshots":[{"id":30125,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/clvj7qbsq7c973hn1jti.jpg"},{"id":30126,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/hrh5apo0edf9gfpnareb.jpg"},{"id":30127,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/jvivkfutcxnkmehvotgd.jpg"},{"id":30128,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/wtw0bjlyimtuwilojdbl.jpg"},{"id":30129,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/m4ojpxnuchtiygomwkb3.jpg"}],"summary":"A multiplayer tactical space-based shooter that puts players in the role of a heavily armed astronauts in space engaging in fierce zero gravity firefights.

While the options are fantastic and the graphics are gorgeous, the playbook is a layperson's nightmare - and game control is extremely frustrating. College football fans just shouldn't have to come so close, yet still be so far.... \n \nFirst, the good news: GameBreaker will be a treat for college football fans, whose games usually play second-fiddle to the bigger, badder NFL slamfests. GameBreaker runs on the new, improved GameDay engine, and has the options and small touches to bring out the school spirit in anyone. Then there's all those teams, displayed in fantastic motion-captured graphics. And let's not forget the abundant animation capped off with excellent pep band music and an echoing announcer's voice. In short, this game is simply gorgeous. It's easily the best-looking college football game anywhere. \n \nWait, sit back down. \n \nGameBreaker is knocked out of the game thanks to its atrocious playbook interface. There's little doubt the designers meant well when they compiled the mother lode of all playbooks. But the options are so numerous (and so spread out) that it's far too difficult to find the right play for the right situation. Even the special teams section is hidden, meaning there's no choice but to cycle through the entire menu to find it. With seconds left and no time outs, the last thing anyone wants to do is peruse the playbook. Simple features could have made play selection so much easier: For example, on fourth down, the special teams box could (and should) have been front and center. And if that isn't enough.... \n \nGameBreaker's got a tough one-player game - one so hard that even an experienced thumb-back can end up losing to the worst teams on the easiest level. This fact is largely attributable to the computer's ability to instantly find the perfect play and perfectly execute it (complete with precisely-timed stiff-arms). This may present a great challenge for the experienced, but players new to console football won't enjoy it at all...and with four difficulty settings to choose from, this is inexcusable. \n \nThis all adds up to put college football fans in a tough spot: There're plenty of frills, but no gameplay. College football freaks will enjoy this game despite the tough interface and gameplay. But first-timers (and NFL mavens used to the easy handling of GameDay, Quarterback Club, and even Madden) won't like what they find. Simply put, this game's not ready for the big leagues. --Hugh Sterbakov \n--Copyright ©1999 GameSpot Inc. All rights reserved.

On a stormy night, Princess Zelda and the shrine maidens fear that the reason for these events is that Vaati's seal is weakening. She summons Link and brings him to the castle so he can protect her and the other maidens while they open the portal to the Four Sword Sanctuary. When they do, however, a shadowy figure appears from the portal. This figure was Shadow Link, who then kidnapped the shrine maidens and sealed them in crystals. Link follows him to the sanctuary where he retrieves the Four Sword to destroy this doppelganger. The Four Sword is a magical sword that splits the wielder into three clones of himself. Vaati is once again released and wreaks havoc on the once peaceful kingdom.","tags":[1,17,268435487,536871139,536871208,536871384,536871613,536871727,536871758,536871889,536871945,536872093,536872201,536872232,536872291,536872293,536872425,536872589,536872690,536872957,536873066,536873111,536873384,536873454,536873508,536874225,536874398,536874745,536875056,536875262,536875304,536875305,536875308,536875337,536875362,536875375,536875396,536875499,536875537,536875606,536875610,536875611,536875637,536875639,536875699,536875741,536875745,536875758,536875778,536875791,536875803,536875830,536875870,536876100,536876492,536876499,536876528,536876715,536876974,536877050,536877064,536877090,536877104,536877114,536877208,536877453,536877721,536877727,536877734,536877735,536877780,536877800,536878127,536878129,536878130,536878131,536878139,536878361,536878468,536878507,536880113,536880114,536880118,536880285,536880441,536880477,536880512,536880755,536880863,536882443,536882952,536882955,536882957,536882958,536882959,536882960,536882961,536884022,536885901,536887087,536887088,536900719,536900725,536900727],"videos":[{"id":29123,"video_id":"1AZMO5iBeDg"}]},{"id":660,"cover":{"id":82219,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co1rfv.jpg"},"name":"Darkstone","platforms":[{"id":6,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"},{"id":7,"name":"PlayStation"}],"screenshots":[{"id":92728,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/slwes67gfre5du03wjwk.jpg"},{"id":92729,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/ns9rkfouejsiubcd9tga.jpg"},{"id":92730,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sgqyx9y5b4ryke2dwfvl.jpg"},{"id":92731,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/cpiivxwamnjfsjs4rspx.jpg"},{"id":92732,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/cdofelyzblvccrncrtyi.jpg"}],"summary":"Lord Draak's henchmen are spreading chaos in Uma.

Under a certain amount of duress... Jack takes on a job, which will not only cause him a great deal of trouble, but also bring to light the answer to a mystery out of his distant past. A lack of money leads Jack to accept a charter to take a British secret agent to mysterious 'Tooth Island'. When Jack's ship shatters on the mysterious island's cliffs on arrival and the secret agent quickly becomes a meal for a monster in the jungle, Jack is soon left to cope with the situation on his own. \n \nTooth Island is ruled by the strange Doctor T, who is cultivating man-eating plants and has his own dastardly plans for the British Empire. And why does he seem to know Jack, who can't remember ever having been on Tooth Island? What are Doctor T's plans? And what does he know about Jack's past? \n \nAnd then there's the young and naive Amanda, who is filled by an almost fanatical drive to prove her worth. In the beginning the young lady is employed by Doctor T, and part of her task is to track Jack down and take him prisoner. It doesn't take long before she begins to wonder if she is really on the right side, or if she shouldn't join her opponent, the charming Captain Jack, instead. \n \nA hair-raising hunt across the length and breadth of the dangerous island finally airs the mystery surrounding Jack's past and leads to a spectacular showdown with a dark and deadly enemy and his nefarious henchmen.","tags":[1,27,268435468,268435487,536871262,536871271,536871456,536871939,536872070,536872328,536872435,536873027,536875046,536875199,536875228,536875229,536875271,536875281,536875420,536875440,536875523,536875531,536875700,536875792,536875808,536876210,536876274,536876499,536876617,536877907,536880294,536883035]},{"id":11193,"aggregated_rating":71.3636363636364,"cover":{"id":172506,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co3p3u.jpg"},"name":"Hyrule Warriors: Legends","platforms":[{"id":37,"name":"Nintendo 3DS"}],"screenshots":[{"id":10517,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/eaxoh3swjrzt9ambsgi9.jpg"},{"id":10518,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/nehecgjd0zgudgeu7wht.jpg"},{"id":10519,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/jlcph370fpwmem4t8rlq.jpg"},{"id":10520,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/uyrvoe3z8uuhcuxmjyxd.jpg"},{"id":10521,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/m7mrtu3oldvynladq5h7.jpg"},{"id":161604,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/lnmh1vp2byzz0mzdyyxg.jpg"},{"id":161605,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/ug64vzmxgdem566ye4h2.jpg"},{"id":161606,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/udjqncayuut8ychbbxxe.jpg"},{"id":161607,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/lhnxvxw3rxo0julazlyp.jpg"},{"id":161608,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/ohm5ipv1udd6c6bohaw0.jpg"},{"id":161609,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sldjktpvak9c7wwi0lk9.jpg"},{"id":161610,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/y79ak9omvdsz0ngevsrh.jpg"}],"summary":"Cut down entire legions of enemies using over-the-top powerful Dynasty Warriors\n-style moves as Hyrule Warriors comes to the Nintendo 3DS family of systems.

It is the first entry in the Guitar Hero series. Guitar Hero was released in November 2005 in North America, April 2006 in Europe and June 2006 in Australia. The game's development was a result of collaboration between RedOctane and Harmonix to bring a Guitar Freaks-like game to United States. \n \nThe game features a guitar-shaped controller (resembling a miniature Gibson SG) that the player uses to simulate playing rock music. The gameplay is similar to GuitarFreaks, in that the player presses buttons on the guitar controller in time with musical notes that scroll on the game screen. The game features covers of 30 popular rock songs spanning five decades of rock, from the 1960s up through 2005, in addition to bonus tracks. Guitar Hero became a surprise hit, earning critical acclaim and winning many awards from major video game publications, and was considered one of the most influential games of the first decade of the 21st century. The game's success launched the Guitar Hero franchise, which has earned more than $2 billion in sales, spawning several sequels, expansions, and other game-related products.","tags":[268435463,536871080,536871081,536871400,536871457,536871577,536871627,536873064,536873847,536875049,536875122,536875123,536875245,536875300,536875364,536875751,536875766,536875822,536875941,536876100,536876101,536876102,536876348,536876799,536878071,536878198,536880245,536880316,536880985,536881516,536881598],"videos":[{"id":3758,"video_id":"E8JYB2uiUe0"}]},{"id":25252,"aggregated_rating":60.0,"cover":{"id":205397,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co4ehh.jpg"},"name":"Crush Crush","platforms":[{"id":3,"name":"Linux"},{"id":6,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"},{"id":14,"name":"Mac"},{"id":34,"name":"Android"},{"id":82,"name":"Web browser"}],"screenshots":[{"id":33663,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/nwgno6af0ngx97ovga05.jpg"},{"id":33664,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/vjo5tqlt4sljgwpdavbp.jpg"},{"id":33665,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/z99shsvez5se3uqhtl2v.jpg"},{"id":33666,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/nwfanmfbp6rbgfgzaavn.jpg"},{"id":33667,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/mr3iyvwxp6bv6im6sgyp.jpg"}],"summary":"Welcome to Crush Crush - the Idle Dating Sim!

edge.","tags":[1,17,268435481,268435487,536870991,536871041,536871088,536871133,536871139,536871208,536871213,536871301,536871470,536871496,536871506,536871542,536871626,536871791,536871878,536871931,536871945,536872010,536872014,536872064,536872092,536872105,536872114,536872140,536872201,536872205,536872211,536872270,536872334,536872406,536872415,536872511,536872587,536872626,536872647,536872695,536872715,536872810,536872873,536872981,536873017,536873021,536873053,536873066,536873249,536873352,536873362,536873712,536873810,536874398,536874706,536874727,536874743,536874906,536874916,536875050,536875058,536875059,536875062,536875073,536875081,536875083,536875085,536875095,536875098,536875099,536875100,536875111,536875125,536875128,536875154,536875157,536875178,536875192,536875199,536875200,536875206,536875215,536875223,536875229,536875244,536875245,536875250,536875257,536875265,536875271,536875275,536875286,536875298,536875301,536875305,536875309,536875315,536875322,536875326,536875327,536875330,536875340,536875344,536875358,536875362,536875364,536875396,536875421,536875432,536875437,536875456,536875460,536875480,536875483,536875488,536875490,536875492,536875493,536875495,536875498,536875501,536875502,536875503,536875504,536875508,536875511,536875523,536875524,536875525,536875527,536875532,536875534,536875535,536875537,536875538,536875545,536875546,536875547,536875549,536875550,536875554,536875557,536875565,536875570,536875572,536875593,536875609,536875638,536875639,536875649,536875650,536875665,536875668,536875682,536875700,536875741,536875743,536875744,536875745,536875746,536875777,536875778,536875781,536875782,536875792,536875803,536875819,536875822,536875855,536875870,536875880,536875885,536875889,536875896,536875903,536875910,536875912,536875913,536875914,536875934,536875941,536875954,536876008,536876017,536876018,536876023,536876028,536876029,536876031,536876034,536876058,536876068,536876070,536876073,536876076,536876083,536876084,536876096,536876097,536876098,536876099,536876125,536876171,536876178,536876185,536876186,536876196,536876197,536876199,536876210,536876211,536876257,536876262,536876266,536876273,536876275,536876276,536876277,536876299,536876302,536876319,536876321,536876322,536876332,536876333,536876337,536876340,536876342,536876343,536876344,536876351,536876353,536876358,536876378,536876423,536876434,536876446,536876447,536876466,536876474,536876502,536876504,536876524,536876526,536876528,536876546,536876552,536876569,536876599,536876603,536876607,536876608,536876612,536876617,536876654,536876699,536876703,536876711,536876712,536876719,536876723,536876724,536876735,536876756,536876762,536876797,536876803,536876809,536876819,536876821,536876827,536876832,536876833,536876887,536876910,536876934,536876961,536876974,536877047,536877054,536877057,536877077,536877151,536877169,536877170,536877176,536877180,536877181,536877253,536877275,536877280,536877323,536877326,536877332,536877333,536877346,536877363,536877369,536877373,536877386,536877403,536877443,536877445,536877531,536877532,536877537,536877560,536877583,536877628,536877650,536877672,536877742,536877755,536877758,536877764,536877780,536877854,536877889,536877905,536877907,536877942,536877954,536877955,536877956,536877957,536877987,536877990,536878008,536878037,536878101,536878142,536878228,536878298,536878315,536878415,536878425,536878515,536879041,536879188,536879764,536879886,536879957,536879992,536880050,536880217,536880360,536880438,536880445,536880466,536880677,536880691,536880863,536880864,536880921,536880965,536881675,536882423,536882654,536882809,536882820,536882936,536883336,536883343,536883344,536888127,536891654,536891655],"videos":[{"id":825,"video_id":"nuLfqGdWEXI"},{"id":1049,"video_id":"jccTX6Q-s28"}]},{"id":159073,"cover":{"id":161648,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co3gq8.jpg"},"name":"The

The game was released in North America on the PlayStation 3, Wii, and Xbox 360 on March 29, 2009 and on PlayStation 2 on April 14, 2009, with an Australian and European release in May 2009. Guitar Hero: Metallica is the second game of the Guitar Hero series to focus on the career and songs of one band following Guitar Hero: Aerosmith. \n \nThe game is based on Guitar Hero World Tour, with support for lead and bass guitar, drums, and vocals. The game has many of the same features from World Tour, including single-player and band Career modes, online competitive modes, and the ability to create and share songs through \"GHTunes\". In addition to the normal difficulty levels presented in Guitar Hero World Tour, Guitar Hero: Metallica provides an \"Expert+\" difficulty for drums that allows the use of a second bass drum pedal to match the drumming style of Metallica's Lars Ulrich. The game features 28 master recordings spanning Metallica's career and an additional 21 songs selected by members of Metallica. The band performed extensive motion capture for the game for their in-game avatars and performances. The game includes several extras including behind-the-scenes videos of the motion capture sessions, tour and concert videos of the band, and Pop-Up Video-like facts for many of the songs on the game disc. \n \nGuitar Hero: Metallica received positive reviews, with critics stating it to be a strong tribute to the band and Neversoft's best work on the Guitar Hero series to date. The difficulty throughout the game was praised, found to be more enjoyable to players of all skill levels than the more-difficult Guitar Hero III: Legends of Rock. Reviewers noted the lack of additional downloadable content, save for the pre-existing Death Magnetic songs, the cartoonish storyline for the Career mode, and the overall value of the game as some of the negatives to the experience.","tags":[268435463,536871400,536871577,536871627,536872205,536872245,536872594,536872964,536873064,536873455,536873847,536875049,536875054,536875139,536875157,536875199,536875215,536875244,536875245,536875271,536875362,536875364,536875486,536875609,536875610,536875751,536875781,536875802,536875896,536875943,536876101,536876102,536876171,536876199,536876703,536876719,536876799,536876948,536877028,536877187,536877275,536877664,536877985,536878071,536878193,536878239,536878395,536879750,536880245,536880266,536881263,536881598,536882368,536882865,536883103,536883779,536884932,536884933],"videos":[{"id":33060,"video_id":"nSTUVEsUBG4"},{"id":33061,"video_id":"PZL1pEUiooY"}]},{"id":72883,"cover":{"id":123261,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co2n3x.jpg"},"name":"Chocolatier 2: Secret Ingredients","platforms":[{"id":6,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}],"summary":"Another simple trading game where players buy chocolate materials and create and sell finished chocolate.

Fenris was once Odin's watchdog and ran away. Ever since he became aware of his growing power and strength he has been terrifying the underground world. Fenris must be disarmed and put on a chain. This task requires a very special chain, a chain that can only be forged by the Diggles...\n\nAccomplishing this dangerous mission will take decades and involved many generations of dwarves. During their journey the dwarves have to pass through 4 different worlds and more than 100 different quests have to be solved. The player has to arrange a daily schedule for the dwarves by determining how much they work and what they do in their leisure time. The player has to teach them how to forge weapons, cook mushrooms, raise hamsters, produce tools and invent machines. Like people in real life, the dwarves also want to have some spare time in order to sleep, eat, play cards, go bowling or to a pub. Male and female Diggles can even fall in love with each other and thus conceive their offspring, which ensures the survival of their clan and can transmit their learned attributes to their dwarf children. The player's most important goal is to prepare the Diggles for the crucial fight with Fenris.","tags":[17,27,268435467,268435471,268435487,536871162,536871208,536871262,536871279,536871865,536871906,536872383,536874694],"videos":[{"id":64851,"video_id":"BtYOTSY-kDY"}]},{"id":121089,"cover":{"id":185054,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co3yse.jpg"},"name":"Saboteur II: Avenging Angel","platforms":[{"id":48,"name":"PlayStation 4"},{"id":130,"name":"Nintendo Switch"}],"screenshots":[{"id":324442,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc6yca.jpg"},{"id":324443,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc6ycb.jpg"},{"id":324444,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc6ycc.jpg"},{"id":324445,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc6ycd.jpg"},{"id":324446,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc6yce.jpg"},{"id":324447,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc6ycf.jpg"}],"summary":"Saboteur II: Avenging Angel is the second part of the classic retro game hit Saboteur! made by Clive Townsend in 1987.

(Discworld II: Mortality Bytes! in North America) is the second point-and-click adventure game based on Terry Pratchett's series of fantasy novels set on the mythical Discworld. The game was developed and produced in 1996 by Perfect Entertainment for the PC, and ported in 1997 for the PlayStation and Sega Saturn. It was published by Psygnosis for the PC and PlayStation, and by Sega for the Saturn (only in Europe).\n\nIn Discworld II the player controls Rincewind the \"wizzard\" (voiced by Eric Idle, as in the previous game) who has been burdened with the task of coercing Death out of his impromptu retirement and back into his regular duties. The plot borrows from a number of Discworld books, most notably Reaper Man, Moving Pictures and Lords and Ladies.\n\nIt all begins in a quiet Ankh-Morpork street, where Rincewind and The Librarian inexplicably fail to die from a nearby cart-bomb explosion. The odd event is not shared by them alone however: occurrences of the newly dead re-awakening and disturbing the populace are being reported all over the city, prompting the Archchancellor of Unseen University to halt his usual activities of feasting and merrymaking, and to take charge of the situation. Much to Rincewind's despair, the entirety of this process involves appointing him to the task of finding Death and convincing him to resume his work.","tags":[17,27,268435458,268435487,536871041,536871059,536871123,536871138,536871262,536871470,536871535,536871755,536871939,536872092,536872232,536872328,536872746,536874134,536875229,536875243,536875280,536875319,536875327,536875449,536875699,536875792,536876006,536876126,536876694,536877903,536878073,536878377,536878510,536878531,536879065,536879765,536881428,536882271,536882467,536883812]},{"id":84998,"cover":{"id":61394,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/w8gl5pp2fprcqso09u1y.jpg"},"name":"Blocky Bot","platforms":[{"id":41,"name":"Wii U"}],"screenshots":[{"id":153416,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/eny1uuq9c6mdtljidnol.jpg"},{"id":153417,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/fhcnwyze3uhy2dho44d2.jpg"},{"id":153418,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/jjvtp7v0xguvsyyj1aoc.jpg"},{"id":153419,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/im1gig2edhlliuksundy.jpg"}],"summary":"Super 3D Platform Mini Arcade Action!"},{"id":43029,"cover":{"id":157144,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co3d94.jpg"},"name":"Call of Duty Classic","platforms":[{"id":9,"name":"PlayStation 3"},{"id":12,"name":"Xbox 360"}],"screenshots":[{"id":413805,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc8val.jpg"},{"id":413806,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc8vam.jpg"},{"id":413807,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc8van.jpg"}],"summary":"Call of Duty Classic is a downloadable version of Call of Duty for Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3.\nIt is an enhanced port of the original game featuring HD resolutions.
