The player controls Pac-Man through a maze, eating pac-dots (also called pellets or just dots). When all pac-dots are eaten, Pac-Man is taken to the next stage. Four enemies (Blinky, Pinky, Inky and Clyde) roam the maze, trying to catch Pac-Man. If an enemy touches Pac-Man, a life is lost and the Pac-Man itself withers and dies. When all lives have been lost, the game ends. Near the corners of the maze are four larger, flashing dots known as power pellets that provide Pac-Man with the temporary ability to eat the enemies. The enemies turn deep blue, reverse direction and usually move more slowly. When an enemy is eaten, its eyes remain and return to the center box where it is regenerated in its normal color. Blue enemies flash white to signal that they are about to become dangerous again and the length of time for which the enemies remain vulnerable varies from one stage to the next, generally becoming shorter as the game progresses.","tags":[1,21,268435465,268435471,268435489,536870928,536871251,536871306,536871470,536871599,536871872,536872070,536872205,536872349,536872352,536872594,536872617,536873064,536873328,536873390,536873590,536873787,536873991,536874611,536874694,536875046,536875056,536875060,536875074,536875075,536875081,536875096,536875118,536875119,536875120,536875151,536875200,536875209,536875312,536875350,536875396,536875397,536875404,536875434,536875435,536875453,536875517,536875523,536875525,536875607,536875639,536875661,536875666,536875691,536875781,536875802,536875830,536875837,536875870,536875942,536876005,536876008,536876087,536876120,536876177,536876272,536876329,536876354,536876362,536876435,536876545,536876557,536876559,536876642,536876656,536876657,536876658,536876659,536876713,536876714,536876715,536876716,536876718,536876930,536877277,536877402,536877417,536877940,536878192,536879012,536879069,536879198,536880573,536881007,536881084,536881117,536881123,536882121,536882478,536882701,536882765,536884918,536885038,536885573,536898541,536900683,536901279,536901402,536902082],"videos":[{"id":15475,"video_id":"9-ot7wUVgyo"},{"id":57662,"video_id":"dScq4P5gn4A"}]},{"id":31914,"name":"Island Simulator 2016","platforms":[{"id":6,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}],"screenshots":[{"id":50763,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/zzdzx8oeb0rvb6iqkv1t.jpg"},{"id":50764,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/fsybegnabgzmvbhnlijh.jpg"},{"id":50765,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/tmubn1ypgsozc4pwhdqf.jpg"},{"id":50766,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/iaqurof9upgwb873qwz2.jpg"},{"id":50767,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/w5mawfmn1bje8igm4xtp.jpg"}],"summary":"Don't be fooled by the name, Island Simulator 2016 is so much more than your average simulator!

A Sega Game Gear game, of the same name and genre, Ristar, was also released, which shared similar themes while possessing different level design and gameplay mechanics. The game stars an anthropomorphic cartoon star who uses his hands and long, stretchable arms to both move and combat enemies. Reception for the game has been generally positive, but the game's initial release was overshadowed due to the imminent ending of the Genesis's lifecycle and the succession of the Sega Saturn and other fifth generation video game consoles. While never receiving any sequels, Sega has re-released the game a number of times digitally and on Sega-themed compilations, and has occasionally given Ristar himself cameos in other Sega properties.","tags":[1,18,268435464,268435487,536871208,536871213,536871315,536871506,536871510,536871611,536871882,536871939,536871971,536872010,536872039,536872070,536872140,536872617,536872622,536872651,536872898,536872961,536873192,536873236,536873273,536874115,536874139,536874209,536874315,536874398,536874706,536874743,536874745,536875046,536875047,536875073,536875075,536875076,536875077,536875081,536875083,536875200,536875208,536875209,536875232,536875262,536875286,536875303,536875305,536875315,536875362,536875434,536875461,536875489,536875495,536875534,536875550,536875606,536875665,536875670,536875672,536875699,536875702,536875743,536875815,536875852,536875870,536875871,536875903,536875917,536875942,536875944,536876015,536876017,536876069,536876120,536876126,536876188,536876340,536876353,536876375,536876377,536876449,536876526,536876540,536876546,536876659,536876726,536877110,536877230,536877679,536878192,536878199,536878218,536878394,536878395,536878439,536878597,536879717,536880463,536882346,536882649]},{"id":145931,"cover":{"id":137597,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co2y65.jpg"},"name":"Pokémon Adventures: Red Chapter","platforms":[{"id":6,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"},{"id":24,"name":"Game Boy Advance"}],"screenshots":[{"id":432872,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc9a08.jpg"},{"id":432873,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc9a09.jpg"},{"id":432874,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc9a0a.jpg"},{"id":432875,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc9a0b.jpg"}],"summary":"This hack is an adaptation of the Pokémon Adventures/Special Manga, in the eyes of Red.

Farmquest can be played by children of any age. Thanks to the voice output, even toddlers are able to explore the hidden object pictures on their own. They do not need to be able to read to have a sense of achievement. Concentration and attentiveness are taught in a playful way.

A HYBRID OF ALTERNATIVE HORROR AND CREEPYPASTA... \nWelcome to the Halloween Edition v1.03! \nTake a deep breath, dim the lights, put on your headphones... \n \nNon-linear first-person gameplay lets you explore Grimhaven Orphanage and discover the characters who once lived there – voiced by Dan Bull, Chuck Huber and Raychul Moore, plus a multitude of other great voices from around the world - some of which we discovered through our global YouTube auditions! \n \nWe call this ‘alt horror’ because it has no graphic violence, blood or guns. As the player, you have no defense... however, you must show empathy and courage to save the twelve missing orphans. This is a game for people who like to explore, listen, think and solve - and play cat and mouse in a dark and scary maze. Listen to the nineteen personal creepypasta-style stories to piece together the mysterious events of that fateful night in 1898, when twelve orphans simply... disappeared! Now with shorter (30-60 sec) in-game stories to enhance the tension and new plot twists when you least expect them! And don’t panic story lovers! The full stories are still there – on the menu page and somewhere within the game… if you know where to look!! \n \nFind the twelve orphan’s mementos and place them on the correct headstones to set the lost souls free. Did we mention the headstones are in a hedge maze? Custom-created by a ‘Ripley’s Believe-It-Or-Not’ Maze Master? No problem! But first you’ll have to find the key... Are you up to the challenge? Did we mention the Huntsman… in the maze… stalking you? Did we mention he may also be lurking in Grimhaven Orphanage? \n \nSo – how fast can you turn and run? Well you won’t know ‘till you check it out! So go do it! Have fun!! Scare yourself as much as you want (maybe you should keep the hallway light on…!) \n \nThis is a Free Upgrade for all our Steam key holders and supporters of our Black Friday Edition – THANK YOU!","tags":[1,268435487,268435488]},{"id":126587,"cover":{"id":107398,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co2ava.jpg"},"name":"Project Starship X","platforms":[{"id":6,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"},{"id":48,"name":"PlayStation 4"},{"id":49,"name":"Xbox One"},{"id":130,"name":"Nintendo Switch"}],"screenshots":[{"id":368466,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc7wb6.jpg"},{"id":368467,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc7wb7.jpg"},{"id":368468,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc7wb8.jpg"},{"id":368469,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc7wb9.jpg"},{"id":368470,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc7wba.jpg"},{"id":368471,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc7wbb.jpg"},{"id":368472,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc7wbc.jpg"},{"id":368473,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc7wbd.jpg"}],"summary":"Project Starship X is a procedural shooter where you Crash-Kill cosmical abominations with your spaceship while playing as Swagthulhu!

The success of the Dreamcast version led to it becoming one of the few Sega All Stars titles.\n\nLike Nintendo's Punch-Out!! series it features many characters with colorful personalities (i.e. Afro Thunder, Boris \"The Bear\" Knokimov, etc.); however, unlike the Punch-Out!! series, Ready 2 Rumble Boxing is in 3D, thus allowing for more control over your character in the ring, and also enables the players to choose whichever fighters they want.\n\nThroughout the fights in the game, there is a special RUMBLE meter which fills up, one letter at a time, until the word \"RUMBLE\" is spelled at the bottom of the screen. Letters can be obtained by successfully landing hard blows or taunting the opponent. Once the meter is full, the player can power himself up, enabling access to a special move called \"Rumble Flurry\", which might as well instantly knock the opposite player out cold.\n\nOne unique graphic feature of the game is the gradual bruises gained by players as the fight progresses (like hematomas and swellings), present in all fifth-generation versions. While this is not necessarily a new feature to games (it had been implemented before in SNK's 1992 game Art of Fighting), it garnered much appraisal from reviewers, because of the added fun factor this element supply to the game","tags":[27,268435460,268435470,536871213,536871262,536871544,536871784,536871889,536875184,536875225,536875359,536875360,536875406,536875435,536875590,536875803,536876210,536876266,536876835,536876856,536877409,536877631,536877702,536877804,536880415,536880441,536881476,536883882,536884031]},{"id":18220,"aggregated_rating":81.1428571428571,"cover":{"id":100716,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co25po.jpg"},"name":"Rhythm Heaven Megamix","platforms":[{"id":37,"name":"Nintendo 3DS"}],"screenshots":[{"id":171094,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/ltvio3ygtix1js6m1him.jpg"},{"id":171095,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/d0oo6shldmwike7f9nqb.jpg"},{"id":171096,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/zfxv05ms9bvnbjces9z4.jpg"},{"id":171097,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/m75bc5zvkueynyfhmegn.jpg"},{"id":171098,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/jkchrkzzyprmyahz8wlu.jpg"},{"id":171099,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/pyx0qhojqefn4fyvhgkg.jpg"},{"id":171100,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/evac79xcq9mhu6sugrri.jpg"},{"id":171101,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/akqxgqkuuwvxrmb5c8sd.jpg"},{"id":171102,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/tqvousch0b3unncvtg8e.jpg"},{"id":171103,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/gxeeyffqpob2elzhtztk.jpg"},{"id":171104,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/itdr23l9t3me9oztnpss.jpg"}],"summary":"Test your rhythm by chopping wood, sticking speeding viruses with forks and playing badminton while flying an airplane, all in time to catchy tunes in this deceptively challenging rhythm game.

A dark, mysterious power has manifested itself in the depths of the gas giant, absorbing life and technology, and assimilating all in its wake. Spacecraft, pilots, androids, and computers: Nothing is safe. No one can escape the virus that infects all life forms, turning once brave heroes and peaceful colonists alike into ravaging, chaotic forces, fighting each other and infecting more in the process. Soulless technology and hate-driven humanoids are all that's left of Earth's once-proud fleet. The galaxy as we know it is threatening to fall apart.

Those who aren't yet infected--the resistance, a band of mercenaries, soldiers and civilians--are Earth's final hope, and they have one goal in common: To stop the deadly infection and destroy the core of all evil, hidden in the depths of Conceyta. Scouts have undertaken a merciless mission to bring detailed plans and data on the location of the power and its defence line in a last attempt to save humankind. So it has come to be that the last remaining pilot, a mercenary and bounty hunter, is the only chance of survival, ironically driven by the desire for wealth and fame. Left with little choice, the resistance has developed a star fighter capable of intercepting the evil force, equipped with a deadly weapon system and of utmost agility. With no time to lose, the 10th and final prototype of the ship is handed to the pilot. Its name: \"Sldner-X\". Should the pilot succeed, his name shall live on in the memories of man forever to come.

The series is a younger brother to the Madden NFL series.\n\nIn July 2013, the NCAA announced that it would not renew its licensing contract with Electronic Arts because of an ongoing legal dispute regarding the use of player likenesses in the games. However, this contract only covers the use of the NCAA name and related logos, not those of individual schools and conferences, which are negotiated individually or through the Collegiate Licensing Company. The CLC concurrently announced that it would extend its existing licensing deal with EA through 2017, ensuring that EA Sports could continue the series without the NCAA branding.[1] However, the series was placed on hiatus in September 2013, following three major conferences pulling their trademark licenses from EA, and uncertainties surrounding the results of lawsuits involving the use of player likenesses in-game. However, EA Sports is still making an attempt to get the series back going.[2]","tags":[268435469,268435470,536870938,536870939,536872060,536872078,536872352,536875138,536875186,536875562,536877686,536878091,536878092,536878094,536878095,536878111,536878125,536884030]},{"id":18017,"aggregated_rating":85.75,"cover":{"id":169426,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co3mqa.jpg"},"name":"The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess HD","platforms":[{"id":41,"name":"Wii U"}],"screenshots":[{"id":176381,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/zcv4p0kcalojk0osek3k.jpg"},{"id":176382,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/wddvzhkvkk6ugwkdu25v.jpg"},{"id":176383,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sjqspf6qqnxumzfepgqk.jpg"},{"id":176384,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/bulhcrz2ynpngwe1cvad.jpg"},{"id":176385,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/v0b4ditsaueur7h5df7i.jpg"},{"id":176386,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/hig2sdtbq0uzysbtdjk5.jpg"},{"id":176387,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/jt9rtpnbbvh16chhprxr.jpg"},{"id":176388,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/pckzu00gmkuwltqtxdm5.jpg"},{"id":176389,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/epvoyigtm8ct1bvupuat.jpg"},{"id":176390,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/rjjyu60omsdtiyhee9oo.jpg"}],"summary":"The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess is a critically acclaimed masterpiece, set in a massive world bursting with life - but also shadow.

Playable from start to finish as of 2020, the hack boasts 43 total chapters, 62 playable characters, and various unique mechanics that help to set it apart from the game it deviates from.\n\nOn the continent of Yaska lies six distinct nations, including the empire of Nevan, led by Emperor Festan. The imperial state of Belaro, led by Lord Gradin, has resorted to heavily taxing its citizens, jailing those who cannot comply. Needless to say, this proves unpopular with the state's population, including Storch, a young farmer, and his friends and family. Soon, he's resorting to stealing from the rich to be able to help his family avoid prison. One excursion into a relatively wealthy part of Belaro ultimately leads him down a path that would change the course of Nevan's history.\n\nDesigned to be played as an ironman run, hence the large cast, Vision Quest boasts an incredible amount of content and a tone that slides carefully between drama and humor with its character interactions and small scale compared to most Fire Emblem games (more in line with Fire Emblem: Thracia 776 than anything else). The game is divided into four parts, similar to Fire Emblem: Radiant Dawn, with each progressively growing in scale without ever resorting to having you fight dragons or gods.
