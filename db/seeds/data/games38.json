Sixty stages await you, filled with a wide variety of puzzles ranging from easy to mind-bendingly difficult! \n \nPlaces you go are mapped automatically, and once you cover all the tiles on a floor you will complete the picture hidden underneath. \n \nAs in the previous game, battles feature a large number of dynamic and powerful enemies. The hero is unable to attack due to the Witch\u0027s Curse, so he must protect his partner with a shield and guide her to attack by chopping down or slashing sideways. Also, you can trigger a power move by raising the shield at the same time as an enemy attack. \n \nExplore the depths of the dungeon to uncover the mystery of the Witch\u0027s Curse!",

Some features, such as creating masks in edit mode and the MMA style grappling system, would not be carried over to WWF No Mercy.\n\nVirtual Pro Wrestling 2 carries the All Japan Pro Wrestling license, and features 21 wrestlers from their promotion. The rest of the characters included in the game are based on other real promotions and wrestlers, but due to copyright have fake names and appearances. This is common among other Japanese wrestling games. You can identify who the other wrestler\u0027s are by their unique moves and taunts, and the edit mode contains each piece of ring attire you would need to recreate their actual likeness.\n\nIn total, there are 98 wrestlers in the game, 23 of which have to be unlocked. There is also 16 original character slots you can use to edit and create your own wrestlers, bringing the potential total of wrestlers in the game to 114. This game has the largest roster of all of AKI\u0027s wrestling games. In comparison, WWF No Mercy would have 64 wrestlers available.",

Now you\u0027re saying \"what\u0027s the catch?\", am I right, or am I right? Well, that\u0027s the best part, my friend: no catch, no consequences, no questions asked.\n\nI\u0027m Captain Yesterday, inventor, entrepreneur, and all-around family man... presenting to you, the Yesterizer (patent pending), your one-stop-shop for all things today, tomorrow and yesterday. I\u0027m offering you a one-time only, once-in-a-lifetime, not-even-for-my-mother 100% discount on a journey through time. You see, ever since I started rolling these things out we\u0027d have a few... complications, shall we say. We\u0027re talking sick people flying out of holes in the ground. Far from ideal, I\u0027m sure you\u0027d agree. If you take care of them, and I keep selling time machines, bingo-bango we\u0027re back in business.\n\nAnd hey, if all goes to plan I\u0027ll even sell you your own Yesterizer. Pretty neat, huh?",

The source of the game\u0027s mechanics come from Qbby\u0027s ability to spawn boxes out of his body, the number of which varies between each level. These boxes can spread out in whatever direction is possible to make various shapes and can either be carried or thrown and pushed around. The boxes have various uses, such as allowing players to reach high ledges or cross large gaps, holding down switches, or blocking deadly lasers. Additionally, by hooking these boxes onto a ledge while Qbby is still attached, he can pull himself up. \n \nEach level features one or more crowns, which can be collected with advanced play but will become uncollectable if the player uses too many boxes during a level. These crowns unlock additional worlds as the game progresses. Medals obtained from clearing each level can be spent on extras, such as costumes, technique manuals, and bonus levels.",

In the future, Earth has become home to many different alien races. While most of them are peaceful, some are not. In order to protect earth, six teens were called to form the Space Patrol Delta team. Players will control a certain ranger for each of the nine levels. While the rangers\u0027 fighting abilities are similar, each has his or her own unique power. The Red Ranger can move through objects, the Yellow Ranger can create duplicates of herself, the Green Ranger can see heat trails, the Blue Ranger can create a force field, and the Pink Ranger can replicate objects she touches. There\u0027s also a Shadow Ranger who has special abilities players will uncover as they progress through the game. Each level in this platformer has players running, jumping, and attacking enemies as they guide the chosen ranger through the many obstacles that Gruumm has created. Each of the nine levels is controlled by a boss that the Rangers must defeat to move on. After certain levels, the Rangers will summon the Megazord to do battle with giant monsters. Fans of the POWER RANGERS won\u0027t want to miss this instalment in the series. POWER RANGERS: SPACE PATROL DELTA is an out-of-this-world fighting experience.",

Armchair generals and fans of grand strategy can take their turns building great empires or protecting the world from tyranny during these pivotal moments in world history.\n\nIn addition to nation-level trade and diplomatic concerns, you are tasked with managing region and city-level projects, choosing the right technologies to research, directing military movement and development, conducting international diplomacy, maintaining domestic stability and producing resources vital to making everything else possible. Developing production and research facilities in cities transforms them into centers of industry and technology. Upgraded cities can produce new units and unlock advanced technologies. At the region level, you can build large-scale defensive structures such as radar arrays and fortifications, develop transportation infrastructure, and expand the resource production needed to fuel your economy. Victory on the world stage will require that all levels of your empire work together towards your goals.\n\nEvery turn offers countless decisions and options to move forward, writing the history of your empire. Will you block trade routes with your navy, choking off enemy supplies? Will you grant a restless ethnic or religious group independence to prevent widespread revolt? Will you build up your trade agreements and expand your influence with industrial might, or invest in an expensive, technologically advanced army to crush all opposition? In addition to keeping domestic and economic plans on track, you will be challenged by outside powers - Controlled by human players in a multiplayer match or period-inspired AI - that will pursue their own national agendas and interfere in the affairs of you and your allies.

Phantasy Star Online Episode I \u0026 II Plus was created in mind to fix this problem. Along with this problem, SEGA included extra content for offline with this game including: \n- Episode II Challenge Mode, which was perviously only online. \n- Perviously Online only quests, Seat of the Heart, West Tower and East Tower are now available offline. \n- Central Dome Fire Swirl, a downloadable quest for the Xbox, is now available offline. \n- The downloadable goods from Fake in Yellow quest are now available offline. \n \nAside from some extra cheat protection, Phantasy Star Online Episode I \u0026 II Plus ran exactly the same as the original version and all data from characters, items, ect, can be swapped between the two instantly.",

Also the international version is slightly different from the Japanese version (different in-game character designs and behavior of the enemy characters). \n \nVarious monsters that Godzilla had previously defeated, have kidnapped his son, Minilla, and hidden him somewhere inside the Labyrinth of Matrix. It is up to Godzilla to fight the monsters\u0027 attacks and solve their many puzzles, all while navigating a much larger maze. \n \nMonsters- \nGodzilla: The first playable character. He must punch boulders through 64 levels, in order to find his son. \nMinilla: Godzilla\u0027s son, who was captured and placed in the heart of the Labyrinth of Matrix. He is only seen in the end, and does not appear in any of the levels. \nBaragon: A slow moving enemy. \nMechagodzilla: One of Godzilla\u0027s main rivals, with a speed that is slightly slower than Godzilla\u0027s. \nHedorah: A normally invincible monster, that can only be defeated by a boulder, a spike pit, or a lightning bolt. He is also the slowest in movement. \nAnguirus: A mutant ankylosaurus that is usually an ally of Godzilla. Normally is a regular paced enemy, but once he is leveled with Godzilla, he will charge at a high speed, making him the fastest in the game. \nRodan: A mutant pterosaur that, just like Anguirus, is usually Godzilla\u0027s ally, but now an enemy who flies after him, making it harder to avoid damage. \nGhidorah: A mutant space dragon. After about two minutes, Ghidorah will appear. Having both invincibility and flight, it is very hard to make it past him. He can\u0027t be killed by anything. Ghidorah also flies in short bursts.",

The cars range from 4X4s, trucks, and off-road racers to slick street cars, Lamborghinis and the like. While initially it may seem like there is a deficit of courses, in fact, the multi-terrain courses contain mini-courses within each one. For instance, at least three times in each course, you will have the choice to take two different road directions -- either rough dirt track or snow-laden road, ot a slick but usually longer street course. Each car handles terrains differently, and some, like the trucks, obviously handle the off-roads better than others, but you can also modify your street car to handle dirst roads well, too.",

The parchments give one vague clue to each mystery, but many others are concealed within the church. Why does the great organ have one lever more than it has records? Why did Victor Paz have a well drilled in the catacombs? Could the rumor of a hidden spiral staircase in one of the big columns be true? With an eye for details and an alert mind, you will uncover secrets almost everywhere in the awe-inspiring building.\n\nFortunately, you are not alone: the cheerful Dani accompanies you on your quest. As you travel back in time with every step into the cathedrals past, Dani is first replaced by the butler Jasper, then by the medieval monk Daniel. Your companions are vital for your progress; not only do they provide clues and carry surplus equipment, but you may also give them specific orders to help you solve puzzles: on your command, they will go to any location, operate machinery or help you move things that are too heavy for one person alone.",

Only the equatorial regions are still habitable, yet pockets of humanity survive in small numbers all over the planet, hanging onto existence in the resource-rich territories to the north and south--resources that everyone wants to control... Protect the colony in the wastelands of old Russia from raiders, marauders, and strange creatures. Be the savior. Give humanity a second chance.",

Warau Warawau became a cult hit and is still popular among Japanese fans.\n\nThis is the first game to not use a mix of public domain music (classic, jazz, ragtime etc.), but instead it features the free music by Hirokazu Akiyama, whose music was also used in other RPG Maker games/series like Alicemare.",
