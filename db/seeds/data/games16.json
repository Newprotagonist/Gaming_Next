The game marked Team17\u0027s return to its 2D roots.[2] The game spawned a sequel, Worms: Open Warfare 2, which is also available on Nintendo DS and PlayStation Portable. \n \nIn Worms: Open Warfare, the player takes control of an army of worms. The goal of the game is to defeat the opposing army through reducing the health points of enemy worms using various types of weaponry while avoiding friendly fire and other obstacles. The weapons and gadgets you use in battle include grenades, homing missiles, bazookas, cluster bombs, banana bombs (a Worms staple), dynamite, air strikes, shotguns, and many more. You can also choose from a variety of settings to battle in and make your own schemes and teams. \nThe game is played in rounds with each worm starting with 100 hit points. Each team takes turns controlling one of their worms. The player is usually allocated 60 seconds per turn to move their worm around the battlefield and attack the opponent worms, though this time limit is customisable when playing non-career games. Only one attack is allowed per turn. \nIn addition to timing individual player turns, each round has a 20-minute time limit. If the round timer runs down to 0:00 before a team claims victory, every worm\u0027s HP drops to 1, creating a sudden death scenario. During the course of a round, crates containing health or weapons will occasionally drop and the water level will rise.",

The local co-op mode, called Co-Driver, allows one player to drive using the Wii Remote™ controller or Wii U Pro Controller while another player uses the Wii U GamePad to provide control and navigation assistance on an interactive real-time map. Using just their fingertips, the partner can distract pursuing cops, switch from night to day or activate enhanced performance for any car and even control the amount of traffic on the road.For another competitive edge, players can switch into their favorite cars, track milestones, uncover the city’s hidden gems and more, all on the fly with the Wii U touch screen, ensuring nothing ever slows them down.  \n  \nNeed for Speed Most Wanted U brings the blockbuster action of the open world racer to players’ fingertips. The entire game is playable off-screen using the Wii U GamePad, so gamers never have to put the game down.  \n  \nNeed for Speed Most Wanted U includes the Ultimate Speed Pack expansion, so players can take to the streets with five of the most absurdly fast cars ever made: McLaren’s F1 LM, Lamborghini’s minimalist artwork, the Aventador J, the track-focused Pagani Zonda R, Bugatti’s reigning world speed champion, the Bugatti Veyron Grand Sport Vitesse and Hennessey’s savage 275 mile-an-hour ragtop beast, the Venom GT Spyder.  \n  \nFinally with Need for Speed Most Wanted U, gamers are competing against the people they want to defeat most – their friends. With EA’s innovative online technology Autolog 2, the game automatically tracks and compares best race times, high scores and more. These stats are broadcast throughout the open world, fueling friendly competition and rivalries.Need for Speed Most Wanted’s online multiplayer also ups the ante for social competition. Gamers pick a car, meet up with their friends and are immersed in a non-stop playlist of action-packed events. Whether it’s competing for the best starting position, the ultimate jump, or finishing first place, if there’s something to do, there’s someone to beat. Any Speed Points earned on Wii U will add to your existing total if you are playing the game on any of the other available platforms through CloudCompete.\"",

Its grand opening was supposed to have been two year ago. That event never happened. A chain of mysterious events has now left the Utopia abandoned and silent.\n\nPeople have gone missing. Electromagnetic disturbances are increasing. Armed with only a camera and a torch, you must journey there alone to explore its winding corridors, its secret passageways, and its gloomy halls. Local townspeople say Wittard kept a terrible secret. They speak fearfully of someone or something malevolent living at his city. They say it is waiting and growing in power.

    "summary": "Falcon Bartender is a promotional remake of Tapper. The goal in Falcon Beertender is the same as in Tapper, and the layout is very similar: as a barkeeper, your job is to serve your customers a mug of beer each. If you don\u0027t do this in time before they reach the counter, they will hit you, costing you a life.\n\nFalcon Beertender enhances the gameplay of Tapper in 2 ways. First, your customers can sometimes be very thirsty: they will toss back an empty beer mug for you to fill. You\u0027ll have to catch those mugs and pass them more beer. Secondly, breaking a (glass) mug also costs you a life, so you must make sure that you\u0027re not tossing more beer mugs than necessary, lest they crash into a back wall.",

In the race, be sure to choose the best tyre and pit stop strategy, to win some places in the grid. \n \nThe game has several playable seasons: the 1976 F1 season, with Lauda and Hunt competing; the 1991 F1 Season, with Ayrton, Piquet, Mansell and Prost in the grid; and the 2000 F1 Season, with Michael Schumacher being the one to beat. \n \nThe game has an in-built Hall of Fame, to which the drivers may be inducted into, if they win titles and races enough. \n \nThere are also 10 Achievements to be unlocked, throughout the seasons. Some of them are really hard to unlock (like winning the Drivers Championship with Rubens Barrichello), which makes this game really challenging.",

    "summary": "Super 3D Noah\u0027s Ark is an unlicensed Christian-themed video game for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System and DOS. It was released by the biblical video game producer Wisdom Tree in 1994, and was the only commercially released SNES game in the U.S. that was not officially sanctioned by Nintendo. In order to bypass the Super Nintendo\u0027s lockout chip, Wisdom Tree devised a pass-through system similar to the Game Genie, where the player had to insert an officially licensed SNES game into the cartridge slot on top of the Super 3D Noah\u0027s Ark cartridge. Despite its name, it is unrelated to Konami\u0027s official Noah\u0027s Ark game for the Nintendo Entertainment System. In January 2014, the game was re-released for the SNES, initially available only by private email orders, but later through Piko Interactive\u0027s website. The game was also updated for the 20th Anniversary Edition and released at itch.io on May 26, 2014 for Windows, Mac OS X, and Linux.\nThe game plays similarly to Wolfenstein 3D, but the graphics were changed to reflect a non-violent theme. Instead of killing Nazi soldiers in a castle, the player takes the part of Noah, wandering the Ark, using a slingshot to shoot sleep-inducing food at angry attacking animals, mostly goats, in order to render them unconscious. The animals behave differently: goats, the most common enemy, will only kick Noah, while the other animals such as sheep, ostriches, antelopes and oxen will shoot spittle at him from a distance. Goats are also unable to open doors, which the other animals can do.\nThe gameplay is aimed at younger children. Noah\u0027s Ark includes secret passages, food, weapons and extra lives. There are secret levels, and shortcut levels as well. The player eventually comes across larger and more powerful slingshots, and flings coconuts and watermelon at the larger boss-like animals, such as Ernie the Elephant and Carl the Camel.",

When Timmy discovers Chin has been kidnapped, the only person to save the day is Chin\u0027s sidekick, Cleft the Boy Chin Wonder, who just happens to be Timmy in costume. The player must release Chin from captivity by defeating enemies and overcoming obstacles along the way in this side-scrolling, action-packed videogame. Timmy\u0027s quirky Fairy Godparents, Cosmo and Wanda, appear throughout the 20 game stages to offer their own strange attempts at assistance. Cosmo and Wanda will supply Timmy/Cleft items to use in his journey -- some of which are key in defeating the captors. Throughout Fairly OddParents, gamers will move through several environments, including the Comic World, the Primitive Age, the Present World and the Future World.",

    "summary": "The five missions in the game are each three or four stages long. Several hostages are being held in each stage; Joe must rescue all of them before he is allowed to finish the stage. The last stage in each mission has no hostages, but instead features a powerful boss character whom Joe must defeat. After completing each of the first four missions the player is taken to a bonus stage, where he can earn an extra life if he is able to kill all of the ninjas leaping towards him. Completing the fifth mission ends the game. Also, once the fifth mission begins, continues are no longer allowed; the player has to finish the game with however many lives he has left at that point. If the player earns a place on the high score board, the number of credits it took him to get that score is displayed along with his score.\n\nJoe\u0027s standard weapons are an unlimited supply of shuriken, along with punches and kicks when attacking at close range. One hostage per stage gives him a power-up. When powered-up, his throwing stars are replaced by a gun that fires large, explosive bullets, and his close-range attack becomes a katana slash. Joe can also perform \"ninja magic,\" which may be used only once per stage and kills (or damages, in the case of bosses) all enemies on the screen. The game also allows the enemies to hide behind boxes or use shields to block Musashi\u0027s shurikens.[4]\n\nJoe can be killed with one hit, provided he is hit by a projectile or melee attack, but if he does not find himself in those situations, the player can touch regular enemies and just be pushed back without being damaged. Since most enemies appear in the same place on each level, it is possible to master the game by memorizing their locations and devising patterns to defeat them.\n\nAt the end of each stage, the player receives score bonuses based on performance. Completing the stage without using ninja magic or without using any throwing stars or bullets earns the player a point bonus. The player has three minutes to complete each stage; remaining time at the end of the stage is also converted to bonus points and added to the player\u0027s score.",

Basing on this knowledge, you can choose a therapy for him (observation, medication or referring to another specialist) or administer a X-Ray or ultrasound scan to get more information about his illness.\n\nIn some cases, surgery will be necessary. You\u0027re the surgeon and you have to perform the operation very carefully, adhering strictly to the procedures, preserving hygiene, and maintaining care when cutting up the patient.\n\nShould you mistakenly administer the wrong therapy, or kill your patient at the operating table, you\u0027re kicked into the medical school, where you\u0027re given hints as to what you\u0027ve done wrong.",

The player goes from town to town and dungeon to dungeon, following the central story and occasionally branching off to perform side quests. Characters gain Experience Points from battle and level up as a result, becoming gradually stronger as time passes and more battles are fought.\n\nBattles are much more action-oriented: they take place in real time, during which the player has manual control over their character, as opposed to choosing options from a menu. Battles take place on a broad battlefield, over which the player\u0027s character can move without limit, allowing them to trade blows face-to-face with the enemy or circle around for a flanking attack. The other party members (up to 3 others) are controlled by the game\u0027s AI; the player may change an ally\u0027s Strategy to one of six different pre-determined options (ranging from \"Spread out and attack\" to \"Save your Magic Points\" to \"Stand Still and Don\u0027t Do Anything\").",

However, with the release of the Nintendo 64 looming close, Nintendo decided to cancel the game despite it being nearly complete. Many features of this game were later reused in Star Fox 64, most notably Star Wolf, and the game itself was later leaked as source code and compiled into a working ROM.\nThe game was later released for the SNES Classic console as an unlockable game, marking its first official release. Since then, the game was also released for the Nintendo Switch Online service.",
