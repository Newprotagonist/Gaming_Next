This game is not based on the movie Starship Troopers. Both, the game and the movie, are based upon the novel by Robert A. Heinlein.\n\nThis is one of the few strategy games where you cannot build a base and recruit units. Instead you lead up to three squads into combat. Each squad contains a leader, five soldiers and one specialist (medic, engineer, PSI for detecting hidden bugs, MIST-Trooper as a sniper). During a mission there is no reinforcement and you are outnumbered by the bugs. The enemy units are not very intelligent, but they use their own special abilities like splitting acid and are very powerful. There is a wide range of enemies, from simple close-range fighters to suicide units, artillery bugs and even human soldiers. The mission objectives are also different. From simple hunting missions up to escorts or the capturing of bugs.\n\nThe game also have a RPG part. Surviving soldiers gain experience points for each killed bug / destroyed bug holes. By and by the soldiers increase their states and acquire higher ranks. Better battle suits (armor) and stronger weapons are only available for soldiers with high ranks. The basic soldier (called Cat Trooper) have no armor and is an easy prey for the bugs. Besides the experience points you gather upgrade points for your equipment for e.g. increase the damage of the weapons. Another aspect of the RPG part is that you can equip each of your soldiers individual with up to two different weapons and two tech-items (like bombs or toxic gas).\n\nThe graphic of the landscape is low on details, everything looks post apocalyptic. Much better is the combat graphic and the explosions. The cutscenes are made with the in-game graphic.

Due to limitations of the PC hardware, the game engine was quite poor in comparison to the Famicom/NES original. Most notable was the lack of scrolling; the PC version would instead show each screen one at a time.\n\nThis port brings the levels, new enemies and power-ups back to the Famicom/NES engine. Also included are most of the unique background changes and other features not possible with the original SMB engine. The end result is a much more playable game that feels like a legitimate sequel.","tags":[1,268435464,268435487,536871946,536872916,536873834,536887608,536894878],"videos":[{"id":66476,"video_id":"WtcMCccN0zQ"}]},{"id":136979,"cover":{"id":161110,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co3gba.jpg"},"name":"Challenger","platforms":[{"id":5,"name":"Wii"},{"id":41,"name":"Wii U"},{"id":55,"name":"Legacy Mobile Device"},{"id":99,"name":"Family Computer"}],"screenshots":[{"id":396649,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc8i21.jpg"},{"id":396650,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc8i22.jpg"},{"id":396651,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc8i23.jpg"},{"id":549999,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scbsdr.jpg"}],"summary":"Play as Challenger, a brave archeologist whose mission is to rescue a princess who's been kidnapped by a secret evil organization.

The goal is to keep the ball within the playing field. Allowing it to exit will result in a gameover. In all, there are five stages, each one containing different concepts though having the basic overall objective. For example, in the Wild Go Round you'll control a ball on a moving record. Because the record is moving, it'll alter the direction of the ball at pivotal moments, which will require the player to be quick on his feet and act appropriately. In all, the game's modes include Pool Flower, Box Juggling, Power Slide, Human League, and Wild Go Round. For players who wish to play multiplayer they can link with another Game Boy Advance with just a single cartridge.

In 1998, the game was released with Image Fight as a one-disc doublebill on PlayStation and Sega Saturn. \nThe game centers around an unusual alien invasion against a colony planet in the year 2249—the aliens themselves are microscopic creatures that invade, infect, and kill the colonists. Scientists have deployed the microscopic fighter X-002 into the body of the hapless woman whose body has been invaded by the alien queen. \n \nImage Fight (イメージファイト) is a 1988 vertically scrolling shoot 'em up arcade game developed and published by Irem. The arcade game was also ported for the Nintendo Entertainment System, PC Engine (Japan-only), Sharp X68000 (Japan-only), and FM Towns (Japan-only) in 1990. \n \nThe player flies a futuristic red ship. R-Type Final identifies this ship as the OF-1 Daedalus, but it is not known if that was the ship's original name. However, the term OF-1 does appear in the NES version's instruction manual, as well as in the official artwork for the sequel, Image Fight II. The game appears to be set inside a holographic simulator, like the holodeck on Star Trek: The Next Generation. In the NES version of the game, the first 5 missions are called \"Combat Simulation Stages\" and the last 3 missions are called \"Real Combat Stages\". \n \nTwo separate titles on one very collectable compilation for the shooter fan. X Multiply is similar to Gradius with claustrophobic confines and organic add ons to the ship giving it floaty, stamen like guards. Image Fight is more a chunky R Type tribute with nice multi directional shots and an old school feel. The rarest of the Arcade Gears series.","tags":[1,268435461,536875870]},{"id":161849,"cover":{"id":164522,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co3iy2.jpg"},"name":"Microsoft Flight Simulator X: Steam Edition - Ultimate VFR Guam","platforms":[{"id":6,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}],"screenshots":[{"id":568348,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scc6jg.jpg"},{"id":568355,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scc6jn.jpg"},{"id":568361,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scc6jt.jpg"},{"id":568369,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scc6k1.jpg"},{"id":568377,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scc6k9.jpg"},{"id":568388,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scc6kk.jpg"},{"id":568395,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scc6kr.jpg"},{"id":568399,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scc6kv.jpg"}],"summary":"Ultimate VFR Guam is designed to be the ultimate in high detail photo scenery for Microsoft Flight Simulator X: Steam Edition.

Once the boss is defeated, Tarosuke goes to the next stage.","tags":[268435464,536872225,536872939]},{"id":7963,"aggregated_rating":50.0,"cover":{"id":8393,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/g4zchljwswnxnrsvs7py.jpg"},"name":"Mevo and the Grooveriders","platforms":[{"id":6,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}],"screenshots":[{"id":45294,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/vzyhgmrzufevg5hhbdne.jpg"},{"id":45295,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/u47n5tic3wpgsa3cuvbl.jpg"},{"id":45296,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/npvaoycnqgcqdjtccwih.jpg"},{"id":45297,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/guvckuzdkifvhfl7rctg.jpg"},{"id":45298,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/zf9zhirsoavullt6jjub.jpg"}],"summary":"In MEVO's quest to reunite his band, bring back 'FUNK', and defeat the enemy SILENCE, players must successfully progress through five beautifully crafted worlds (Ocean, Jungle, Desert, Space and Wormhole), finding avatars along the way that will help our reluctant hero unlock other levels and reach certain scores.

Electronic Arts told MTV Asia that \"EA Screen will provide visitors a chance to interact with EA's game producers hailing from the studios, and unveil the hugely anticipated SPORE Creature Creator demo version to gamers for the first time in Asia.\"[2] Electronic Arts VP Mark Buechner stated on the Spore Facebook page that the editor would be released in June or July 2008, saying, \"We are looking at releasing it two to three months before the launch of the full game.\"[3] \n \nThe SimCity Box artwork showed a blurb stating that the creature editor would be included with it.[4] IGN revealed that the Spore Creature Creator utility will be available in two different versions on June 18, 2008.[5] There was a paid version (for $9.95) and a free demo that was downloadable from Spore.com and included for free, bundled with The SimCity Box. The free version of the editor only contained 25% of the available creature parts that were found within the full version. In Australia, on August 30, 2008, three state newspapers owned by News Limited offered the full version either free or for $2.[6] \n \nThe utility includes a test environment for players to see their creatures go through animations and allowed the player to import other user-created creatures through the Sporepedia at Spore.com. The utility included screen capture and video tools as well,[5] including YouTube functionality.[7] The editor also gave the user the ability to create animated avatars,[8] and output in RSS and embeddable HTML code to facilitate easy incorporation into such sites as MySpace and Facebook.[9] The software is automatically superseded by Spore when it is installed, since the Creature editor is already present on the game. \n \nShortly after its introduction, the Creature Creator was used to create creatures with oversized genitalia, either stand-alone or engaged in coitus (a phenomenon quickly dubbed \"sporn\").[10] EA responded with e-mails sent to those who made pornographic machinima from its demo, and has flagged certain on-line accounts for \"TOS violations\".[11] Furthermore, YouTube has pulled several such videos for violations of its own TOS.[12] \n \nBy June 24, 2008, users had already uploaded over one million creatures to the site.[13] During Electronic Arts' E3 2008 presentation on July 14, 2008, Wright humorously noted that fans had done God's work at 38% efficiency by creating the same number of currently known species on Earth, 1,589,000, in about 18 days, compared to God's 6 days.[14] When Spore debuted on September 1, 2008, over 3 million creatures had been added to the Sporepedia via the Spore Creature Creator. \n \nWhen installing Spore, Spore Creature Creator must be uninstalled.","tags":[268435469,536872060,536872611,536872810,536875271,536875432,536875735,536876581,536877755,536878467,536879774,536880294,536883035,536883988,536884507]},{"id":54492,"name":"MokMok","platforms":[{"id":6,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"},{"id":14,"name":"Mac"}],"screenshots":[{"id":117999,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/tu9huozqlmcizdbvgd2x.jpg"},{"id":118000,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/ivbeoh2baqmzri5ooqmw.jpg"},{"id":118001,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/o9j1vqqzklnec317yakk.jpg"},{"id":118002,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/gdnd87squefwqel0ph9s.jpg"},{"id":118003,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/imhg7i5z5z3mzk8jwaq2.jpg"}],"summary":"MokMok is a musical adventure.

It was the only other game to run on Namco Phozon hardware, and in the US, a modification kit was later released to change the name to Galaga 3, possibly to increase recognition among fans of the games even though there was no \"Galaga 2\".\n\nSince Gaplus is a sequel to Galaga, it has similar gameplay. The player controls a spaceship, that can now move vertically (limited to halfway up the screen, much like Atari's Centipede) as well as horizontally, and shoots at swarms of incoming insect-like aliens which fly in formation above it and swoop down to attack it in akamikaze-like dive. In this sequel, the level starts over if the player gets killed before all the enemies have come in. When all enemies are killed, the player moves on to the next level. By obtaining certain powerups, it is possible to shoot sixty bullets per screen, the most any Galaxian-related game has.","tags":[1,268435461,536871078,536871859,536872352,536872651,536872983,536873064,536873186,536875046,536875075,536875076,536875121,536875434,536876391,536876953,536878084,536878192,536881254]},{"id":7076,"aggregated_rating":60.0,"cover":{"id":7248,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/tuqgarn87obaemy6rjvu.jpg"},"name":"Monster Madness: Battle for Suburbia","platforms":[{"id":6,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"},{"id":12,"name":"Xbox 360"}],"screenshots":[{"id":27328,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/e743jvdm0vh93y1ii8tq.jpg"}],"summary":"Monster Madness is an action adventure game following a group of teens as they fight to rid their town of an undead menace.","tags":[1,19,27,268435461,536871078,536871213,536871262,536871325,536872032,536872205,536873064,536875122,536875185,536875281,536875484,536875523,536875682,536875885,536875887,536875895,536876348,536876349,536876630,536876695,536877029,536877387,536877755,536878317,536883035,536884507]},{"id":199162,"cover":{"id":219538,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co4pea.jpg"},"name":"Alienzix","platforms":[{"id":48,"name":"PlayStation 4"}]},{"id":47667,"cover":{"id":46853,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/eltwix6av7qinxak5xvj.jpg"},"name":"Let's Golf 3D","platforms":[{"id":37,"name":"Nintendo 3DS"}],"screenshots":[{"id":163512,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/cspnpbtbaiqxcvpmgsda.jpg"},{"id":163513,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/a0ygh06dvxk093etxhqr.jpg"},{"id":163514,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/xwtzw8stcxyxf81dngrc.jpg"}],"summary":"Discover Let’s Golf 3D, one of the most fun and colorful golf game for the Nintendo 3DS™ system.

But one day, their land was attacked, and the talisman stolen. A brave warrior went out to investigate the talisman's disappearance, but returned mortally wounded. Before he died, he told his three sons that the talisman was stolen by the evil Necromancer, and must be retrieved at all costs... \n \nThe Faery Tale Adventure is a role-playing game in which the player can assume control of any of the three brothers - Julian, Philip, or Kevin. Each of the three has his own strengths: Julian is the archetypal melee fighter, Philip has high luck and intelligence, while Kevin is known for his kindness. Should the player fail while controlling one of the brothers, the next one will replace him. Each brother will be revived a few times when vanquished by an enemy, until his luck runs out, at which point he will die permanently. \n \nMuch of the gameplay is dedicated to exploring the large world, interacting with non-playable characters and building up the brothers' combat abilities by participating in battles. The fastest-growing parameter is bravery, which is comparable to experience points and strength combined. Each defeated enemy yields bravery points; as it grows, so does the hero's vitality (maximum hit points), albeit at a slower rate. Combat system is rather simple and is done in action style, with the player pressing a key or a mouse button while navigating the protagonist towards or away from the enemy. Predating Ultima V, the game has a day and night cycle, and the main character has to eat and rest. \n \nThe Faery Tale Adventure is notable for having a very vast world, usually considered the largest ever created for a video game at the time of its release. Players can explore approximately 17,000 screens of terrain. The world is also interconnected, i.e. there are no transitions between different types of areas. Items can be dropped by enemies as well as found anywhere in the game's world. There is also NPC interaction and quests the protagonist can undertake.","tags":[268435468,268435487,536871208,536871938,536871939]},{"id":105076,"name":"Shadow Blood VR","platforms":[{"id":6,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}],"screenshots":[{"id":216299,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/j65eajk9u7dnhfw8dizf.jpg"},{"id":216300,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/mrk5tloklorovyrospzk.jpg"},{"id":216301,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/u4ozrakl6lrrhutiruq0.jpg"},{"id":216302,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/gb1eldaqiatbyqu9nbbn.jpg"},{"id":216303,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/hntblj3fozf0wy0qvwsj.jpg"}],"summary":"Shadowblood VR is a first-person action game based on fantasy.

Like in Mortal Kombat, when a character wins both rounds, they can perform an execution move on the enemy. Methods included severing an opponent's limbs and torso (Al Rashid), beheading (The Executioner), repeated stabbing (Koyasha), impaling the opponent with a sword (Lord Deimos), breaking an opponent's back by hoisting them on top of a Viking helmet and throwing them to the ground, causing their body to explode (Ragnar), and some more far-fetched methods including pulling out an opponent's heart (Xiao Long), shrinking (Namira), transforming the opponent into a chicken (Taria), and entering an opponent's body and bursting them from inside (Dregan).\n\nNote: Heavily borrowing from the arcade game Soul Edge (1995)--first of the Souls Series.

This game was the first of its kind which allowed the player to interact in an entirely original 2.5D world, and can be credited as the game that started graphic adventure gaming on the PC. Though the original AGI parser-based version is outdated and primitive-looking by today's gaming standards, in 1984 it was revolutionary. King's Quest I was not only groundbreaking, but also history in the making. It was followed by seven sequels bearing the King's Quest title.\n\nIn 1990, Sierra released a remake of King's Quest I, taking advantage of newer technology and graphics (using their SCI engine, 16 color EGA graphics, sound card, and mouse support). Unfortunately, this version ended up being a total market failure. As a result, it was highly unlikely that Sierra ever had thoughts of making an even further updated Point-and-Click version of King's Quest I to match later games in the series. This is where we at AGDI decided to step in. Our aim was to remake King's Quest I: Quest for the Crown to the same level of quality as seen in Sierra's King's Quest V. We believe that the enhanced gaming experience for fans has justified our months of unpaid hard work.\n\nOur understanding is that the big companies stopped focusing on the adventure genre because, given the huge budget required to produce adventure games, it didn't prove as lucrative as other genres which were faster and cheaper to develop. Yet, we're hoping that by bringing back such classics adventure titles, we can prove that there is still huge fan interest in Point-and-Click adventure games and a successful market out there. This is our contribution to try to bring classic adventure games, as we used to know them, back to public attention, providing an alternative gaming experience for players who prefer to use their brains to solve puzzles over quick reflexes.\n\nDuring the first month of AGDI releasing our King's Quest I remake in August, 2001, over 5,000 copies were downloaded! In the first year, that number jumped to nearly half a million. The first add-on voice pack was downloaded hundreds of times in a period of just a few days, and thousands of times over the span of several months! It's obvious that there are still numerous adventure gaming fans, around the world, yearning to play more titles from this fantastic genre. AGDI's King's Quest I remake, and all of our future projects, are our gift to the fans of the adventure gaming community.","tags":[17,27,268435458,268435487]},{"id":5189,"cover":{"id":5181,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/lr7ulrouodckqvvninia.jpg"},"name":"SpongeBob's Boating Bash","platforms":[{"id":5,"name":"Wii"},{"id":20,"name":"Nintendo DS"}],"screenshots":[{"id":319791,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc6ur3.jpg"},{"id":319792,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc6ur4.jpg"},{"id":319793,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc6ur5.jpg"}],"summary":"SpongeBob SquarePants is in for the bumpiest ride of his life!
