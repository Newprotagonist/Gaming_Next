The player can both stand atop dice, and stand on the ground (with the dice towering above).

Creating a group of adjacent dice with identical pips—the size of which must be at least the number of pips—causes those dice to slowly sink into the field before disappearing. Chain reactions are possible by adding additional dice to a sinking set. Different types of dice are available in some modes, with different properties to make the game more challenging. \n \nIt was originally created by developer Shift on the \"homebrew\" Yaroze platform, and later turned into a commercial game.

Wolf from Bull Gator and his crony, Axl. Taz ventures away from his home in Tasmania and must pass through the Amazon Jungle, Amsterdam, Switzerland, the Greek Islands, China, Australia, and more. Those familiar with Taz's character on the Looney Tunes cartoons will recognize the fact that Taz hasn't lost his taste for strange and unusual objects as his food source and continues with that practice in his game. Taz literally has to eat his way through each level in order to advance to the next level. Food has significant importance how victorious Taz will be in his mission and even becomes functional at some points. The more food Taz consumes, the faster he will advance and the closer he will get to rescuing his friend. The road to the rescue will be littered with obstacles and challenges from Taz's enemies.

In contrast to most megawads, it is designed especially for cooperative multiplayer gameplay, although it can be played in single-player as well. It is also one of the few PWADs that are allowed to be used in Compet-N speedruns. The soundtrack was composed by Mark Klem, who also designed one level and co-designed another, and is available in a separate file named MMMUS.WAD. The phrase Memento Mori is Latin and is translated as \"Remember that you will die\" or \"Remember death\".\n\nIn 2003, this WAD was named one of the Top 100 WADs of All Time. However, it was erroneously listed as a 1996 WAD, when it was in fact originally released in 1995; 1996 was merely the release year of the final version.","tags":[1,268435461,536896999,536897000]},{"id":113090,"cover":{"id":71227,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co1iyj.jpg"},"name":"1001 Jigsaw.
