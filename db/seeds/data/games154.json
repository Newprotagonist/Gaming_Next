The game was developed by Media Molecule and published by Sony Computer Entertainment Europe for the PlayStation 3 console, and is the last major Little Big Planet game in the series to be produced by Media Molecule, as the sequel, Little Big Planet 3 would be produced by Sumo Digital, Tarsier Studios, and The Station. \n \nUnlike the original LittleBigPlanet which was marketed as a \"Platform game\", LittleBigPlanet 2 was marketed as a \"Platform for Games\". The game is 100% backwards compatible with all user-created content (including personal profiles) from the first game. It is a direct sequel to LittleBigPlanet, and the third game in the series. The disc also features Sackboy\u0027s Prehistoric Moves, a ModNation Racers demo, as well as a PlayStation Network tutorial video.",

Legend calls them the Ravenii, encroaching armies of bloodthirsty monsters standing 150 feet tall that once threatened to destroy humankind. Now the threat has returned, and only those trained in the ways of the ancient order stand a chance at defeating the ogres. You are one of the world‚Äôs last Sentinels, a soldier named Avil equipped with the skills to battle the endless wave of Ravenii. \n \nFight massive brutes and their minions across a sprawling countryside, defending cities and rescuing refugees torn from their homes. Swiftly define your strategy as hordes attack from the ground and air. Use the dynamic skill-based combat system to your advantage, tactically disarming and dismembering enemies to go in for the kill. This is no longer a war. It is an annihilation. And you are all that stands between humanity‚Ä¶and extinction.",

    "summary": "A rhythm-action game like no other from the same team that created WarioWare. Rhythm Tengoku contains 48 minigames that put your rhythm to the test in a variety of crazy scenarios.\n\nRhythm Tengoku was developed by Nintendo R\u0026D1 and released exclusively in Japan for the GBA in 2006 and in arcades with Sega\u0027s help in 2007. Being developed by the same studio responsible for the WarioWare games, Rhythm Tengoku mixes the mini-game based gameplay with rhythm game elements, featuring unusually high-quality music for a GBA game. The game started development in 2004. A 2002 prototype for a GBA drum sequencer was incorporated into Rhythm Tengoku as well: the player can freely drum within the Sound Test or take on 19 drum lessons. (Source)\n\nThe game contains eight stages with five rhythm games and one remix of the previous five each, adding up to 48 different mini-games total. Each game can be completed without hitting every note perfectly, although doing so will unlock various rhythm-related bonus games and modes, such as a drum set where you have to mimic what the drummer does.\n\nMuch like the Wario Ware series of games, Rhythm Tengoku is all about following your senses and trying to be aware of various cues in the visuals and audio. This emphasis on sense instead of language makes it quite easy for anyone to pick up and play, even though the game is entirely in Japanese (and consequently only available in the Asian region or through an import website).\n\nFor example, one of the game\u0027s levels has you rapping with a computer-controlled character. He\u0027ll speak a colour-coded Japanese phrase, and the player must press \u0027A\u0027 in different rhythms. Although the game explains what rhythms to do for which phrase, non-Japanese speaking players can watch hand movements on-screen to figure it out without the need for language.\n\nOccasionally, challenges will crop up, asking you to complete a level without any mistakes. Doing so earns you a certificate for that level, and a pink heart with a \u0027P\u0027 on it appears in that level\u0027s description.",

The player\u0027s only weapon is a magic wand that can be used to transform objects. The player first uses the wand on any object to acquire a \"wand pattern\", then he can transform anything (walls, ladders, monsters...) into said object. This can be used to create ladders to travel, get rid of monsters etc., though all transformed objects revert to their original form after a while. Some levels feature gray objects which cannot be affected by the wand.",

Players wield an arsenal consisting of a devastating Vulcan cannon, electrically charged lightning attacks, and missiles capable of decimating ground tanks and flying squadrons. Power-ups include increases in speed, power, shields, bombs, and point bonuses, with the primary weapon changing depending on the last red (cannon), blue (lightning), or yellow (missile) disk picked up.\n\nGekioh: Shooting King features three main levels of difficulty: Geki Mode (normal fire rate), Easy Mode (enemies have half the rate of normal fire and collisions aren\u0027t always fatal), and Hard Mode (double firing rate and stacked odds). Six bonus modes are available from the beginning of the game (no unlocking required) and offer diversity in gameplay. Modes include Comical (damage accompanied by a laugh track), Stingy (one aircraft and one special weapon), No Mercy (unerring enemy fire), Slow (slow enemy fire but rate-multiplied), Ancient (bleached out color to eliminate power-up recognition), and Pocket (block-shaped symbols in basic form).",

It involves the two protagonists Ratchet, a furry alien creature, and Clank, a nerdy little robot, going on a quest to find Captain Qwark and ultimately to help save the galaxy.\n\nRatchet \u0026 Clank includes many of the best features of previous similar games, but makes itself unique in a number of ways. Firstly each of the game\u0027s levels are huge sweeping vistas with extremely detailed buildings which are visible at all times (i.e. there is no distance fog). This means that a building on the horizon is not just a \"backdrop\"; in all likelihood Ratchet will be exploring it in a few moments time. Secondly, the game includes a number of sub-games, such as a space fight sequence and a number of turret shoot-outs which are akin to Missile Command in the first person.\n\nThe game has over twenty levels (planets) and includes as many real-time cut-scenes which tell the story. Also of note is that the story is non-linear, requiring the player to return to previous levels to complete objectives and to choose between multiple paths forward. There is also a respectable array of weapons, gadgets, and accessories to find or buy as the game progresses, which offer some unique gameplay features.",

Apart from the purely fictitious geography of our world, all game elements and scenes are based on the Anglo-Saxon period, 1200 A.D. And we haven\u0027t used imaginary elements like fabled creatures, either. The player takes on the role of an ordinary captain in the Palace Guard. A conspiracy against the king catapults the captain into a situation where he finds himself responsible for the defence of the last royal province. This is all that remains of the shattered kingdom, which has been split into numerous small principalities and fiefdoms. And now even the king himself, ensconced in his capital, is threatened by enemy armies. This is the starting point of your Middle Ages adventure. Now you must win back all those provinces which once belonged to your king.",

Trapped in an ancient forest, a young prince searches for a lost god. Here he befriends the spirit of a young girl and a volatile child, and they quickly find their destinies intertwined. Players control all three protagonists as they explore an overgrown fantasy landscape, meet its strange and wonderful inhabitants, and overcome the ancient magic and puzzles protecting it. All this is wrapped in an interactive, non-linear story that challenges allegiances and true intentions. In order to survive and bring balance to the forest, your combat, platforming and puzzle-solving skills will be put to the test!",

Like in the computer and PlayStation versions, Harry Potter\u0027s first year at school of magic Hogwarts is presented as a 3D action-adventure title. The game is organized into distinct days and nights: days mostly consist of lessons where usually Harry will learn new spells, but the more interesting stuff happens at night when Harry sneaks around the castle to do things like meeting Draco Malfoy for a duel, fighting a troll in the dungeons and other important scenes from the film and book. Most tasks involve platform sections, where Harry has to jump over chasms and balance along edges. Often, creatures will be in the way that have to be fought using the correct spells, and magic must also be used to solve the occasional puzzle. At night, Harry must watch out for prefects patrolling the floors of the castle to avoid getting sent back to the common room. There\u0027s also broomstick flying in the game, including a Quidditch match against Slytherin.",

Deadlocked is different in its counterparts in that it focuses more on shooting than platforming and puzzle elements. The game allows you to use two bots to fight along side you, which can be upgraded over time with better weapons and firepower.\n\nThere are 10 total weapons in the game, significantly less than the other games. However, modding these weapons is more emphasized than before, with different kinds of Alpha and Omega mods. Omega mods can be used on any weapon, and range from the freeze mod to the magma mod. Alpha mods are weapon-specific, and increase the rate of fire, ammo capacity, and power. The game also features online multiplayer.\n\nClank is not a playable character in this game, although he gives advice to Ratchet over his communication link.",

Take flight on a lethal, pimped-up jetboard, darting through the skies and blasting alien invaders with an explosive arsenal of extreme weaponry. Face off against massive, multi-stage bosses as you protect innocent civilians from being abducted and turned into mutants. An arcade classic for the next generation!\n\nJetboard Joust blends the spirit and intensity of 1980s arcade coin-op SMHUPs with the replayability and tactical elements of hardcore modern roguelikes. Don\u0027t expect a story. Do expect frantic, fluid, fast-paced 60fps action, big guns, and explosions!\n\nThe Jetboard: Leap from your jetboard like a boss to gain temporary invincibility and smash your enemies to smithereens. Destroy pretty much everything in your path. You rock.\n\nThe Enemies: Over fifty different enemies to outwit. Be prepared for them to come at you with all the game\u0027s weapons plus their own special attacks. Watch out for a few tributes to classic arcade games of the past too...\n\nThe Weapons: From the conventional to the ridiculous! Jetboard Joust offers over thirty powerful weapons, each with its own distinct advantages and upgrade path, to aid you on your mission and leave a path of total destruction in your wake. Get up close and dish out massive damage with the shotgun, wreak havoc with the cluster bomb, fry enemies to a crisp with the flame tornado or shock them into submission with the lightning bolt. You\u0027ll get a different selection of weapons with each playthrough and you\u0027ll need to master them all!\n\nThe Bosses: Defeat huge bosses in a series of grueling multi-stage battles and then steal their attacks for your own use. Rendered in exquisite pixel-art detail, these guys will test your weapon-handling and evasive maneuvering to their limits.\n\nThe Planets: Choose your own path through a multitude of battlegrounds across the surface of five different planets. Discover hidden treasure, upgrades and awesome new weapons. Adapt your route based on your playstyle, the weapons you unlock and the treasure you discover. Plunder cash from fallen enemies and use it to pimp up your jetboard, jetsuit and max out your weapons for a formidable arsenal. Are you up to the challenge?",

    "summary": "Metal Gear is considered to be the progenitor of the stealth game genre, it was also the first video game designed by Hideo Kojima, who also directed many of the later Metal Gear sequels. A heavily altered port was produced for the Famicom/NES (without Kojima\u0027s involvement). A remade version based on the original MSX2 game was released as a bonus game in Metal Gear Solid 3: Subsistence for the PlayStation 2 and, as a result, is also included in Metal Gear Solid HD Collection and Metal Gear Solid: The Legacy Collection.\n\nThe game revolves around a special forces operative codenamed Solid Snake who goes into a solo infiltration mission into the fortified state of Outer Heaven to destroy Metal Gear, a bipedal walking tank capable of launching nuclear missiles from anywhere in the world.\n\nThe player must navigate the main character, a military operative codenamed Solid Snake, through various locations, while avoiding visual contact and direct confrontation with patrolling guards. If the player is seen, the game enters the \"Alert Mode.\" In this situation, Snake must escape from enemy\u0027s sight in order to resume infiltration. The method of escaping varies depending on the circumstances behind discovery:\n\nIf Snake is seen and only a single exclamation mark appears over an enemy\u0027s head, only the enemies in the player\u0027s present screen will attack and Snake can escape by simply moving to an adjacent screen.\nHowever, if two exclamation marks appear over the enemy (or the player triggers an alarm by being spotted by a camera, infrared sensor or by using an unsuppressed weapon), reinforcements from off-screen will appear as well. Snake can only escape by eliminating all incoming enemies, going outdoors, or by entering an elevator.\nThe player starts the game unarmed, but eventually acquires firearms such as a Beretta 92F and an M79 grenade launcher, as well as explosives such as remote control missiles and landmines. Ammo and supplies for weapons are limited, but are replenished by picking up ammunition caches or additional supplies. Weapons can not only be used to kill enemies, but also to clear obstacles such as hollow walls and electrified floors. Snake can also use his fists to punch and defeat patrolling enemies. Occasionally, if the player defeats a guard with punches without alerting anyone, the defeated guard will yield a single unit of rations or an ammo box that can be picked up. In addition to enemy guards, the player will also be confronted by mercenaries who will challenge the player to combat, serving as the boss characters.\n\nThe enemy base consists of three different buildings, with multiple floors (including basement levels) within them. The player uses key cards and other items to unlock doors and explore new areas. Each door will only open to its corresponding key cards. Information can be obtained by rescuing hostages being held within the buildings. After rescuing five hostages, the player\u0027s rank will increase by one star (with the maximum rank being four stars), allowing for increased carrying capacity and maximum health. However, if a hostage is killed, the player is demoted to the previous rank.\n\nA transceiver is available for the player to communicate with their commanding officer, Big Boss, or one of the resistance members operating covertly near Outer Heaven (Schneider, Diane, and Jennifer). Each of Snake\u0027s allies specializes in a specific subject. The player must keep track of their allies\u0027 frequency numbers in order to contact them. All of the radio messages are dependent on the rooms where the player is located.",

The gamer plays a human escaping entrapment by Terminators. After escaping hostile enemy territory in the first mission, the player meets with John Connor, the leader of the Resistance. From that point on, one plays as a Resistance fighter. Skynet\u0027s uprising in 1990 has left most of humanity dead, with control in Skynet\u0027s hands. All around is death and decay, scattered with remnants of a past society shattered.\n\nFuture Shock is played in the first person perspective at all times. Each level in the game requires the player to solve a number of objectives before continuing to the next level, while fighting enemy robots with a wide variety of guns and grenades. Another obstacle in each level is the harsh terrain, as many areas contain too much radiation for the player character to remain alive. The terrain is navigated in three ways, \u0027on foot\u0027, in a jeep with a mounted cannon, or in an Aerial Hunter-Killer.",

In the first game, Sly was becoming a professional thief, but in Band of Thieves, he is a professional thief -- so he retains all of the moves from the first game. He also earns new moves and gains different items to assist him in his dark craft. The biggest upgrade comes in form of the new multi-character gameplay. Players might start a level as Sly, and then after completing a particular task, players switch to Bentley, and Murray, respectively.",

    "summary": "The main fighting game is best described as a polygonal Marvel vs. Capcom game, with some notable differences. Control wise, the game varies from other Capcom fighting games by only having four buttons (two punches and two kicks, which is closer to the SNK game format) rather than the standard six. A player chooses a team of two characters, and fights against another two character team. The actual fights, however, are one-on-one fights, with the partner only participating by being called in when a player has enough \u0027vigor\u0027 for a Team Up attack, done by pressing a punch and kick button of the same pressure. The Team Ups would be some kind of double team attack by the character and partner, or (for most female characters\u0027 Team Ups) would heal the main character or give them more vigor. After the end of a round, a player (win or lose) has a choice to fight the next round with the partner from the previous round, or to keep their main character in play. The \u0027vigor\u0027 meter (essentially a super meter) could go up to 9 levels, with Team Ups costing two levels and super moves from a single person all costing one level of vigor. Much like the Marvel vs. Capcom games, launchers can be done that allow air combos to be performed, with all characters having universal low and high launchers.\n\nThe game also had a few defensive techniques.\n\nTardy Counters acted much like Alpha Counters from Street Fighter Alpha, allowing a player to immediately counter-attack from a blocking position. However, the restrictions on Tardy Counters are very lax; any hard normal, special or super attack can be used to Tardy counter (Alpha counters are only limited to certain special moves for each character), and Tardy Counters do not cost any extra vigor to perform (Alpha Counters required at least a level of Super Combo gauge to do).\n\nAttack Cancels allowed a player to cancel an incoming hit simply by timing their own hit with the attack, which would cancel out both attacks (though it does not nullify the remaining hits of a multi-hit move). Also, one additional level of vigor is awarded.",

The game is played with the Wii Remote and Nunchuk attachment, and the action is seen from a first-person viewpoint. In battle, the player character is equipped with one melee weapon (such as a sword or spear) and one ranged weapon (such as a bow and arrow or cannon). The player can freely switch between melee and ranged weapons during combat. Attacks are performed through either pressing the attack button on the Wii Remote to attack single enemies, or motion-based attacks that can damage groups. The game also includes a competitive multiplayer mode for two players. Outside of combat, there are running sequences where the player must swing his/her arms with the Wii Remote and Nunchuk in hand to simulate the arms pumping in a running motion. Horseback riding is also included, with the Wii Remote performing the function of the reins while the Nunchuk is used as a whip.",

    "summary": "Elvira II: The Jaws of Cerberus is an adventure/RPG first-person game. You begin by choosing one of the four classes for your character (which determines your starting attributes, such as Strength, Intelligence etc.).\n\nFor movement, you click the arrows in the bottom-right corner of the screen. Collecting items can be done via clicking on them in the first-person view window and dragging them into your inventory. (You can also click the \"room\" icon to see all the items that you\u0027ve found in the room so far.) Should you encounter monsters, you fight by clicking on them. You can choose one of the four tactics (Normal, Defense, Fierce, Berserk) when fighting, and there\u0027s a number of different weapons you can find in the game. If you meet someone who doesn\u0027t want to murder you (a very rare occurrence) you can talk to him, though conversations are pretty simple and consist mainly of short phrases.\n\nAs you defeat monsters, explore the game world and cast spells (see below), you get experience. Once you have enough experience, you gain a level, and your attributes improve.\n\nThanks to Elvira\u0027s spellbook she gave you, you have the ability to create and cast spells. Some spells can be used to heal yourself, protect you in combat or damage your enemies, other are necessary to solve certain puzzles and make progress in the game. Creating a spell requires you to be of high enough level and to have the proper ingredients, different for every spell. The ingredients are usually gone forever once the spell is ready, so beware and don\u0027t use up any items vital for completing the game! Casting a spell requires you to use some amount of Power Points (PP), which regenerate automatically but slowly. What\u0027s more, you only get a limited number of castings when you prepare a spell, so don\u0027t waste them.",

It is a version of Spider. As of 2005, it was the most played game on Windows PCs, surpassing the shorter and less challenging Klondike-based Windows Solitaire.\nThe game was first included as part of Windows 98\u0027s Microsoft Plus! package and has been since featured on most subsequent versions of Windows. Spider Solitaire was not included in Windows 2000, but was added to Windows ME and later on Windows XP; the game gained popularity subsequent to its inclusion in the latter. Windows Vista again saw a new version, which was mainly unchanged in Windows 7. Finally, Windows 8 has another updated version available in the Windows Store as part of Microsoft Solitaire Collection but not bundled with the operating system.",

    "summary": "The programmers at Microsoft are porting a game from their operating system over to the Game Boy Color with MICROSOFT PINBALL ARCADE. This pinball game was great fun on the PC, and now it is in a form that can be taken anywhere. There are seven different tables that are actually representative of real boards made by pinball giant Gottlieb throughout the last century. Each board carries a different theme, whether it is space travel or a haunted house. The boards also contain a varying number of paddles and paddle locations to make each a different playing experience. The graphics in this version are not as shiny as its computer counterpart, but they do translate well to the small color screen. The sound effects and music remain largely the same, adding to the game\u0027s arcade feel. The cartridge also contains a short but detailed history of pinball and how it has evolved over the years. MICROSOFT PINBALL ARCADE gives players the classic game with enough boards and extras to keep even the experts busy for quite a while.",

While Jak is imprisoned, he undergoes experiments with Dark Eco under the command of the city\u0027s leader: Baron Praxis. Jak, along with previous prisoners in the city jail, were experimented on for Operation: Dark Warrior, a project that consisted of injecting prisoners with dark eco in order to give them super-human abilities to be used in Haven City\u0027s war against animalistic creatures called Metal Heads. Jak, the only prisoner to survive the experiments, is altered mentally and physically, turning him (temporarily under random and controlled spasms) into a deadly monster.",
