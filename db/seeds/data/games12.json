It is an unofficial, enhanced remake of Nintendo's Game Boy game Metroid II: Return of Samus (1991), borrowing the art style and overall feeling of the Game Boy Advance game Metroid: Zero Mission (2004). Shortly after the game's release, Nintendo sent DMCA notices to websites hosting AM2R; download links to the game were removed from its official website, but Guasti said that he still planned to continue working on the game privately. In September 2016, Guasti ended the development of AM2R after he received a DMCA takedown request from Nintendo.\n\nThe game follows Samus Aran, who aims to eradicate the parasitic Metroids from their home planet SR388. It includes several new features, including redone graphics and music, a map system, and new areas and minibosses. The controls were changed to be less \"floaty\", in line with the gameplay of later titles in the series. Video game journalists appreciated the game, frequently calling it impressive and commenting on the improved visuals compared to those of the original Metroid II, although one thought the conditions required to win battles against Metroids were too specific considering how often they occur. The game was nominated for The Game Awards 2016, but was later removed from the nominations page without notice.","tags":[1,18,268435464,268435487,536870984,536871389,536871937,536871945,536871971,536872059,536872287,536872916,536872961,536873819,536873833,536874296,536881013,536884130,536888422,536895036,536896416,536896986,536897016,536900335,536900372],"videos":[{"id":12322,"video_id":"IKxesrCU3kg"},{"id":12323,"video_id":"TvVkX9nXtqM"}]},{"id":58507,"cover":{"id":36052,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/fvzogeps4ka26w2n5njl.jpg"},"name":"Jumble Blocks","platforms":[{"id":6,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"},{"id":82,"name":"Web browser"}],"summary":"Block matching game from Jayenkai.","tags":[268435465,536872287,536873787,536875046,536875379,536876543]},{"id":99149,"name":"Make Zombies Great Again","platforms":[{"id":6,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}],"screenshots":[{"id":234714,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/pfjg8rojncxssjo0x0pl.jpg"},{"id":234715,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/ptpoyhpkblmziw7l35ce.jpg"},{"id":234717,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/xenm70p3bloitijw7ni1.jpg"},{"id":234718,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/bfn1zkb5ixji0wdzhpua.jpg"},{"id":234719,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/wp7uupffhjmi71gkdgji.jpg"},{"id":234720,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/hnpjjd52tjhizqb7xusi.jpg"},{"id":234721,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/svu4knhyl9sklkzuofqn.jpg"}],"summary":"Make Zombies Great Again is the beer pong of zombie shooters.

Each character has his or her own unique strength and weaknesses. For example, the Warrior is strongest in hand-to-hand combat, the Wizard has the most powerful magic, the Valkyrie has the best armour and the Elf is the fastest in movement.\n\nUpon selecting a playable character, the gameplay is set within a series of top-down, third-person perspective mazes where the object is to find and touch the designated exit in every level. An assortment of special items can be located in each level that increase player's character's health, unlock doors, gain more points and magical potions that can destroy all of the enemies on screen.\nThe enemies are an assortment of fantasy-based monsters, including ghosts, grunts, demons, lobbers, sorcerers and thieves. Each enters the level through specific generators, which can be destroyed. While there are no bosses in the game, the most dangerous enemy is \"Death\", who can not only drain a character's health, but is difficult to destroy.\nAs the game progresses, higher levels of skill are needed to reach the exit, with success often depending on the willingness of the players to cooperate by sharing food and luring monsters into places where they can be engaged and slaughtered more conveniently. While contact with enemies reduces the player's health, it also slowly drains on its own, thus creating a time limit. When a character's health reaches zero, that character dies.

Furthermore, with the inclusion of two separate versions of each character's sprite set, the game allows up to two players to select the same character (in Tower of Doom each of the characters could only be selected once), effectively giving the game 12 \"different\" characters to choose from. The two Clerics and two Magic Users also have subtle differences within their spell books. \n \nThe controls are using four buttons: Attack, Jump, Select (brings up a small inventory ring around the character allowing the player to choose what item is set in the Use slot) and Use. The Cleric, Elf and Magic-User also have two extra rings for their spells, with the Jump button used to switch from ring to ring. While the game uses the same kick harness as the previous game, the Select and Use buttons are reversed. \n \nShadow over Mystara also introduced a selection of special moves which are executed by moving the joystick and tapping the buttons in certain combinations, in a way similar to the Street Fighter series.

It is the official successor to Rail Simulator, and was released online on 12 June 2009 and in stores on 3 July 2009. \n \nCompared to Rail Simulator, RailWorks contained new rolling stock, tools that previously had to be downloaded separately, graphical advancements such as modification of the existing content, bug fixes, backwards compatibility and the ability to trade elements from the virtual world with other users online. The first release of RailWorks contained all of the five real-world routes of the original European and North American releases of Rail Simulator, and added three new fictional routes: a large UK goods yard, a route set in the Alpine region and a route based around Denver, Colorado. \n \nIt is a Steamworks title, which means it uses and requires Steam to activate and to deliver core game updates. Steam is also used to deliver additional routes and locomotives in the form of DLC. The core game has received several free updates since release, including major new versions RailWorks 2: Train Simulator in 2010, RailWorks 3: Train Simulator 2012 in 2011, Train Simulator 2013 in 2012, Train Simulator 2014 in 2013, Train Simulator 2015 in 2014 and Train Simulator 2016 in 2015.","tags":[268435469,536872060,536875730,536880100],"videos":[{"id":23009,"video_id":"OqVrwzJ6nvI"}]},{"id":50092,"cover":{"id":167383,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co3l5j.jpg"},"name":"Ymir","platforms":[{"id":6,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}],"screenshots":[{"id":110800,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/s68injokcyq1qfpebmgd.jpg"},{"id":110801,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/cw8vvzdx4xzjbvshpjvj.jpg"},{"id":110802,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/up2yl9kosk42eafuhpci.jpg"},{"id":110803,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/hmrvlcge6mroshukwb2w.jpg"},{"id":110804,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/yoxl0jigzdzmn8wsw5i6.jpg"}],"summary":"Ymir is a 4X multiplayer strategy game combined with a city builder where each player develops a civilization of pigmen starting at the stone age.","tags":[268435467,268435469,268435471,268435488,536871906,536872060,536872383],"videos":[{"id":25590,"video_id":"5cFTYZNNgqo"}]},{"id":185775,"aggregated_rating":60.0,"cover":{"id":200437,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co4anp.jpg"},"name":"Baby Storm","platforms":[{"id":130,"name":"Nintendo Switch"}],"screenshots":[{"id":703499,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scf2tn.jpg"},{"id":703500,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scf2to.jpg"},{"id":703501,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scf2tp.jpg"},{"id":703502,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scf2tq.jpg"},{"id":703503,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scf2tr.jpg"},{"id":703504,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scf2ts.jpg"}],"summary":"Baby Storm is a cooperative party game.

The story is told from the perspective of a producer in charge of training 10 prospective pop idols on their way to stardom, and each version of SP features different idols. One reason for dividing SP among three versions when developing the games was to allow players to buy the version which features their favorite idols. Rival idols were introduced into SP because the development team felt that rivals are essential for The Idolmaster, which also serve to deepen the bonds between the player and an idol.\n\nIncluding downloadable content, the game features 54 songs the idols perform: 34 songs in original versions and 20 remixes of those songs, which have been released on several music albums.","tags":[268435463,268435469,536870955,536871080,536871094,536871186,536872026,536872452],"videos":[{"id":5112,"video_id":"Wzv0yldrNJ4"}]},{"id":143360,"cover":{"id":130460,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co2snw.jpg"},"name":"Sakura no Uta -Sakura no Mori no Ue o Mau-","platforms":[{"id":6,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}],"screenshots":[{"id":421567,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc91a7.jpg"},{"id":421568,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc91a8.jpg"},{"id":421569,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc91a9.jpg"},{"id":421570,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc91aa.jpg"},{"id":421571,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc91ab.jpg"}],"summary":"Spring.

After 12 years Stronghold returns to the deserts of the Middle East circa 1189, with a new 3D engine and realistic castle destruction powered by Havok Physics. Crusader 2 will recapture the original game’s addictive, fast-paced gameplay and authentic castle simulation. \n \nTrue to its roots this new Stronghold will define old school real time strategy, combining RTS and city builder gameplay. Playing as a brutal Crusader Knight or Arabic freedom fighter, you must use a deadly array of troops and destructive siege equipment to decide the fate of the holy lands. Lead your forces into battle as either Richard the Lionheart or the Sultan of Syria in two historic single-player campaigns, with dynamic events such as tornados and locust swarms. Become the greatest Lord by managing your desert economy and seizing control of vital oases. \n \nTo dominate the battlefield you will need to command more than 25 unique unit types, mastering their special abilities. Raise morale with the Sergeant at Arms, charge in with the Sassanid Knight, use Archers to launch an arrow volley or scale castle walls with the deadly Assassin. Once your skills have been perfected put them to the test in skirmish mode or take the battle online with up to eight players.

It is the first entry in the NBA Jam series. The main designer and programmer for this game was Mark Turmell. Midway had previously released such sports games as Arch Rivals in 1989, High Impact in 1990, and Super High Impact in 1991. The gameplay of NBA Jam is based on Arch Rivals, another 2-on-2 basketball video game. However, it was the release of NBA Jam that brought mainstream success to the genre.\nThe game became exceptionally popular, and generated a significant amount of money for arcades after its release, creating revenue of $1 billion in quarters. In early 1994, the Amusement & Music Operators Association reported that NBA Jam had become the highest-earning arcade game of all time.\nThe release of NBA Jam gave rise to a new genre of sports games which were based around fast, action-packed gameplay and exaggerated realism, a formula which Midway would also later apply to the sports of football (NFL Blitz), and hockey (2 on 2 Open Ice Challenge).","tags":[268435470,536870970,536871049,536872078,536872352,536874371,536875073,536875186,536875610,536875615,536875659,536875749,536875870,536876348,536876410,536876546,536876820,536877099,536877458,536877459,536877466,536877487,536877551,536878107,536878545,536879197,536879750,536881357,536882470,536883675,536885414],"videos":[{"id":7697,"video_id":"YQRVtXT7xxU"}]},{"id":36398,"cover":{"id":72921,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co1k9l.jpg"},"name":"Assault Squad 2: Men of War Origins","platforms":[{"id":6,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}],"screenshots":[{"id":97890,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/xv0kqt1mwaqnblkxm9cs.jpg"},{"id":97891,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/iyizjys6ejyn6fsbcesl.jpg"},{"id":97892,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/wakc56l6rc1prvmnzggk.jpg"},{"id":97893,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/wx3ehmtgzytdxbv9bspx.jpg"},{"id":97894,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/awnbf4dc0nsrc2mjqzuh.jpg"}],"summary":"1C Company and Digitalmindsoft present Assault Squad 2: Men of War Origins, the modern remake of the original bestselling Men of War RTS","tags":[1,268435469,268435471]},{"id":43822,"cover":{"id":47143,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/cjgcxtltqn1c0mnffyut.jpg"},"name":"NCAA March Madness 2000","platforms":[{"id":7,"name":"PlayStation"}],"summary":"NCAA March Madness 2000 was the 1999 installment in the NCAA March Madness series.

The player can only be hit twice before losing a life (the first hit takes away Arthur's armor, and the player must continue on in his underwear until completing the level or finding replacement armor). If the player loses a life, he is returned to the start of the level, or the halfway point if he has managed to get that far. Furthermore, each life can only last a certain length of time (generally around three minutes), the clock being reset at the start of a level. If the clock does run out, the player instantly loses that life.","tags":[1,19,268435464,268435487,536870928,536871208,536872032,536872957,536873991,536874743,536875046,536875073,536875091,536875261,536875372,536875418,536875778,536876032,536876348,536876413,536877072,536877427,536878203,536880327,536880859,536898541,536901279,536901402],"videos":[{"id":66473,"video_id":"P7CdqiHHPpQ"}]},{"id":74331,"cover":{"id":102535,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co2747.jpg"},"name":"Viaerium","platforms":[{"id":6,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}],"screenshots":[{"id":129161,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/ge7o8h93hsxivkirftnc.jpg"},{"id":129162,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/wpkm0xh9z2vsu3vmkvme.jpg"},{"id":129163,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/qmtkzpojb5fmkegqts3w.jpg"},{"id":129164,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/eaux92fzfjzf49edbnzf.jpg"},{"id":129165,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/itdxe0srvoxayikaz1wg.jpg"}],"summary":"Viaerium is a peaceful 3D Platformer about a beautiful journey to fullfill your Dream.","tags":[268435487,268435488]},{"id":48994,"cover":{"id":212540,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co4jzw.jpg"},"name":"Great Greed","platforms":[{"id":33,"name":"Game Boy"}],"summary":"Great Greed is a Role-Playing game, developed and published by Namco, which was released in 1993.","tags":[268435468,536871208,536871938,536872105,536872407,536874398,536875074,536875258,536875261,536875755,536875886,536876416,536877559]},{"id":120796,"cover":{"id":76148,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co1mr8.jpg"},"name":"Immortal Love: Kiss of the Night","platforms":[{"id":6,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"},{"id":14,"name":"Mac"}],"summary":"When your beloved falls ill, you'll do anything to save her.
