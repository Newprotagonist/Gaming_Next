Interactive Entertainment and DC Comics. It features a story arc from the movie, which was released on June 28, 2006, and more than 60 years of comic book content. EA Tiburon, known for its Madden NFL game series, has claimed that the game combines strong creative vision and compelling new technology to deliver a powerful and emotional gaming experience to their consumers, and they will experience a real sense of flying while mastering Superman\u0027s superhero powers to save Metropolis.\n\nIn the game, Superman combats Bizarro, who does not appear in the movie, as well as other classic villains (including Mongul) as well as being able to play as Bizarro for a short period of time in one of the many minigames inserted into the game. The game was produced for the Xbox 360 as well as the Playstation 2 and Nintendo DS. A port for the PlayStation Portable was planned but cancelled due to it not having enough power to support the game.\n\nElectronic Arts and Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment secured an all-star cast for the voices in Superman Returns: The Videogame. The game features the voice and likeness of Brandon Routh(Superman/Clark Kent) as well as the voices of Kevin Spacey (Lex Luthor), Kate Bosworth (Lois Lane), Parker Posey (Kitty Kowalski) and Sam Huntington (Jimmy Olsen), all reprising their roles from the Warner Bros. Pictures film directed by Bryan Singer.",

You can also explore the depths of space, where hidden missions and unexplored territories await. The galaxy is a vast and beautiful place. And space is not empty: There are thousands of star systems, planets, moons, nebulas, wormholes and asteroid fields waiting to be explored and exploited. Each sector of the universe offers a unique variety of resources and procedurally generated content. \n \nSelect the right ship for your journey from hundreds of different hulls, with different size, speed and and capabilities. Customize your spacecraft further with extra skins and models. Select your loadout from thousands of modules, weapons, rigs and equipment.

The choice of skill is entirely up to the player, there are no mutually exclusive skill branches. Skills do not limit access to modules and ships, but they augment their specialization and effectiveness. \n \nThere are four major NPC factions: The Foundation, The Tauri Dominion, The Solar Empire and The Kerrats. Together with countless minor factions they vie for control over the galaxy, constantly trying to gain the upper hand over one another on their home frontiers. But outside the core systems, in the majority of the galaxy anarchy reigns supreme and everything is free to be taken.

Where Buster Bros. may be described as an action game, TranscendPang takes the basic \"Pang\" format and turns it into a frantic shoot \u0027em up experience. The soundtrack features several artists from the Japanese doujin and rhythm game scenes.",

Unfortunately you need to get to the top of these towers to blow them up.\n\nYou make your way up to the top of the tower via walkways around the outside of the towers. You need to jump over, kick, and run from various enemies in your journey to the top. Most vertical movement is achieved by jumping onto moving ledges at the right moment.\n\nThe game was considered revolutionary in its time for its graphic technique. As the main character walked around the outside of the tower, the character was fixed in the middle of the screen while the tower itself rotated. This gave it a pseudo-3D effect.\n\nTowers are linked together via a voyage through the sea in your trusty MK.7 submarine. This plays out as a side-scrolling collect-\u0027em-up in which bonus points can be obtained.",

Effects are collected in a gloomy, sublime dreamscape and the user is left to interpret the events and lack of explicit storyline. The only differences that seem to set this game apart from Yume Nikki is the more concrete subject matter (the deeper aspects of the landscape seem to have a more pristine resemblance to human body parts, where as Nikki\u0027s environment requires more interpretive thinking to analyze) and the inclusion of three endings instead of one. \n \nThe main plot of the game is similar to the original Yume Nikki\u0027s, in that it\u0027s a sandbox game with very few exploration restrictions. You must collect the twenty-five effects to unlock two of the three endings and three boxes to achieve the third.",

    "summary": "Featuring three retro machines and their modern-day counterparts, the Old Vs New Car Pack showcases the lineage of three major manufacturers - Ford, BMW, and Ruf. \n \nIntroduced in 1964, the Ford Mustang quickly became one of the company\u0027s most-recognizable models, single handedly starting the Muscle car revolution that shaped the American car market for more than a decade. \nAfter the first one million road cars of the original Mustang had been build, Ford gave its best-seller an extensive upgrade, equipping the car with a more powerful 4.7 liter V8 engine and introducing the now-iconic Fastback body style. \nNow, in 2015, the Mustang GT is the newest addition to Ford’s iconic range. Powered by a massive 5-liter V8 engine and delivering more than 428hp of power and 528 Nm of torque, buyers can choose between a full manual and automatic six-speed gearbox, the latter coming with genuine shifting paddles – a first in the long history of the Mustang. \n \nBased on the Porsche 911 3.2, the 1987 CTR Yellowbird is one of Ruf’s most iconic models that has helped build Ruf\u0027s reputation for building no-compromise sports cars. The 3.4 liter twin-turbocharged flat six engine provided 469hp from two large turbo chargers \u0026 intercoolers and had been equipped with a new Bosch Motronic as well as an ignition setup originally designed for Porsche’s 962 Group C race car. Thanks to extensive weight-saving measures such as usage of fiberglass and aluminum, the CTR weighs just 1150 kilograms, resulting in a very impressive performance. \n \nBMW\u0027s 2002 Turbo road car made the history books in 1973 by becoming Europe\u0027s first-ever mass-produced road car powered by a turbocharged engine. The 2002 Turbo\u0027s two-liter four cylinder engine provided 170hp of power, a figure that made the 2002 one of the most powerful cars on the road during its time. Unfortunately, the 1974 oil crisis forced an end to the 2002 Turbo\u0027s production after just one year as gas prices were soaring across the world. Only 1672 cars were produced during the model\u0027s limited production run, making the 2002 Turbo one of BMW\u0027s most iconic and most sought-after classics. \nBuilt to the Super 2000 touring car regulations, the 320TC is BMW\u0027s weapon of choice for competition in the World Touring Car Championship (WTCC) and countless national touring car series around the globe. \nWeighing 1170 kilograms, the car is powered by a 1.6 litreDI-turbo four-cylinder engine and a full adjustable six-speed sequential gearbox. Driven by veteran touring car aces such as Tom Coronel, Franz Engstler \u0026 Stefano D\u0027Aste, the 320TC clinched five world championship wins.",

However a scientist named Dr. Minimizer has an idea: using a device he calls \"The Minimizer Ray\", he will shrink the planet\u0027s population to 1/360 of its original size, and so create a world more suitable to our current status. If this is to be successful, the doctor needs to create a supersoldier: somebody who can prepare the planet for us when we are eventually minimized. In order to do this, the doctor enlists the help of 12 volunteers for an experiment. The experiment consists of racetracks that are considered various dangerous environments as to ascertain the suitable skills for the supersoldier.",

With over 150 different monsters, many with unusual attacks, you will find plenty of sticky situations!\n\nThe procedurally-generated dungeon and vast array of possible items gives immense replay value. Some games you\u0027ll find a good weapon early, other times you\u0027ll rely on wands or potions or spells.\n\nYou don\u0027t see it much in the all-action video above, but some of the most fun is had just standing still trying to work out how to get out of a sticky situation. Should you try that unknown potion? Maybe it\u0027s Healing? What about that wand? Maybe it\u0027s Magic Missile... or maybe it\u0027s a Wand of Create Monster, and it\u0027ll get even stickier!\n\nYou start with your choice from 16 character classes, each with different starting equipment, stats, belief system, and available talents. The game you play also depends very much on what interesting loot you find. Maybe you\u0027ll find a great spellbook and put all your efforts into turning your uneducated knight into a master battle mage!",

We lampoon some of the current directions and movements in the game industry with regard to profitability, privacy, independent development, and intellectual property controversies. After a few quick set-up steps, players can choose one of 1000 possible games from a list of randomly generated titles and enjoy the truly mind-blowing graphics that await. Each unique game experience is only available once and may just challenge your notions of what is “legal” in terms of games and their possible social meanings. What are you waiting for?... DO IT!!",

Suddenly, a powerful bolt of magic has robbed Kuros of his armor, memory, and honor. But the distant presence of evil stirs in his mind, leading him to the once fair city of Piedup, the very same place where the villainous soul of Malkil survives. Without his armor, Kuros will need crafty disguises to travel undetected, ready to do battle as a wizard, nobleman or thief. His quest will take him from the depths of the dungeon to the palace containing riches beyond belief - building strength, perfecting fighting skills and acquiring rare knowledge of magic along the way. The time has come for Kuros to turn his visions of power... into reality!",

It is the fourth game in the Puyo Puyo series and the last set during the Madou-era in the main series. \nContinuing the trend of naming the games after puns, the name comes from a pun on \"yon\", the Japanese word for the number 4, but this time this is the only reference to the pun. \n \nThe gameplay in is similar to that of Puyo Puyo 2, but adds super attacks. Clearing chains now builds up a \"charge meter\" which allows players to use them. The only other addition was a new game mode which could be played with a number of different field sizes, smaller or bigger than the standard 6x12, however, it removes several game modes that were present in Puyo Puyo Sun, i.e. the tournament, task and chain training modes. The art is also vastly different to the previous game in the series and, of course, the Fever series; this style was only otherwise used for Minna de Puyo Puyo. \n \nSTORY: \nSatan has released an odd demon called Pierott. Pierott invites Arle and Carbuncle over to the “Puyo Puyo Circus”. All seemed to be just fine, Arle and Carbuncle went into a tent to watch a magic show, but Satan had Carbuncle volunteer for a magic trick he was doing. A magic trick? Or a trap? He puts Carbuncle on the stand, and casts a spell, which makes Carbuncle, disappear! Arle wasn\u0027t worried, she didn\u0027t even know what was going on, but later on, she couldn\u0027t find Carbuncle anywhere! She then has to start battling monsters and oddball characters in a match of Puyo Puyo to try to reach Satan, and get Carbuncle back!",

Each of the four elemental realms consists of two stages. In the first stage, Kuros must find a golden artifact which belongs to the Animal King of the realm; once accomplished, the path to the second part of the realm will appear. In the second stage, the goal is to find the magic spell which can be used to fight the elemental boss. Without the spell, it is impossible to damage the boss. Once the elemental in each stage has been destroyed, Kuros obtains a piece of the legendary Iron Sword, which is needed for the final battle on Icefire Mountain.",

Now, the aliens from that planet are invading Earth, and its up to Sally to save the day! Unlike most breakout games, the game isn\u0027t over if the ball touches the ground. Instead, the player has to avoid various projectiles shot by enemies. If they get hit, they get a strike, and three strikes means they\u0027re out! With plenty of power-ups, 70 exciting levels, 8 bosses, and a full-blown level editor, Aliens Go Home Run is breakout like you\u0027ve never seen it before.",

Colonies of humans called Rifters have been exploring the \"Frontier\" of planets, but find their way of life threatened by the Outcast, a ruthless species of humans who have mutated into psychotic monsters due to exposure to this very same Rift Energy. Caught in the middle is Emmett Graves, a hired gunslinger ostracized from society because of his own exposure to Rift Energy, leaving him partially mutated, but still able to retain his humanity. Graves is drawn back to his home settlement to face a mysterious outlaw and his war band of Outcast warriors.\n\nStarhawk provides fast paced third-person shooter action set in this lawless frontier of space, allowing players to instantly alter the battlefield by calling down offensive and defensive structures in real-time from an orbiting drop ship, all while blasting away at enemies in the middle of huge single-player or multi-player firefights.",
