So begins this adventure of a hip skunk and his 30 levels of platforming action, taking him through the sky, across land, underneath the ground and over water. Multiple paths and bonus levels will offer some variety in this throwback to 2D platform games of the past.\n\nIn order to succeed, Punky must use various moves to fight enemies, avoid traps and find the flagpole signifying the end of the level. In addition, you'll be able to collect stars and 1-ups for extra lives, green orbs to replenish health, and gear icons outfitting Punky with one of six pieces of equipment: Paraglider, Inline Skates, Skysurfer, Pogo Stick, Jetpack or Diggers. Besides using the gear, Punky can either jump or attack enemies with his \"spray.\" Skunk got you stumped? Not to worry, you can resume progress at the start of each cleared stage if you have a memory card.","tags":[1,268435464,536872961,536880037,536894067]},{"id":8942,"aggregated_rating":47.5,"cover":{"id":9338,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/n464mkoxfnjf38wume56.jpg"},"name":"Seven Kingdoms: Conquest","platforms":[{"id":6,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}],"screenshots":[{"id":27805,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/p3w0nrg9vyvcpzqqjzrh.jpg"}],"summary":"Seven Kingdoms: Conquest is a new chapter to the series that is based on a campaign between the Demons and Humans.","tags":[17,268435467,268435471,536870914,536871208,536871438,536871717,536871905,536872383,536874694,536876390,536883035]},{"id":75941,"cover":{"id":106151,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co29wn.jpg"},"name":"BattleRush","platforms":[{"id":6,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}],"screenshots":[{"id":135371,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/av3wfjcrbbu8r1rmuk5e.jpg"},{"id":135372,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/rizwsibrlqcnbksifijq.jpg"},{"id":135373,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/x4lbuxdnvrfjjloaahmu.jpg"},{"id":135374,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/al7osqraiyqx7of198qt.jpg"},{"id":135375,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/xuclea0vhwo9his2yy76.jpg"}],"summary":"Free-to-play multiplayer action game in the entourage of the Second World War with total destructibility of the environment.

They will place treasures, enter dialogue and create events that are triggered by certain actions within the game world.\n\nAlthough players can create nearly anything they like with the game, it must be more or less contained in a fantasy theme, as the only graphics available adhere to that specific genre.

Also contained within RPG Maker is a mode called Anime Maker, where those with the desire can create 2D pictures and animate them accordingly.","tags":[17,268435468,536872255,536898390]},{"id":42732,"cover":{"id":177130,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co3soa.jpg"},"name":"Dirt Racer","platforms":[{"id":19,"name":"Super Nintendo Entertainment System (SNES)"}],"summary":"Players must drive their dirt track racing vehicle across a road rally.

Upon its release the game attracted little attention from either critics or consumers, though it has received some attention since and, arguably, cult status.\n\nThe game featured combined 3-D graphics, stop motion animation and video segments. With its unconventional interface, storyline, and characters, the game's peculiarity became its selling point. The characters are largely lifelike in appearance except for their clay-modeled faces, which are often distorted or feature grotesquely exaggerated features. This near-realism, sometimes referred to as the uncanny valley, contributed to the game's ambience of unease and anxiety.\n\nThe character animation is stop-motion. Inscape did the art design of the puppets (lead artist Bruce Heavin) and had a Hollywood house actually make them. Inscape then hired two stop-motion animators and Russell Lees spent many, many hours in a hot, dark warehouse directing the animations. The working hours were from 7 am to 7 pm for about a month. They created computer-generated screenshots of the environments and shot against blue-screen, and they had a director of photography light them to match the environment.\n\nAlso notable was the use of author William S. Burroughs as a voice actor: Burroughs provided not only the voice for the character of Edwin, but also voiceovers of two slide-show sequences illustrating the short story \"The Masque of the Red Death\" and the poem \"Annabel Lee\". Another story, \"The Premature Burial\", can be found while reading the newspaper during \"The Tell-Tale Heart\", and the poem \"To Helen\" can be read while playing the victim in \"Berenice\".\n\nThomas Dolby composed the game's music.\n-------------------\nStructurally, the game was a point-and-click adventure fueled by the macabre stories of Edgar Allan Poe. The player could experience three of the stories (\"The Cask of Amontillado\", \"The Tell-Tale Heart\", and \"Berenice\") from the perspectives of both murderer and victim.\n\nThe game presented no choices to make, no life-or-death decisions, and no points; similar to other point-and-click adventures like Myst, the game simply waited for the player to find the next hotspot or location, at which point another video would play to advance the plot. During the portions that were direct interpretations of Poe's stories, the player was constrained to follow the actions of the stories' characters. The player could carry only one item at a time.

A level based game. Every level consists of a labyrinth of colored pathways, scattered valuables, locked doors, keys, a thief (the player), on some levels an opposing thief and a door marked exit. The goal is to reach the exit to proceed to the next level, valuables can be 'stolen' for score. If the opposing (computer controlled) thief reaches the exit before the player, the game is lost. Movement is not possible between differently colored tiles, unless a special, multicolor 'bridge' stone is used. 99 levels total.\n\nSpring weekend. A rotation puzzle, where a given pattern needs to be recreated by rotating elements on the playfield.\n\nLineup. Using 'Tetris' style blocks, a continuous line from a screen border to an opposite screen border needs to be build. Elements appear on an element stack, and can be selected freely from that and subsequently placed anywhere on screen, without overlapping each other. If the element stack is full, the game is over. As soon as a line is complete, the elements of that line are removed from the screen. Elements appear faster over time.\n\nFinty Flush. A grid on top of the screen fills slowly with multicolor balls. The player can pick one out of 4 squares on the bottom of the screen to shift balls in one line into and out of these squares. The squares can be rotated in 90 degree steps. As soon as any square is completely full with balls of the same color, its content empties to make room for more balls. 3 filled square grids grant a bonus point, and the next level begins (tiles appear faster). The game is over when the upper grid is full.\n\nColor Collision. A 'Qix' style ray ( no better way to describe this - for the younger audience - imagine a flapping fan ) moves with increasing speed through a screen full of obstacles. The player can only indirectly control it - any time the direction pad is pressed, it gets 'reflected' into the direction that has been indicated. Objective is to hit obstacles with a given color and pattern, avoiding all other elements. To top things of, the patterns change over time. The game ends if the wrong obstacles have been hit too many times.\n\nRat Poker. Little differently colored rats are automatically fed into labyrinths, with labyrinth design changing and getting more complex during level progression. Switches allow rerouting of the rats to arrange certain color combinations ('hands') of rats. If a given combination is achieved, the contributing rats exit the playfield through a door. You progress to the next level if a given number of rats has been removed from the game. The game ends if there is no space left on the playfield for additional rats.\n.","tags":[35,40,268435465,268435471,268435491,536874694,536875093],"videos":[{"id":52224,"video_id":"Mr2gXJpGBL0"}]},{"id":48926,"cover":{"id":224226,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co4t0i.jpg"},"name":"Spider-Man 3: Invasion of Spider-Slayers","platforms":[{"id":33,"name":"Game Boy"}],"summary":"Spidey's in a web of trouble!

Players can also trade generals and view stats using online capability.","tags":[22,39,268435469,268435471,268435472,268435480,536872015,536874694,536875160,536875162,536875762,536876054,536876056,536876410,536877520,536877740,536880117,536880234,536880799,536883333,536884230]},{"id":834,"aggregated_rating":85.0,"cover":{"id":111473,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co2e0h.jpg"},"name":"Port Royale: Gold, Power and Pirates","platforms":[{"id":6,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}],"screenshots":[{"id":393754,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc8ftm.jpg"},{"id":393755,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc8ftn.jpg"},{"id":393756,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc8fto.jpg"},{"id":393757,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc8ftp.jpg"}],"summary":"Port Royale is an economic trading sim set in the Caribbean in the 17th century.

These monsters can then be tested in in-game tournaments, or made battle against other players's ones in two-player mode (by the GBA link cable).\n\nMonsters are created in the game's shrine through the entry of letters, numbers and punctuation symbols. Players begin with the ability to enter up to 4 characters to make monsters, and can unlock the ability to use up to 8 characters through gaining higher trainer ranks. Different words or combinations of characters can not only make different types of monsters, but also each monster can have varying attributes and characteristics, making each one unique.\n\nPlayers then train the monsters by choosing which foods to feed them with, which drills to do to raise attributes, what training to send them to for learning new attacks, and what items to give them. The game starts with a modest amount of money with which food and items can be purchased; more money is earned in tournaments. Gameplay revolves around planning training sessions, adding new attacks and juggling the bank account, along with attempting to win tournaments. As monsters age, they can be added to a coaching staff to help raise new monsters to better attributes, or they can be combined with other monsters to make stronger babies. Monsters do not die in this game, however they do face an enforced retirement age.\n\nThere is a storyline, where some characters from older Monster Rancher games are back, and new characters are introduced. The gameplay itself, like most other Monster Rancher games, is open-ended.\n\nThe two-player mode, requiring the link cable and two copies of the game, allows players to test the monsters they have raised against each other. It also allows players to trade items and cash money, to wager items or cash on tournaments, and trade raised monsters bringing them into each others' game files.","tags":[268435468,268435469,536870990,536871423,536872060,536877991,536880696]},{"id":136014,"cover":{"id":136339,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co2x77.jpg"},"name":"The Legend of Heroes: Trails of Cold Steel IV - Frontline Edition","platforms":[{"id":48,"name":"PlayStation 4"},{"id":130,"name":"Nintendo Switch"}],"summary":"The Erebonian Empire is on the brink of all out war!

After being humiliated once again by his rival, Jeff \"Crash\" Cooney and his blue-collar buddies from Southside High School at the All-City Track Meet, he has decided to issue a challenge to Crash. Inviting two of the other elite high schools to participate in the challenge, plus an additional team sponsored by his wealthy father, Todd has seemingly stacked the deck against Crash and his boys. The game has four different teams to choose from, as well as a fifth computer-controlled team. Each team have five members each with their own strengths and weaknesses, making some better suited to certain events than others. Before each event, players have the opportunity to go shopping in the mall to buy power-ups for their characters. These items are paid for through the various medals that each team achieve as they progress through the challenge, but since the winner of the challenge is the team that collects the most medals overall, players must be fairly judicious in how much they spend. There are two types of events in the game: individual events (Hammer Throw and Roof Top Jumping) and head-to-head events (400 Meter Hurdles, Swimming and Fighting). In individual events, each team takes turn individually and ranking is determined by who gets the most points. The head-to-head events take place under a single elimination tournament format, in which one player against another in a series of heats. The player who successfully defeats both of his opponents will get to compete against a member of Team Thornley for first place. The game can be played by up to four players. Since there's never more than two teams competing at the same time, the third and fourth player can play simply by alternating between the two controllers. Thus, a four player adapter is not required, unlike other Kunio-kun games.","tags":[1,268435460,268435466,268435470,536872078,536872581,536872594,536875046,536875131,536875290,536875300,536875361,536875434,536876348,536876353,536877431,536882429]},{"id":28727,"cover":{"id":67715,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/ia5ih7wdi2amzbyolpjd.jpg"},"name":"Blueprint Tycoon","platforms":[{"id":3,"name":"Linux"},{"id":6,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"},{"id":14,"name":"Mac"}],"screenshots":[{"id":58144,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/upi3dnvwolhnfqz7yocl.jpg"},{"id":58145,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/fleuximi4qrthyx9kbze.jpg"},{"id":58146,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/vzutyxemghqzojabuhq5.jpg"},{"id":58147,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/hkfok66tqw0t5oaoyvih.jpg"},{"id":58148,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/amrbiacosxx4kah738wq.jpg"}],"summary":"Build your settlement, gather goods, ensure maximum efficiency and make a profit! \n \nIn Blueprint Tycoon you are tasked with running a settlement by gathering raw materials and crafting them into complex goods to be supplied to your contractor for a profit. \n \nCreate your own Blueprints for each Crafter/Harvester using multiple Workers with a multitude of Tools and try to create the most productive Blueprints. \n \nProfit margins are razor thin so you must focus on ensuring peak efficiency at every point of your supply chain, if something breaks you must be swift in managing your cash flow before your treasury runs out and you face the wrath of unpaid Workers! \n \n \n \nPlan your Island for maximum efficiency \nHire workers and keep them happy, fed and most importantly, paid \nColonize other Islands and set up trading routes \nResearch new products to supply more profitable contracts \nMaximize productivity by creating your own Blueprints \nManage your supply chain and keep everything working at peak efficiency \nOptimize your contracts for maximum profit!","tags":[28,268435469,268435488,536871013,536871029,536871518,536871906,536872060],"videos":[{"id":21580,"video_id":"iOO5vPm1MsA"}]},{"id":77673,"cover":{"id":120015,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co2klr.jpg"},"name":"Net de Bomberman","platforms":[{"id":8,"name":"PlayStation 2"}],"screenshots":[{"id":408759,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc8ref.jpg"},{"id":408760,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc8reg.jpg"}],"summary":"Bomberman, which continues to attract many fans with its simple gameplay, has finally become a network battle!\n\nMoreover, it is possible to play up to 8 players this time!\n\nIf you connect to the net, you can have a heated battle not only with your usual friends but also with many rivals on the other side of the net!","tags":[1,268435489,536872661,536874743,536875262,536893590],"videos":[{"id":42920,"video_id":"Mw-MKTAVI4E"}]},{"id":982,"aggregated_rating":49.0,"cover":{"id":189541,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co4291.jpg"},"name":"Heavy Fire: Afghanistan","platforms":[{"id":5,"name":"Wii"},{"id":6,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"},{"id":9,"name":"PlayStation 3"},{"id":12,"name":"Xbox 360"},{"id":14,"name":"Mac"}],"screenshots":[{"id":140404,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/czeeosmgb0cadnjbwyts.jpg"},{"id":140405,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sxxvaxbiql3pqfkv5nfg.jpg"},{"id":140406,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/ay2vplmulazqpnereg5q.jpg"},{"id":141378,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/ublklryepdykh20bfiz5.jpg"},{"id":141643,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/fujxztvqobalhp5utevr.jpg"}],"summary":"Heavy Fire: Afghanistan is a super fast playing on-rails shooter set in modern-day Afghanistan featuring tanks, assault vehicles and helicopters.

The game is a sequel to Renegade and was followed by Renegade 3. When acquiring the license to convert the original arcade game Renegade to home computers, Ocean acquired the option to produce and release their own home-computer-only sequels to the game, and Target Renegade was the first of these sequels.\n\nOn most formats, the game caters for one or two players and concerns itself with the adventures of a streetfighter (or a pair of identical streetfighters) known only as \"Renegade\", who seek(s) revenge against a local crime kingpin named \"Mr. Big\" for murdering his or their brother Matt. The player character varies, depending on the format, but is usually represented as topless apart from a leather vest and wearing jeans.\n\nRegardless of the format, the cover of the game and the title screen (as seen on the image to the right) portrays a topless street fighter performing a flying kick through a window. In keeping with video game box art and advertising of the era, the character shown in this illustration bears little relation to any character in the game itself. The actual picture is based on Martial Arts Legend Joe Lewis from the cover of his book The World's Greatest Fighter Teaches You How To Master Bruce Lee's Fighting System, but has been adjusted so as to fit in with the character of Renegade.\n\nThe game comprises five levels, though details of enemies and weapons vary from one version to another (the NES version in particular is more like Double Dragon than the home computer versions). The NES and C64 versions of the game do not have a two-player co-operative mode.","tags":[1,268435460,268435481,268435489,536870969,536871470,536871894,536871971,536872211,536872581,536872587,536873017,536873064,536874398,536875073,536875331,536875358,536875361,536875414,536875420,536875538,536875655,536875803,536876120,536876232,536876756,536877220,536877281,536879220,536879691,536880704]},{"id":13336,"cover":{"id":218328,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co4ogo.jpg"},"name":"Aspar GP Master","platforms":[{"id":13,"name":"PC DOS"},{"id":15,"name":"Commodore C64/128"},{"id":16,"name":"Amiga"},{"id":25,"name":"Amstrad CPC"},{"id":26,"name":"ZX Spectrum"},{"id":27,"name":"MSX"},{"id":63,"name":"Atari ST/STE"}],"screenshots":[{"id":399826,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc8kia.jpg"}],"summary":"Grand Prix Masters was a one-make motor racing series featuring retired Formula One drivers.

Get your unicycle from A to B as quickly as possible, and finish ahead of your opponent. It's like Sonic, but with none of those pesky enemies, pointless power-ups and frustrating obstructions. In fact it doesn't sound like much of a game at all...\n\nHere's the key, though. Tricks performed and landed during the race increase your speed. The better the trick, the greater your increase in speed will be.\n\nAlso, some levels are set in areas designed solely for stunts. Such levels require you to earn as many style points as possible, by doing tricks. These levels are against the clock, and a set points score, rather than an opponent.\n\nUnicycles are stupid and difficult, and yet fun, once you get the hang of them.

After numerous wars and several environmental disasters, only two world powers remain; the United Civilized States (»UCS«), covering the American continent, Western Europe and North Africa, and the Eurasian Dynasty (»ED«) covering the coherent landmasses of Eastern Europe and Asia. The damage caused by the long wars led both world powers to evacuate the population to recently built underground cities.\n\nAustralia and most parts of Africa were sacrificed during the long wars, which lasted several decades. Highly toxic biological and chemical weapons were developed on these continents, leaving them so badly contaminated, that no human life can survive there. Not even the use of robots and machines is possible. The general opinion was that these continents would forever remain uninhabitable, and they were wiped from every map. Most of the world's population forgot that this land ever existed.\n\nNatural resources are becoming scarce and have to be extracted above ground.
