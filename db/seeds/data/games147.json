It was the first of two Contra games that were externally developed by Appaloosa, followed by C: The Contra Adventure in 1998. The game marks the series' jump to three-dimensional graphics and controversial changes in gameplay. Legacy of War was released packaged with a pair of 3D anaglyph glasses, which the game supported. Legacy of War bears the distinction for being the first console game in the series to retain both the Contra title and human characters during its release in Europe and Australia (where the console series has been known as Probotector from the first NES game and up until Contra: Hard Corps). The game was scheduled to be released in Japan as well, but was canceled.","tags":[1,18,268435461,536870913,536870915,536871133,536871487,536871882,536871937,536872733,536873064,536873753,536874398,536874743,536875073,536875171,536875258,536875303,536875358,536875606,536875610,536876283,536880079,536884403]},{"id":84935,"cover":{"id":212696,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co4k48.jpg"},"name":"Y.A.S.G","platforms":[{"id":41,"name":"Wii U"}],"screenshots":[{"id":440786,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc9g42.jpg"},{"id":440788,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc9g44.jpg"},{"id":440790,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc9g46.jpg"},{"id":440792,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc9g48.jpg"},{"id":440793,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc9g49.jpg"}],"summary":"Defend your planet!

Gunthro is a third-generation smitemaster, and a rather ugly man. Smitemasters are hard-bitten, muscled veteran dungeon exterminators that slay hideous beasties in dark places for a living. You know Gunthro will get the job done, and you'll happily pay him for it because you can tell he's The Guy. When the Rasarun king is slain by an officer of Tueno, Gunthro is recruited by Rasarus to defend his country and reclaim its honor. However, as Gunthro searches deeper, he will find that things are not quite as they seem.\n\nDROD: Gunthro and the Epic Blunder is designed as an entry-level offering to the DROD world, with both new players and veterans in mind. The level layout is designed to be more forgiving, with multiple hub areas to explore. The game starts easy, has a smooth learning curve and an integrated online hints system. If DROD has seemed too difficult for you to get far into, then you should be pleased by the design that went into this game, making for a delightful blend of fun and challenge.

With powerful barons jostling for power over a disintegrating kingdom, it is up to you to stem the tides of ambition and unite the land under the one true King! \n \nBuilding on the sim gameplay of the original Stronghold, Stronghold 2 allows players to rule as they please and still conquer each skirmish. Unhappy peasants turn to crime and must be punished, rival lords can raise entire armies on their title alone and sieges must be fought tooth and nail, with close combat taking place inside castle structures. Stronghold 2 Online extends this gameplay to competitive multiplayer for up to eight players, with offline skirmish mode also available against computer-controller opponents. \n \nThe online services used GameSpy which was shutdown. The Steam Edition is the only version of Stronghold 2 that still features multiplayer using Steam Multiplayer.","tags":[1,22,33,39,268435467,268435469,268435471,536871063,536871139,536871470,536871906,536872060,536872074,536872315,536872352,536872383,536872387,536872817,536872914,536873066,536873473,536874694,536875197,536875229,536875257,536875304,536875324,536875331,536875372,536875523,536875525,536875667,536875775,536875778,536875784,536875803,536875901,536876315,536876390,536876399,536879783,536880177,536880294,536880645,536881651,536882045,536883035,536884045],"videos":[{"id":8364,"video_id":"bhIuVgKfD7E"}]},{"id":159454,"cover":{"id":170776,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co3nrs.jpg"},"name":"Medieval Apocalypse","platforms":[{"id":6,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}],"screenshots":[{"id":553208,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scbuuw.jpg"},{"id":553209,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scbuux.jpg"},{"id":553210,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scbuuy.jpg"},{"id":553211,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scbuuz.jpg"},{"id":553212,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scbuv0.jpg"},{"id":553213,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scbuv1.jpg"},{"id":553214,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scbuv2.jpg"},{"id":553215,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scbuv3.jpg"},{"id":553216,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scbuv4.jpg"},{"id":553217,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scbuv5.jpg"},{"id":553218,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scbuv6.jpg"},{"id":553219,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scbuv7.jpg"},{"id":553220,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scbuv8.jpg"},{"id":553221,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scbuv9.jpg"},{"id":553222,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scbuva.jpg"},{"id":553223,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scbuvb.jpg"},{"id":553224,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scbuvc.jpg"},{"id":553225,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scbuvd.jpg"},{"id":553226,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scbuve.jpg"},{"id":553227,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scbuvf.jpg"},{"id":553228,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scbuvg.jpg"},{"id":553229,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scbuvh.jpg"},{"id":553230,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scbuvi.jpg"},{"id":553231,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scbuvj.jpg"},{"id":553234,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scbuvm.jpg"},{"id":553237,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scbuvp.jpg"}],"summary":"The main goal in Medieval apocalypse is not only to survive as in previous survival games where you had to watch over the hunger, thirst, fatigue but the player will have to watch out for infection caused by zombies to not become one of them.","tags":[1,268435469,268435487]},{"id":155706,"cover":{"id":195922,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co476a.jpg"},"name":"Potion Permit","platforms":[{"id":6,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}],"screenshots":[{"id":522093,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scb6ul.jpg"},{"id":522094,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scb6um.jpg"},{"id":522095,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scb6un.jpg"},{"id":522096,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scb6uo.jpg"},{"id":522097,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scb6up.jpg"},{"id":522099,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scb6ur.jpg"},{"id":522101,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scb6ut.jpg"},{"id":522103,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scb6uv.jpg"},{"id":522105,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scb6ux.jpg"}],"summary":"Moonbury's residents need healing, and you're the best chemist around!

Be a Star Viking.\n\nIn Star Vikings Forever you will build your team of spacefaring Vikings to take on the evil scourge of intergalactic snails in a fun and nearly endless stream of challenging puzzles.\n\nBest Indie at Google Play Best of 2017, Finalist at the Google Play Indie Games Festival, Winner for \"Best Game Design\" at the Brazilian Independent Games Festival, and “Most Offensive Game Ever” at the Space Snails Game Conference. Star Vikings Forever is a humorous Puzzle/RPG developed by the award-winning creators of Chroma Squad, Dungeonland, and Relic Hunters Zero.\n\nPosition your team of uniquely built Vikings to strategically attack enemies, and clear the board. Enemies aren’t the brightest, and will attack each other whenever they are attacked. This creates a very satisfying chain-combo system, where you can wipe entire boards with a few moves to clear a path to advance to the next stage, or to complete a specific objective.\n\nTake your time and strategize, or for faster paced combat, make multiple moves simultaneously.

The bundle also includes a souvenir sticker, a video interview with Atari founder Nolan Bushnell, press releases from the original games and images of game memorabilia. Atari Anniversary Edition Redux is mouse and analog control compatible and is multi-tap adaptable for up to four players. \n \nIn addition to the pure emulation modes, there is an option to display the cabinet art surrounding the display of each game, intended to give the player a sense of actually playing a stand-up machine. \n \nEach game also has a toggle for an \"enhanced\" graphical mode, which varies from game to game. For instance, \"enhanced\" asteroids merely has a static backdrop, whereas \"enhanced\" warlords is a complete graphical overhaul with new colors.

And so began massive purges of the deviants that were reminiscent of the “witch hunts” of centuries earlier. Leading the genocide was the exorcist corps the “Gun Bullet Children”.\n\nAs the overwhelmingly large human armies began to obliterate every vampire and deviant community across the world, the opposing deviant armies sought to gather allies and rally back. Lia Fyle is a half-human, half-vampire girl fighting on the side of the deviants as they embark upon a turnaround strategy, the “Siege on the Holy Land’. Their plan: to lay siege upon the humans’ “Holy Land” and to destroy the Holy Lady Anhel who was the source of the human military power. This is a battle in which defeat is an option for neither army.\n\nFeaturing an addictive dual-polarity gameplay system, this amazing vertical shmup is sure to please any shooter fan. The polarity and color of your character can be changed to absorb enemy bullets of the same polarity while charging the special weapon in the process and doing double damage to enemies of the opposite polarity. Every bullet absorbed charges your special weapon for total destruction. With awesome music, beautiful art, and challenging stages, this is the game that put the eXceed series on the map and has everything you would want from a shmup.","tags":[1,17,268435461,268435488,268435489,536870990,536871078,536871123,536871200,536871823,536871971,536872070,536872147,536872406,536872591,536875046],"videos":[{"id":11564,"video_id":"BKCo5PJzF1A"},{"id":11565,"video_id":"6_4ooEhyou8"}]},{"id":27571,"cover":{"id":182129,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co3wj5.jpg"},"name":"Train Sim World: CSX Heavy Haul","platforms":[{"id":6,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}],"screenshots":[{"id":37452,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/e5c8oyyntchxbyfjzcx6.jpg"},{"id":37453,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/vvly9gk2gzloveui2tk6.jpg"},{"id":37454,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/vwmxz6cvkcalaod7at4f.jpg"},{"id":37455,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/jvhxfwocoqsrrkgxf0s8.jpg"},{"id":37456,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/cdglqvgjxyu6pejiaxny.jpg"}],"summary":"Train Sim World: CSX Heavy Haul is an all-new First Person Simulator that brings to life the experience of operating powerful and heavy freight trains on one of America's most stunning and famous railroads; Sand Patch Grade.","tags":[268435469,536871827,536871906,536872060,536875058,536875059,536875269,536875730],"videos":[{"id":12489,"video_id":"Jq6fWlOUirs"}]},{"id":27190,"aggregated_rating":62.0,"cover":{"id":140417,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co30ch.jpg"},"name":"Cooking Mama: Sweet Shop","platforms":[{"id":37,"name":"Nintendo 3DS"}],"screenshots":[{"id":44228,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/juidmcxekiuazwdxgevl.jpg"},{"id":155404,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/ciaicouu1qrrnh3tbe1k.jpg"},{"id":155405,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/xbjf9uwar6zw4lne5i8n.jpg"},{"id":155406,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/yplf461kedqm75ggxm1z.jpg"},{"id":155407,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/oq1nt4jlhtvbcd98g3lk.jpg"},{"id":155408,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/pknjr1n7zssvxjya55yt.jpg"},{"id":155409,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/zailbikgkjawbu8no1ak.jpg"},{"id":155410,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/cla0hi0yxr9t82qymszv.jpg"},{"id":155411,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/n2pz3ai78oxumtmc2zfb.jpg"},{"id":155412,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/c0of5qgmnn0hmjtoctsf.jpg"}],"summary":"In Cooking Mama: Sweet Shop players make and create a wide assortment of delicious looking sweets and puddings, and serve customers in the shop to keep them happy!

In addition to navigating the main characters around the mansion grounds, players are able to enter Viewfinder Mode, where the camera is raised and the view changes to that of the camera's frame. In viewfinder mode the player is able to snap photographs of ghosts, both violent and benign, which is the main method of progressing through the game. Items are also available, some being consumable and most being key items needed to unlock doors, complete tasks or solve puzzles. Puzzles are encountered frequently in the game, some being based on the same concept but becoming progressively more difficult. The varying difficulty settings of the game (Easy, Normal, Hard, Nightmare, or Fatal (Xbox only)) determine the amount of consumable items scattered throughout the mansion and how formidable the enemies are.\n\nThe main horror aspect of the game is, undoubtedly, the ghosts. The mechanics programmed for the ghosts allow them to float ethereally through the air, walls and floors, and even teleport, allowing them many ways to attack the player. The ghosts' appearances are usually inspired by their deaths or by Japanese stigmas of horror, which, some argue, are particularily chilling.\n\nThe game, depending on which console it is played on, offers two endings. Upon completion of the game, a ranking is given based on total time taken, points accumulated and other categories. The player is also given rewards and unlockables, such as alternate costumes and camera functions, depending on what difficulty was beaten, how much of the Ghost List was completed and other criteria. Beating the game also unlocks Battle Mode, where the player is faced with fighting specific ghosts, and is rewarded with points towards purchasing unlockables. An option is also given where the game can be replayed with all equipment, upgrades and unlockables carried over.","tags":[19,21,268435487,536870928,536871088,536871183,536871213,536871251,536871470,536871945,536872032,536872225,536872746,536872748,536872822,536873712,536874398,536875057,536875178,536875249,536875265,536875553,536875833,536876087,536876088,536876090,536876121,536876169,536876187,536876235,536876538,536876631,536876836,536877230,536877237,536877641,536878097,536878512,536879895,536879905,536880712,536880805,536882438,536884207,536888127,536891502,536891503],"videos":[{"id":5450,"video_id":"BTEEsY8lMx0"},{"id":37393,"video_id":"MFvtcdo3co0"}]},{"id":2268,"aggregated_rating":82.5,"cover":{"id":130623,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co2ssf.jpg"},"name":"Monster Hunter Tri","platforms":[{"id":5,"name":"Wii"}],"screenshots":[{"id":27551,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/krngpqlegzndpfqwzgtc.jpg"},{"id":166042,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/zjsdvpgvqgdtm8izz7ft.jpg"},{"id":166043,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/xc0ujjld1rdf1ndgqxbe.jpg"},{"id":166044,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/zzmlqfbna3xf1jkpegwc.jpg"},{"id":166045,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/togkk5cna7nr9ycd0mvm.jpg"},{"id":166046,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/y1zrr4cr7u0qnh0mbwnq.jpg"},{"id":166047,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/celyfu2iny6rr97hzuc6.jpg"},{"id":166048,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/zuiseev3wsq9aupfqsya.jpg"},{"id":166049,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/ab9o2tbzkvuelbpkamrj.jpg"},{"id":166050,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/u68lrcpwiqmg1kahdc3x.jpg"},{"id":166051,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/ltyqgcduym1qe9zakhcy.jpg"},{"id":166052,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/rhiuwkxfkglsgexetufu.jpg"}],"summary":"Monster Hunter Tri depicts an ecosystem where man co-exists with fantastic beasts that roam both the land and the sea.

If one of the columns would reach the bottom, the game is over.\n\nThe player has a cursor at the bottom which can be used to select a particular column, pull blocks into that cursor the bottom, move the cursor to a different column and push the blocks back to the top. Multiple blocks can be moved at once, but they have to be the same type. As soon as the column of at least 5 blocks of the same type gathers together, this group annihilates, freeing up space on the playfield, thus making it possible to continue the game.\n\nDrop-Drop was initially developed and published in Russia; the only known names attached to the project are programmers Vladimir Ryshov and Grigory Sragovich. The game was included in the Moscow Nights game compilation, which released in (at the very least) the United Kingdom and Germany.\n\nData East learned of Moscow Knights and obtained a license for Drop-Drop, using it as the basis of what would eventually be known as Magical Drop.

There is no RPG iteration of the game, unlike with previous titles.","tags":[1,17,23,268435461,536871059,536871138,536871208,536871226,536871470,536871506,536871937,536871945,536872182,536872198,536872205,536872214,536872352,536872390,536872450,536872550,536872668,536872695,536872715,536872883,536874743,536875046,536875054,536875081,536875083,536875157,536875199,536875254,536875265,536875271,536875275,536875316,536875342,536875350,536875437,536875438,536875488,536875492,536875523,536875525,536875536,536875610,536875623,536875650,536875700,536875743,536875760,536875791,536875804,536875831,536875941,536876036,536876171,536876184,536876260,536876285,536876363,536876445,536876476,536876695,536876770,536876808,536876816,536877029,536877030,536877149,536877204,536877211,536877286,536877993,536877998,536878369,536878441,536878531,536879211,536879591,536879698,536879758,536879769,536880068,536880223,536880360,536880907,536882488,536883375,536883426],"videos":[{"id":17477,"video_id":"3qQw5qjrrCs"},{"id":17478,"video_id":"74oPbZyHYJY"}]},{"id":76412,"aggregated_rating":0.0,"cover":{"id":71311,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co1j0v.jpg"},"name":"Songbird Symphony","platforms":[{"id":6,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"},{"id":14,"name":"Mac"},{"id":48,"name":"PlayStation 4"},{"id":130,"name":"Nintendo Switch"}],"screenshots":[{"id":248014,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/pdip2l0mjwkngbawdkca.jpg"},{"id":248015,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sgwly85lsod9kq2q5zva.jpg"},{"id":248016,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/ivh9dixw7inwskl2gdjj.jpg"},{"id":248017,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/qblnnv0z72aergsfzl3j.jpg"},{"id":248018,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/lgcdbckqxtlwhig2kmts.jpg"},{"id":248019,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/c8o7amdnprhlzuypdmqo.jpg"},{"id":248020,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/y6zbxluegmpsbemf45uw.jpg"},{"id":248021,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/fpnams2bdy10gnosuhks.jpg"},{"id":248022,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/vqslm5qouqjcxjeafavn.jpg"}],"summary":"\"Songbird Symphony is a 2D musical adventure game depicting the tale of a young bird named Birb as he leaves the safety of his nest to confront the outside world and discover his true identity.

Gameplay comprises a familiar mix of storytelling and monster raising, with significant tweaks implemented for good measure. The town acts as your base of operations and it's here you can stock up on supplies, or take jobs for which you can earn money and build a reputation. The latter proves vital as it's directly related to the number of monsters you can use in battle. The successful completion of certain tests rewards you with the ability to command more beasts -- up to a maximum of 12 at once, however, you can only take these tests when your reputation is high enough. \n \nThese trials take place in the Arena, which is also home to Beast Hunter battles, where you can test your mettle against fellow Beast Hunters. Monster eggs are found on your travels and can be hatched in the Room of Life; an all-encompassing monster management room that provides detailed information on the beasts and allows you to merge them, creating hybrid creatures. The monsters now also evolve over time. Your amulet consists of 12 slots, three for each of the four elements. Your creatures are placed in positions on the amulet corresponding to their position in battle, and during combat they'll attack the enemy and defend you from harm. Their amulet position also dictates the effectiveness of their elemental powers. \n \nThe storyline starts 100 years after the original adventure, with the Cocoon Masters having become the stuff of myth and legend. Beast Hunters are the modern equivalent, and players take on the role of Kahu; an aspirant Beast Hunter. A chance encounter results in Kahu being cursed, and he, along with a fairy named Nico, must rid his body of the curse or die. Levant (the original title's protagonist) is now a guardian and acts as your guide.","tags":[1,17,268435468,268435487,536870990,536871022,536871208,536871327,536871409,536871423,536871489,536871938,536871939,536875196,536875284,536875455,536875523,536875525,536875791,536875829,536875882,536875952,536876847,536878084,536878225,536880171,536880256]},{"id":75326,"cover":{"id":107624,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co2b1k.jpg"},"name":"Empire Deluxe Combined Edition","platforms":[{"id":3,"name":"Linux"},{"id":6,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"},{"id":14,"name":"Mac"}],"screenshots":[{"id":133184,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/xiotkezq8d72jnmet02a.jpg"},{"id":133185,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/ehoxsorv1rybfdeh36es.jpg"},{"id":133186,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/v4pdguuy5rvjrbvs3wn3.jpg"},{"id":133187,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/xfqwtuo38d1aeryhyoal.jpg"},{"id":133188,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/oynge6zsbdvuj5mh6o0j.jpg"}],"summary":"Empire Deluxe Combined Edition is the latest in the classic Empire Series of games, which has spanned almost five decades.\n\nEmpire Deluxe is a game about taking cities.

Humanity has been reduced to a few survivors inhabiting the orbital space station Omega. Over the course of the history, aliens visited the Earth every twenty-five years, \"harvesting\" humans as an organic material. Eventually, they launch an assault on the last remnants of the human race. But Adam Drake, a genetically engineered soldier, comes into possession of a time-traveling device. He uses it to travel to the time periods of human history when aliens performed their deadly attacks. The fate of humanity is in his hands.\n\nBody Harvest is an action and driving game with a mission-based structure. The protagonist travels to various locations and eras (e.g. Greece during World War II, Siberia in the 1990s, etc.) with the goal of stopping alien invasions. Missions can be accessed by traveling to specified areas on the map. Adam can move on foot and use his weapons to kill aliens; however, vehicles usually prove to be a more reliable way of tackling most missions. Adam can use most of his weapons while in a vehicle; in addition, some vehicles are outfitted with their own weapons.","tags":[1,18,38,268435461,268435487,536870933,536870981,536871041,536871082,536871113,536871213,536871644,536871859,536871882,536871945,536872371,536872619,536872647,536872651,536872695,536872733,536873023,536873111,536873874,536874743,536874947,536875271,536875358,536875437,536875483,536875484,536875572,536875621,536875839,536876028,536876274,536876287,536876564,536877263,536877325,536877501,536879995,536881457,536884032,536884033,536884403,536897818,536897960]},{"id":202317,"cover":{"id":222807,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co4rx3.jpg"},"name":"One-Way","platforms":[{"id":6,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}],"screenshots":[{"id":798114,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sch3tu.jpg"},{"id":798115,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sch3tv.jpg"},{"id":798116,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sch3tw.jpg"}],"summary":"One-WAY is a Yume Nikki fangame.

The game was released in North America on February 28, 2002 for the Xbox console.\n\nTapout was published by Crave Entertainment and developed by DreamFactory. The subtitle Tapout refers to a fighter tapping his hand indicating that he has submitted to a submission hold. A tapout, along with a knockout, judge's decision, and referee stoppage, is one of the ways of ending a UFC bout.\n\nThe game features many of UFC's top stars including Matt Hughes, Chuck Liddell, Mark Coleman, Frank Shamrock, and Tito Ortiz. Competitions can take place in several modes such as exhibition, tournament, arcade, and championship mode. Several fighters throughout the game are unlockable such as two female competitors and celebrity Ice-T.\n\nUFC: Tapout received generally lukewarm reviews from critics. A sequel to this game entitled UFC: Tapout 2 was released in 2003. Other than an updated roster, the game is very similar to the first Tapout and received similar reviews. Tapout 2 was published by TDK Mediactive. Both games have an ESRB rating of T for Teen.","tags":[268435460,268435470,536871019,536871623,536871683],"videos":[{"id":64712,"video_id":"oD0FX_8lk-c"}]},{"id":114603,"name":"Wings of Glass -玻璃の羽-","platforms":[{"id":6,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"},{"id":14,"name":"Mac"}],"screenshots":[{"id":285051,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc63y3.jpg"},{"id":285052,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc63y4.jpg"},{"id":285053,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc63y5.jpg"},{"id":285054,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc63y6.jpg"},{"id":285055,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc63y7.jpg"},{"id":285056,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc63y8.jpg"},{"id":285057,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc63y9.jpg"}],"summary":"Mayfly, a girl with glass wings, is kidnapped by Ferace, a giant demon.

The publisher has emphasized how hard it's trying to get things right this time, and for many, it couldn't have chosen a better game. \n \nJet Set Radio was part of Sega's onslaught of new properties with an emphasis on flash and style during the second wave of Dreamcast software, but it might be one of the more obscure. It's a game that almost everyone has heard of, but I think few have actually played. This was remedied somewhat with 2002's Xbox sequel Jet Set Radio Future. Unlike Sonic Adventure or the arcade hit Crazy Taxi, Jet Set Radio HD is the chance for many to finally play a game they've only heard about. \n \nNostalgia has the side effect of high expectations though, and Jet Set Radio HD just can't meet them. While the flash and style of Jet Set Radio HD remains untouched and unvarnished by a dozen years of progress, the rest of it can't stand up to scrutiny. Squirrely controls, camera catastrophes, and nonsensical level design make Jet Set Radio HD a better memory than game.","tags":[1,268435463,268435464,268435466,268435470,268435487,268435489,536871881,536871988,536872331,536873352,536874992,536877099,536888787,536898773,536898774,536898775,536898777,536898778],"videos":[{"id":9446,"video_id":"Yvca4CoW0C0"},{"id":47241,"video_id":"AjgVITVl0E4"}]},{"id":178215,"cover":{"id":191378,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co43o2.jpg"},"name":"ThreeTwoPix: Fang Runner","platforms":[{"id":6,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}],"screenshots":[{"id":671705,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sceeah.jpg"}],"summary":"Run your way through New Fang City, collecting diamonds, avoiding paperhands and jumping over awful flippers.\n\nAn endless arcade runner, can you beat the community highscore?","tags":[1,21,268435487,268435488,268435489,536897746,536899155,536902052,536902053,536902054]},{"id":12211,"aggregated_rating":72.5,"cover":{"id":79914,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co1pnu.jpg"},"name":"Metal Gear Acid","platforms":[{"id":38,"name":"PlayStation Portable"}],"screenshots":[{"id":13202,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/ot1hrsmi6hzqayzemlmo.jpg"},{"id":13203,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/nqpihqttikwcwl5uqqxd.jpg"},{"id":13204,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/oxtxedmsvbjqfdcponjl.jpg"}],"summary":"METAL GEAR AC!D, is a turn-based collectible card, It was the first game in the Metal Gear series for the PSP. A Java ME version for mobile phones was released by Glu Mobile in 2008 titled Metal Gear Acid Mobile. \n \nAcid focuses on turn-based tactics, using a trading card-based system to control the main character's movements and actions. Acid in the name stands for \"Active Command Intelligence Duel\". The cards are not truly collectible, as the game is complete with a single purchase. However, the game does feature deck design and deck optimization elements. The game allows for multiplayer gameplay by wireless ad-hoc connections of two PSPs. \n \nBefore each round, the player can customize the deck of cards used by the main characters. The majority of the cards are based upon elements spanning the entire Metal Gear series, such as weaponry, characters, and even the Metal Gear itself. When the game is started, the player's hand can consist of a maximum of six cards. The maximum number of cards in a deck increases with overall progress. In action mode, the player can choose to use the cards as they are intended or use them to move the character. Most cards only allow the player to move three spaces, while certain cards let the player move up to six or higher. \n \nCost is an important factor in game play and can be summed up as the weight of the player's action. With some exceptions, all cards have a cost attached to them and when used this cost transfers to the player. Cost varies radically from card to card. The higher the cost a character has, the longer that character must wait until their next turn. For example: if a player character has a cost of 15 and a guard has a cost of 10, then the guard's turn would occur before the character's. \n \nSome cards can be equipped; cards such as weapon cards, can have other cards attached to them in order to improve performance. In order to fire the weapon, another weapon card that uses the same kind of ammunition must be equipped. Some weapons don't need to be equipped and can be used by themselves, however they are discarded afterwards. Other cards that can be equipped include equipment cards and action cards. \n \nMultiplayer, or \"Link Battle\", is also a new feature. Two PSP systems running Acid can link wirelessly, allowing players to face each other in a \"sneak-off\". The objective is to collect a certain number of diskettes before the rival player. Diskettes can be stolen by another player, so there is an emphasis on avoiding detection.","tags":[23,268435471,268435472,536871394],"videos":[{"id":5395,"video_id":"KR2pfqpj7vo"}]},{"id":148099,"cover":{"id":203893,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co4dbp.jpg"},"name":"Wood Block Escape Puzzles","platforms":[{"id":130,"name":"Nintendo Switch"}],"screenshots":[{"id":450790,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc9nty.jpg"},{"id":450793,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc9nu1.jpg"},{"id":450796,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc9nu4.jpg"}],"summary":"Tease your brain in this challenging puzzle game where the player must move the red block all the way to the right side of the game board.
