Impressively the game has a high resolution 640x480 mode that does not require the add-on N64 RAM Expansion Pak. Additionally, unlike many other games of its type on the platform, the game runs high resolution at a sufficiently playable pace, undoubtedly due to the use of a reduced screen area letterbox mode that lessens the number of pixels needing to be displayed.","tags":[268435466,536873390,536875069,536876703,536879193,536884031]},{"id":201012,"cover":{"id":221469,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co4qvx.jpg"},"name":"The Lucid Dreamer Bundle","platforms":[{"id":169,"name":"Xbox Series X|S"}],"screenshots":[{"id":792357,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scgzdx.jpg"},{"id":792358,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scgzdy.jpg"},{"id":792359,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scgzdz.jpg"},{"id":792360,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scgze0.jpg"},{"id":792361,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scgze1.jpg"},{"id":792362,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scgze2.jpg"},{"id":792363,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scgze3.jpg"},{"id":792364,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scgze4.jpg"}],"summary":"Sherlock Holmes Chapter One + The Sinking City Bundle\n\nUse your mind to investigate and your willpower to resist madness."},{"id":32104,"cover":{"id":32083,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/ajlsxwnxvvnxaf6edumc.jpg"},"name":"Pulse Shift","platforms":[{"id":6,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}],"screenshots":[{"id":52031,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/w6wmq1qynblbpyh8bhjd.jpg"},{"id":52032,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/zz5gvpsfp9wj1qzblgja.jpg"},{"id":52033,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/twaznt5xb5ffszp81zx8.jpg"},{"id":52034,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/aj10l0nsfukxjfnjijgx.jpg"},{"id":52035,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/ptsqyijefurllsjrk4jv.jpg"}],"summary":"Crazy physics toy with various of abilities such as gravity and time manipulation in many abstract levels.","tags":[268435464,268435465,268435488,536872961,536873787,536875439]},{"id":9859,"cover":{"id":118341,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co2jb9.jpg"},"name":"Theatre of War 3: Korea","platforms":[{"id":3,"name":"Linux"},{"id":6,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}],"screenshots":[{"id":102205,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/ttlp9iexqxvbdx44zwxr.jpg"},{"id":102206,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/dcqguiqc6sfrgmcpggnx.jpg"},{"id":102207,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/mokpxhjaq3za4suf6qhl.jpg"},{"id":102208,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/ltq3umoeonn6b0yjfq1y.jpg"},{"id":102209,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/ptjhauco2dysfjlzeegf.jpg"}],"summary":"Replay the events of the first hot war of the Cold War era, the Korean War, also known as the Forgotten War.

Molecats! \n \nMolecats are sort of cat-mole hybrids. They are simpletons who like mushrooms, marching and go on adventures! They usually dig into nearby caves to gather delicious ‘shrooms and shiny relics, but mostly get lost along the way. \n \nYour goal here is to guide Molecats through the caves by taking control of the environment and changing the course they follow. Along the way Molecats will face lots of dangerous traps, spooky monsters and tricky challenges and meet a whole bunch of strange but interesting creatures.","tags":[27,34,35,43,268435465,268435487,268435488],"videos":[{"id":9445,"video_id":"yfBeM2KLyIE"}]},{"id":10840,"cover":{"id":114948,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co2gp0.jpg"},"name":"Spy Fox In: Hold the Mustard","platforms":[{"id":3,"name":"Linux"},{"id":6,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"},{"id":14,"name":"Mac"}],"screenshots":[{"id":96094,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/gfuzkodlczrpysrfbdxi.jpg"},{"id":96095,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/wmonlxtcjq2tcnqjgab9.jpg"},{"id":96096,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/xoo161uqz36shdz3y5c6.jpg"},{"id":96097,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/l1rhcfj1v4d0dcpig7lv.jpg"},{"id":96098,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/gs2ewxdjcxogpdaciukc.jpg"}],"summary":"Climb aboard to help SPY Fox save the world's ketchup supply from the evil King Konglomerate!
