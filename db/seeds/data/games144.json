Meet PAMELA, an omnipresent AI overseer who is left alone watching over the once-vibrant city, now reduced to a silent monolith gliding across the ocean.

Uncover the tragic events that lead to the downfall of a civilization, and fight for your life as the broken citizens of Eden defend their home against your intrusion. With a personality-driven AI system, no encounter will be the same as the Afflicted react in unpredictable ways, driven by their excruciating pain and disfiguring disease. \n \nInteract with various Factions, including The Afflicted citizens, security Droids, robotic Custodians, and more mysterious denizens hidden within Eden's depths. Each faction exhibits its own unique behaviors and alliances, and will react dynamically to the player’s behavior to become allies, or enemies. Experience tense gameplay in a richly developed sci-fi universe. Each decision is meaningful, and each encounter could be your last. Wield and customize an array of Modular Equipment to defend yourself and explore the environment. Utilize an immersive UI and full body awareness, where the player's involvement is never broken. \n \nManage the power reserves of the city, using energy only when necessary to avoid the dangers of being stranded in the dark.

It features both the classic \"retro\" visuals of the original SWOS, as well as new improved high definition graphics, and retains the exact gameplay of the 96/97 version of Sensible World of Soccer. Due to problems with the game's network performance, the release was delayed in order for \"significant proportions\" of the network code to be rewritten. After missing several previous release dates, the game appeared on Xbox Live Arcade on 19 December 2007 but was quickly pulled. A statement from Microsoft confirmed that an incorrect version of the game had been made available, in which online play was not possible. The fixed version of the game was released two days later on 21 December.

It is also the final game of the Power of Chaos game series. The game includes 771 cards.\n\nThis game is featuring Joey Wheeler as the opponent, adds new cards, new dueling choices, new dueling options and more Decks for the opponent, making this the Power of Chaos game with the most content. The cards from the previous two Power of Chaos games, if installed, are included. New game features include a ranked difficulty for the computer opponent, denoted by a star gauge in the Duel menu, which ranks from 1 star to 9. As you win duels, the difficulty increases, and the opponent swaps his Deck for a more potent one every time this happens. Later difficulty levels (8-9) allow the opponent to use different Decks in that same level. Losing consecutive duels results in decreased difficulty for the first time in Power of Chaos games. Other options include allowing the opponent to use cards from the previous two games, increasing the difficulty. Also, the option to make many Limited cards Forbidden is given, making the game more balanced. One other new addition to the game is that when you win cards that you already have, you may have a choice of getting different cards, or keep the ones you've earned. This can only be done when every card you win in a match or one card in a single duel is a common card, not new. Last, you can also duel a friend via LAN or via Gameranger.","tags":[17,268435465,268435471,268435472,268435491,536870990,536871208,536871213,536871327,536874083,536874694,536875054,536875126,536875467,536875525,536875586,536876232,536877755]},{"id":150744,"cover":{"id":167986,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co3lma.jpg"},"name":"Archer Master","platforms":[{"id":6,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}],"screenshots":[{"id":477775,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sca8nj.jpg"},{"id":477778,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sca8nm.jpg"},{"id":477781,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sca8np.jpg"},{"id":477784,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sca8ns.jpg"},{"id":477788,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sca8nw.jpg"}],"summary":"A Tower Defense-Storytelling game about fighting against evil orc!","tags":[268435461,536870989]},{"id":50030,"name":"Fort Boyard","platforms":[{"id":22,"name":"Game Boy Color"}],"summary":"You will need courage, cunning and teamwork to beat the traps and pitfalls the Fort has in store and carry of its legendary treasure.","tags":[1,268435464]},{"id":80512,"cover":{"id":57578,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/p0mauexvcev1spfx4lxq.jpg"},"name":"Abyss","platforms":[{"id":41,"name":"Wii U"},{"id":130,"name":"Nintendo Switch"},{"id":159,"name":"Nintendo DSi"}],"screenshots":[{"id":180139,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/uhpuamdea60uqfxlnljt.jpg"},{"id":180140,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/locrsvh3obb5z1ko4lhx.jpg"},{"id":180141,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/vvavie1bwvsjl5jrfxrf.jpg"},{"id":180142,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/d71m9wwzguftvqhu3ile.jpg"},{"id":180143,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/hxfxri9ncg18pnzrsa3x.jpg"},{"id":180144,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/z6zz1s6o6t98id4rgoso.jpg"}],"summary":"Guide Nep2no through the depths to find new resources so humanity can survive.","tags":[1,18,40,268435469,268435487,268435488,536871945,536875046,536875629,536875842]},{"id":8236,"cover":{"id":138818,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co2z42.jpg"},"name":"Kinetica","platforms":[{"id":8,"name":"PlayStation 2"},{"id":48,"name":"PlayStation 4"}],"screenshots":[{"id":550086,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scbsg6.jpg"},{"id":550087,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scbsg7.jpg"},{"id":550088,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scbsg8.jpg"},{"id":550089,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scbsg9.jpg"}],"summary":"They're called kinetic suits.

The story unwinds in an unusual manner: At the start of the game, your character, Agent John Cord, has been captured by the enemy and is in the midst of a grueling interrogation. The scenes from the game come from his memories as he is undergoing this ordeal, with players taking on his previous adventures that lead him up to this point. It is a spy-thriller in the vein of James Bond, and as Cord remembers more, the overall story begins to make more sense.\n\nThroughout In Cold Blood, players will have to search for hidden objects and talk to a whole host of characters, attempting at every turn to solve the puzzles that pop up in their way. But tricky conundrums aren't the only thing blocking their paths -- they'll also have to take control of Agent Cord in high-octane gun battles against enemy agents.

The government alliance that had supported the building of ATLAS now find themselves facing economic crisis as the balance of power shifts. In this world of conflict and change, the Walking Panzer, or Wanzer, (a form of mecha) becomes the standard armored unit for wars and petty battles across the globe. For the small nation of Bergen, a coup d'etat is underway, staged by Colonel Ark. Seeking to establish complete control over the government and the NORAD units stationed there, Ark's first step involves the capture of President Orwen. Tipped off to the rebellion, Orwen seeks to flee from Bergen, looking for safe passage out of the seaport of Port Ertothal. A young Wanzer pilot, Albert Grabner, is assigned escort duty to the president by loyal elements of the army stationed there...\n\nGun Hazard is a side-scrolling shooter with strong RPG elements, and a spin-off of the Front Mission series. Gameplay is more than a little similar to Cybernator or Metal Warriors. The player moves between different stages on an area map. Once inside a stage, the player controls Albert and his wanzer as it moves left, right across the screen. The wanzer is able to jump, and attack with a primary and a special weapon. At any time during a stage, Albert can eject from his heavily armed wanzer to explore. Although vulnerable when outside, Albert is able to reach areas the wanzer cannot, in addition to being a smaller target and being able to jetpack indefinitely.\n\nMoney and experience are earned through the completion of mission objectives as well as the kill count of enemy wanzers. Additionally, Albert can recruit other characters through the normal course of the story, some of whom can be designated to support roles. These support characters when set can provide a variety of different cover fire abilities for Albert during his missions. They too gain experience and levels. Different weapons and armor can be found or bought. Essential components include the Booster ability which allows the wanzer to hover and increase its jumps, as well as the Dash ability which allows quick left-right movement by the wanzer.","tags":[1,18,268435461,268435464,536871075,536896177,536897818,536898541,536900657,536902076]},{"id":18870,"aggregated_rating":100.0,"cover":{"id":15215,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/iw71xlaf65eisaqkflna.jpg"},"name":"Championship Manager 4","platforms":[{"id":6,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"},{"id":14,"name":"Mac"}],"screenshots":[{"id":22747,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/fpkspijrjjgcnovw1yh1.jpg"}],"summary":"Championship Manager 4 series is a football-management simulation computer game.","tags":[268435469,268435470,268435471,536871906,536872060,536872078,536873715,536874694,536875433,536876660,536877432,536878090,536878109,536882395,536883266]},{"id":28825,"cover":{"id":141824,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co31fk.jpg"},"name":"Cosmo Police Galivan","platforms":[{"id":15,"name":"Commodore C64/128"},{"id":18,"name":"Nintendo Entertainment System (NES)"},{"id":25,"name":"Amstrad CPC"},{"id":26,"name":"ZX Spectrum"},{"id":48,"name":"PlayStation 4"},{"id":52,"name":"Arcade"},{"id":99,"name":"Family Computer"}],"summary":"Cosmo Police Galivan puts the player in control of a human being armed with a beam blade, which is only able to attack monsters in close proximity.

A prosperous kingdom has been overrun by demons, and now a sole hero controlled by the player must put an end to this invasion and restore peace in the realm.\n\nThe game uses a custom role-playing system which is based on a number of character attributes and skills the player can build. There are no character classes, and the player may develop fighting, thieving and magic skills based on their choice. Experience points are awarded for exploration, interaction with NPCs and successful combat encounters.\n\nThe setting is a vast fantasy world with several human kingdoms, also inhabited by various fantasy creatures, including dragons and other monsters, as well as different types of undead. However, humanoid fantasy races like elves or dwarves are not present. The state of human civilization is comparable to that of Ancient Rome, except for the widespread use of magic.","tags":[17,268435468,268435472]},{"id":12834,"cover":{"id":110766,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co2dgu.jpg"},"name":"Joe & Mac: Caveman Ninja","platforms":[{"id":13,"name":"PC DOS"},{"id":16,"name":"Amiga"},{"id":18,"name":"Nintendo Entertainment System (NES)"},{"id":19,"name":"Super Nintendo Entertainment System (SNES)"},{"id":29,"name":"Sega Mega Drive/Genesis"},{"id":33,"name":"Game Boy"},{"id":52,"name":"Arcade"},{"id":58,"name":"Super Famicom"},{"id":240,"name":"Zeebo"}],"screenshots":[{"id":16547,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/ljv599jkdhshrdid8t9w.jpg"},{"id":17711,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/ulcik7yr4x68ztnbnbkj.jpg"},{"id":618785,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scd9gh.jpg"}],"summary":"Back in the distant past (way back - like when “rock and roll” was just rock and fast food was dinner you couldn’t catch), lived two cave dudes named Joe and Mac.

The player has minor control over the character's movement as the focus is on moving the cursor used to snap pictures. It is possible to capture any part of the environment and pictures are lined up in the bottom right side of the screen. Correctly captured gags and unusual situations remain there, while the others fly away and are discarded. A score is built up based on the performance.","tags":[268435460],"videos":[{"id":55817,"video_id":"TwhglTKA0cs"}]},{"id":84292,"cover":{"id":219055,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co4p0v.jpg"},"name":"HoverRace","platforms":[{"id":6,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}],"screenshots":[{"id":728761,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scfmbd.jpg"},{"id":728763,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scfmbf.jpg"},{"id":728765,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scfmbh.jpg"},{"id":728767,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scfmbj.jpg"},{"id":728768,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scfmbk.jpg"}],"summary":"HoverRace is a racing video game created by GrokkSoft in 1996.","tags":[268435466]},{"id":19833,"aggregated_rating":49.0,"cover":{"id":168791,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co3m8n.jpg"},"name":"Flashback","platforms":[{"id":6,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"},{"id":9,"name":"PlayStation 3"},{"id":12,"name":"Xbox 360"}],"screenshots":[{"id":100279,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/rimxab0yknzvc9e1ttf4.jpg"},{"id":100280,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/emjnmwpljmscjblo9wyp.jpg"},{"id":100281,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/floey9uabglkg6xxgc05.jpg"},{"id":100282,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/rofwz4p1vngc0jmxfcth.jpg"},{"id":100283,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/l6noqnxfd6vtrbxslqno.jpg"}],"summary":"Flashback is a science fiction platform video game remake of the original 1992 Flashback.

It follows in the tradition of space war games such as Space Invaders and Galaga.\n\nGyruss was the second and last game Yoshiki Okamoto designed for Konami, after Time Pilot. Due to pay disputes, he was fired after the release of this game, and soon joined Capcom, where he would write 1942 and the first Street Fighter game.\n\nThe game's background music is an electronic, fast-paced arrangement of J. S. Bach's Toccata and Fugue in D minor, BWV 565; this particular arrangement is similar in sound to \"Toccata\", a rock arrangement by the UK-based instrumentalist group Sky.\n\nGyruss is notable for using stereo sound, which according to the bonus material for Konami Arcade Classics, was achieved by utilizing discrete audio circuits. The game used three microprocessors: two Z80 microprocessors and one 6809, as well as an 8039 microcontroller. For the sound, five AY-3-8910 PSG sound chips and a DAC.\n\nGyruss was released in both upright and cocktail cabinets.\n\nR.Hirst \"KOO\", M.Jones, \"BOX\" and the Elliott Brother's are arguably considered some of the best Gyruss players of the 1990's.","tags":[1,18,268435461,268435489,536871078,536871859,536871882,536872482,536875046,536875076,536875666,536875942,536876348,536876349,536876362,536876545,536877142,536880957],"videos":[{"id":27524,"video_id":"XhjB0ChfINs"}]},{"id":115555,"cover":{"id":164923,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co3j97.jpg"},"name":"Going Medieval","platforms":[{"id":6,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}],"screenshots":[{"id":290698,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc68ay.jpg"},{"id":290699,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc68az.jpg"},{"id":290700,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc68b0.jpg"},{"id":290701,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc68b1.jpg"},{"id":290702,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc68b2.jpg"}],"summary":"Guide a group of villagers to your heart's content in this realistic medieval colony sim.

The game was first released in North America on October 3, 2007, in Europe on October 12, 2007 and in Australia on October 25, 2007. It is the first game in the Crash Bandicoot series not to have a Japanese release.\n\nCrash of the Titans is the fourteenth installment in the Crash Bandicoot video game series and the sixth game in the main franchise, but it is the first in the Mutant series. The game's story centers on the discovery of a substance known as \"Mojo\", which the antagonist of the series, Doctor Neo Cortex, plans to use to turn the inhabitants of the Wumpa Islands into an army of loyal mutants known as \"Titans\". The protagonist of the series, Crash Bandicoot, must stop Cortex by using the technique of \"jacking\" to take control of and destroy Cortex's Titans while collecting the mojo.\n\nThe game received mixed reviews upon its release; critics disparaged the game's short length, and although the game's variety was generally seen positively, reviewers noted little outstanding in the game. Despite this mediocre reception, the game was nominated for two awards.","tags":[1,27,268435464,268435487,536871208,536871262,536871306,536871939,536872205,536872961,536872983,536874209,536875046,536875073,536875074,536875088,536875199,536875257,536875271,536875298,536875376,536875396,536875714,536875870,536876570,536876695,536876943,536877058,536877402,536877490,536877495,536879978,536880276,536881357,536882121,536883995,536887094,536887095,536887096,536887097,536887098,536887099,536887100,536887101,536887102,536887103]},{"id":10449,"cover":{"id":140958,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co30ri.jpg"},"name":"Gunforce","platforms":[{"id":19,"name":"Super Nintendo Entertainment System (SNES)"},{"id":52,"name":"Arcade"}],"screenshots":[{"id":551393,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scbtgh.jpg"},{"id":551394,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scbtgi.jpg"},{"id":551395,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scbtgj.jpg"}],"summary":"GunForce: Battle Fire Engulfed Terror Island or simply titled as GunForce, is a side-scrolling action shooting game produced by Irem for the arcades in 1991.

Initially beginning as a simple brand of Dragon Ball Z characters to go against the traditional Dragon Ball Z characters introduced into M.U.G.E.N. so far (overly flashy, broken, suffering heavily from Sturgeon's Law, etc.), the Z2 team of Balthazar (idea conceiver) and Cybaster (primary coder) expanded to include various others, including inspiring some other smaller projects in the team's honor. It's come to the point that a game based on the Z2 characters was realized, and the roster expanded from Goku and Vegeta to many more.","tags":[1,268435460,536872059,536873314,536873393,536874296,536874798,536888383,536896779],"videos":[{"id":39913,"video_id":"uZufZyJw59E"},{"id":39914,"video_id":"Wn1DgT6CQn0"},{"id":39915,"video_id":"FCnvM8ukoZk"},{"id":39916,"video_id":"OJXKSSt_dDw"},{"id":39917,"video_id":"KeBsfgWi-zw"},{"id":39918,"video_id":"udEmEgrhsgU"},{"id":39919,"video_id":"2bCBRzu3mkM"},{"id":39920,"video_id":"MiPudCVa2Oc"},{"id":39921,"video_id":"_lk4aYKw9Sw"}]},{"id":2669,"aggregated_rating":82.5,"cover":{"id":88972,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co1wng.jpg"},"name":"Guitar Hero World Tour","platforms":[{"id":5,"name":"Wii"},{"id":6,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"},{"id":8,"name":"PlayStation 2"},{"id":9,"name":"PlayStation 3"},{"id":12,"name":"Xbox 360"},{"id":14,"name":"Mac"}],"screenshots":[{"id":30676,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/hqbvcz3vrxbqnisu0ztv.jpg"},{"id":160712,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/ds3atp7wxnmjrmfuognz.jpg"},{"id":160713,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/qcws7uyso2dxtlahr0fk.jpg"},{"id":160714,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/qrvwr7esv21rjjw4edup.jpg"},{"id":160715,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/qplbsh3gc8ccelxdqvbz.jpg"},{"id":160716,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/qhrl9ippucwuiimecvhl.jpg"},{"id":160717,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/xyeqhjfdguldxgtslkki.jpg"},{"id":160718,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/kousvkau3ymagkuswd3k.jpg"},{"id":160719,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/surulrndlihh5qz0q45s.jpg"},{"id":160720,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/dybby1cskwjgsg96duep.jpg"},{"id":160721,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/jmemtt44hm8yukitcrob.jpg"},{"id":160722,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/tze1jhlr4rdiqphp8dvo.jpg"}],"summary":"Guitar Hero: World Tour is the fourth main game in the series and brings a major change to the concept. Following the release of Rock Band that built on the Guitar Hero concept but added additional instruments, World Tour introduces these as well to allow players to play together simultaneously as a real band. Next to the guitar that was the main peripheral for the previous titles, the bundled edition of the game adds a microphone for the vocal parts and drums for percussion. Just like the previous game, the guitar tracks are split up for the lead and bass. The lyrics and the vocal pitch is shown near the top of the screen, while the bottom part is split up for bass guitar, lead guitar and drums, each with a separate set of notes that need to be hit to correctly play the part.","tags":[268435463,536871213,536871400,536871577,536871627,536871669,536872064,536872098,536872205,536872245,536872964,536872983,536873064,536873065,536873455,536873847,536874136,536874398,536875049,536875122,536875123,536875157,536875184,536875185,536875245,536875257,536875265,536875271,536875312,536875322,536875364,536875456,536875486,536875610,536875611,536875735,536875751,536875766,536875781,536875822,536875941,536875943,536876055,536876100,536876101,536876102,536876199,536876266,536876348,536876435,536876464,536876498,536876566,536876617,536876639,536876699,536876703,536876762,536876799,536876817,536877026,536877035,536877108,536877187,536877275,536877490,536877664,536877953,536878071,536878193,536878222,536878239,536878281,536880245,536880266,536880316,536880848,536881010,536881263,536881598,536882368,536882369,536882370,536883103,536883461,536883593,536883777,536883779,536883813,536883988,536884389]},{"id":52192,"cover":{"id":114062,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co2g0e.jpg"},"name":"Shadow of the Colossus: Special Edition","platforms":[{"id":48,"name":"PlayStation 4"}],"screenshots":[{"id":398564,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc8jj8.jpg"},{"id":398565,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc8jj9.jpg"},{"id":398566,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc8jja.jpg"},{"id":398567,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc8jjb.jpg"},{"id":398568,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc8jjc.jpg"},{"id":398569,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc8jjd.jpg"},{"id":398570,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc8jje.jpg"},{"id":398571,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc8jjf.jpg"},{"id":398572,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc8jjg.jpg"},{"id":398573,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc8jjh.jpg"},{"id":398574,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc8jji.jpg"}],"summary":"The Special Edition release includes the following bonus items: \n- Steelbook Collector’s Case with outer sleeve \n- Artist Postcards \n- Printed Manual \n- In-game Digital Extras \n-- Ancient Bow \n-- Cloak of Fate \n-- “Spotted Steed” Agro skin \n- Two Custom PS4 Themes \n- Colossi Avatar Set for PS4 \n- Physical World Map \n- Colossi Stickers.","tags":[1,17,31,38,268435464,268435465,268435487,536871851,536871972,536883058,536888369,536888370,536896533,536896954,536896955],"videos":[{"id":40238,"video_id":"pdZQ98mWeto"},{"id":40239,"video_id":"RFgusTYInas"}]},{"id":189329,"cover":{"id":218834,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co4ouq.jpg"},"name":"Makai Kingdom: Reclaimed and Rebound","platforms":[{"id":6,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}],"screenshots":[{"id":724743,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scfj7r.jpg"},{"id":724744,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scfj7s.jpg"},{"id":724745,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scfj7t.jpg"},{"id":724746,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scfj7u.jpg"},{"id":724747,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scfj7v.jpg"},{"id":724748,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scfj7w.jpg"},{"id":724749,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scfj7x.jpg"},{"id":724750,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scfj7y.jpg"},{"id":724751,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scfj7z.jpg"},{"id":724752,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scfj80.jpg"},{"id":724753,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scfj81.jpg"},{"id":724754,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scfj82.jpg"},{"id":724755,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scfj83.jpg"},{"id":724756,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scfj84.jpg"}],"summary":"In Makai Kingdom: Reclaimed and Rebound, Lord Zetta, master of tactical warfare, aims to invade and reclaim the Netherworld—as a book!
