It is not directly related to the previous games in the series but it occurs in the same universe. The main characters' quest is to investigate mysterious \"windows\" from which vicious monsters pop out.\n\nGameplay follows that of its predecessors, using the Judgment Ring to decide most battle outcomes, as well as many other actions throughout the game. A new \"Stock\" system was made for this game which expands the combination attack system between party members from Shadow Hearts - Covenant and enables double attacks.\n\nThe \"Stock\" system works by filling up a character's stock gauge when he/she performs or receives an attack. A maximum of two stock gauge may be stored. Stock can then be utilized in many ways. For example, doing a Double attack (a character performs two action on the same turn) or starting a Combo consumes one Stock. A Double Combo on the other hand consumes two Stock. The Judgment Ring system essentially remains the same from Shadow Hearts: Covenant, with ring customization and added ring effect items being still available.\n\nMagic returns in the form of Stellar Charts, where characters equip Stellars onto the chart. The charts are based on the constellations of the twelve zodiac signs. Finding and fitting all the Stellars onto the charts rewards the player with the Melt Crest Stellar, the strongest non-elemental magic in the game.\n\nFusion is also back in the game, albeit quite differently. Unlike Yuri, Shania does not possess the power of the Harmonixer where she is able to fuse into different demons. She makes spirit pacts with the different Guardian Spirits and draws on their power to transform. Shania is only able to fuse into four forms but through acquiring fetishes; statues of different animals, she is able to learn different techniques by powering them up.\n\nSnapping photos is more emphasized in this game. Not only can Johnny obtain enemy data through his photographing enemies, he can also trade the snap cards obtained for prizes. Johnny can also draw upon the power of Malice to transform; though this ability comes rather late in the game.","tags":[17,22,268435468,536871123,536871139,536871148,536871183,536871400,536871758,536871938,536872098,536872112,536872201,536872225,536873096,536874398,536875055,536875067,536875196,536875241,536875271,536875314,536875331,536875358,536875380,536875420,536875455,536875523,536875525,536875621,536875639,536875763,536875822,536875831,536875855,536875870,536875896,536875952,536876054,536876232,536876285,536876847,536876855,536876940,536876974,536877373,536877453,536877554,536877560,536877988,536878005,536878078,536878308,536878335,536879212,536879586,536879859,536880051,536880755,536883080,536883154,536883158,536886711],"videos":[{"id":5222,"video_id":"4JUb947RRLI"}]},{"id":74620,"name":"NeoBoom2","platforms":[{"id":6,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}],"screenshots":[{"id":130816,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/samlbtdak9snc1cwksbt.jpg"},{"id":130817,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/bzl6asl4snfyqbojwdkz.jpg"},{"id":130818,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/fph55f8qhptkpakwayw2.jpg"},{"id":130819,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/apkw7qfpu6jj1kvyfje9.jpg"},{"id":130820,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/wg03ra0suoqqztifsuvf.jpg"}],"summary":"Your goal - to deliver the sphere of the right place.

Players will control a team of seven unique samurai against a massive single player experience or in online cooperative and competitive play modes.\n\nGuide your seven unique samurai as they seek to overthrow the evil that has overtaken the kingdom and avenge their slain Daimyo. From the gates of the clan citadel to the spire of the Dark Warlord's castle, you'll face more than 30 varieties of fantastic creatures from Japanese myth, including legions of undead warriors, fearsome demons, and giant dragons - all animated in breathtaking 16-bit color. Ten unique levels and dozens of side quests combine to create a truly original combat experience.\n\nThrone of Darkness introduces an innovative multi-character control interface that allows for the simultaneous command of up to four characters through a series of tactical \"plays,\" or formations. Each play is designed to combine the unique strengths of each samurai - such as the ranged attacks of the archer and the two-sword technique of the berserker - into a distinct tactical advantage. Play calling allows for a high level of control and coordination between the player and computer-controlled samurai never before seen in the genre.\n \nIn Throne of Darkness' multiplayer mode, up to 35 simultaneous players vie for the mantle of Dark Warlord in a king-of-the-hill style competition. Through competition and cooperation, four clans of seven samurai challenge the Dark Warlord, his seven lieutenants, and his countless minions, all of which can be controlled by a human player. Once the Dark Warlord is defeated, the conquering team becomes the new warlord.","tags":[1,17,22,31,268435468,268435471,268435487,536870973,536871063,536871076,536871165,536871208,536871422,536871938,536871939,536872131,536872581,536872939,536873370,536873591,536873822,536874688,536874694,536875257,536875320,536875361,536876758,536880130,536882285,536884030]},{"id":11183,"aggregated_rating":70.5714285714286,"cover":{"id":128552,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co2r6w.jpg"},"name":"Ronin","platforms":[{"id":3,"name":"Linux"},{"id":6,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"},{"id":14,"name":"Mac"},{"id":48,"name":"PlayStation 4"}],"screenshots":[{"id":16278,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/jahbg8efgbu89myxwaxi.jpg"},{"id":16279,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/hv1clprogbf8hh27jk41.jpg"},{"id":16280,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/ax0ic44l34vhlfprg4zs.jpg"},{"id":16281,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/pbrlgtenfqbzolomlmnp.jpg"},{"id":16282,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/emhd94yy3add3gtrcxho.jpg"}],"summary":"Ronin (stylized as RONIN) is a 2015 turn-based action platformer video game developed by Polish indie developer Tomasz Wacławek, designer at polish indie studio Flying Wild Hog, and published by Devolver Digital.

Because my parents are separated, my uncle, a somewhat strange man who runs a restaurant, has taken the role of being a father to me. Although it's hard work, I actually like helping out at the restaurant from time to time. \n \nOne day, while walking with Himeko, who I've been friends with since childhood, I was hit by a car and nearly died! Thanks to a miracle, I awoke to find myself in a hospital bed in America. After some bizarre adventures, I return to Japan and decide to move into my uncle's house where I can help him run his restaurant. \n \nImagine my surprise when several beautiful girls approach me to tell me how happy they are that we'll be working together. First, there's Himeko, who tells me she'll do anything for me, followed by Chizuru, a beautiful girl who lives in the neighborhood who wants to shower me with attention. Takano, a gorgeous girl from my class, also confesses her desire to do anything she can for me, as does Leo, the quiet girl who lives and works at the restaurant. At first I think they're just happy that I wasn't killed in the car accident, but gradually I realize that they've all fallen in love with me for some bizarre reason. The girls are spending every moment they can, taking care of me and giving me all their attention. \n \nAm I the luckiest guy in the world, or what?"},{"id":169628,"cover":{"id":178083,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co3ter.jpg"},"name":"WWR: World of Warfare Robots","platforms":[{"id":6,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}],"screenshots":[{"id":623018,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scdcq2.jpg"},{"id":623022,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scdcq6.jpg"},{"id":623026,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scdcqa.jpg"},{"id":623034,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scdcqi.jpg"},{"id":623037,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scdcql.jpg"},{"id":623039,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scdcqn.jpg"},{"id":623040,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scdcqo.jpg"},{"id":623041,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scdcqp.jpg"},{"id":623042,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scdcqq.jpg"},{"id":623043,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scdcqr.jpg"},{"id":623044,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scdcqs.jpg"}],"summary":"Join robot war games.

Its success caused Dynamix to create a very similar follow-up Aces Over Europe in 1993.","tags":[22,39,268435469,536870931,536870948,536871904,536872060,536872129,536875137,536876104,536880716,536881275,536883625,536883952]},{"id":5397,"cover":{"id":111068,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co2dp8.jpg"},"name":"The Lawnmower Man","platforms":[{"id":6,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"},{"id":19,"name":"Super Nintendo Entertainment System (SNES)"},{"id":29,"name":"Sega Mega Drive/Genesis"},{"id":33,"name":"Game Boy"},{"id":78,"name":"Sega CD"}],"screenshots":[{"id":333077,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc7505.jpg"},{"id":333078,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc7506.jpg"},{"id":333079,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc7507.jpg"}],"summary":"The Lawnmower Man is the game based on the 1992 movie of the same name (itself loosely based on a Stephen King short story) starring pre-Bond fame Pierce Brosnan as Dr. Lawrence Angelo, a scientist working for Virtual Space Industries in \"Project 5\", a secret research that attempts to increase the intelligence of primates using psychotropic drugs and VR training.\n\nWith his reluctance to aim the research to military purpose, after one of the chimps escapes and shoots a guard in the process he is given a forced vacation, and while taking notes on the need for experiment with a human subject, he notices Jobe Smith (Jeff Fahey), a simpleton who makes his living on odd jobs such as mowing the grass (hence, the title role). The first experiments quickly increase Jobe's intelligence, and while after an accident Angelo stopped the experiments, The Shop, a secret agency overviewing Project 5, reinserted the drugs responsible for violent behaviour into the program and sped up the treatment. As Jobe starts to develop telekinetic powers, he starts to take revenge on those who abused him before he started the treatments, and plots to take over all computers in the world.\n\nWhile the CD version of the game (PC, Mega CD) is an interactive movie, both cartridge versions are platformers, the player taking control of Dr. Angelo or Carla Parkette (mother of Jobe's best friend) in typical side-scrolling shooting action. The player can collect better weapons or data discs, which after collecting a number of them allow to morph into the Virtual Suit, which gives protection against a first hit. The player visits several locations seen in the movie, such as the gas pump and the VSI headquarters.\n\nThe twists of the game are true-3D level connectors, based on the CG sequences of the movie, usually all involving avoiding obstacles (and the occasional shooting) at high speed in the VR world. There are four different (Virtual World, Cyber War, Cyber Run and Cyber Tube), each taking a slightly different approach (Virtual World is seen in first person, the objective being dodging obstacles such as trees and archs and reach the exit, Cyber War similar to Virtual World but with some shooting stops, Cyber Run is seen in third person and requires occasional shooting of obstacles, while Cyber Tube is a fast travel with plenty of enemies in a VR tunnel).","tags":[1,268435489]},{"id":171621,"cover":{"id":179611,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co3ul7.jpg"},"name":"Panmorphia: Enchanted","platforms":[{"id":130,"name":"Nintendo Switch"}],"screenshots":[{"id":636563,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scdn6b.jpg"},{"id":636570,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scdn6i.jpg"},{"id":636574,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scdn6m.jpg"},{"id":636579,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scdn6r.jpg"},{"id":636581,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scdn6t.jpg"},{"id":636585,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scdn6x.jpg"},{"id":636588,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scdn70.jpg"},{"id":636591,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scdn73.jpg"},{"id":636592,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scdn74.jpg"}],"summary":"A room escape game set in the magical world of Panmorphia.

The game supports single player and same screen multiplayer modes.\n\nThe game received average and favourable reviews on both platforms, being described as generally enjoyable or fun, but let down by a short campaign, lack of online multiplayer, and a limited appeal to non Warhammer:40,000 fans.","tags":[1,18,268435461,268435481,268435489,536871008,536871859,536871882,536871938,536871945,536872205,536872272,536872535,536874916,536875046,536875063,536875157,536875195,536875257,536875610,536876309,536876435,536877034,536878202,536878281,536880863,536881261,536882900,536882901,536882902,536882903,536882904,536889479,536892533,536892534],"videos":[{"id":2514,"video_id":"W9n4aGILHos"}]},{"id":96545,"cover":{"id":125750,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co2p12.jpg"},"name":"Europa 1400: The Guild - Expansion Pack","platforms":[{"id":6,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}],"screenshots":[{"id":419765,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc8zw5.jpg"},{"id":419766,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc8zw6.jpg"},{"id":419767,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc8zw7.jpg"},{"id":419768,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc8zw8.jpg"},{"id":419769,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc8zw9.jpg"}],"summary":"The official expansion to the acclaimed simulation of life in the middle ages: Europe 1400 - The Guild. \n \nThree new occupations - roam the streets as a travelling entertainer, manage graves and tombs as a churchyard warden or manufacture tunics as a tailor. \nThree new titles, five new offices and many privileges expand your sphere of influence. \nThree new levels and three new locations, such as the cannon tower, await you in your new \"dwelling\". \nNuremberg, the Emperor's town - almost three times larger than all previous towns. \nImpressive artefacts and arcane séances are at your disposal. \nCompletely done-over graphics and character animations. \nAlmost double as many sound recordings and extended movie sequences."},{"id":143593,"cover":{"id":131456,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co2tfk.jpg"},"name":"Silence Channel","platforms":[{"id":6,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}],"screenshots":[{"id":422642,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc9242.jpg"},{"id":422643,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc9243.jpg"},{"id":422644,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc9244.jpg"},{"id":422645,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc9245.jpg"},{"id":422646,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc9246.jpg"},{"id":422647,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc9247.jpg"},{"id":422648,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc9248.jpg"}],"summary":"A bad incident is like a tangled knot, It sits there, waiting for someone or something to untie it, but until then… scars may be left behind …","tags":[19,21,43,268435461,268435487,268435488,536871040,536871135,536872220,536872541,536873336],"videos":[{"id":45735,"video_id":"iewZfNx3lCQ"}]},{"id":142404,"cover":{"id":132290,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co2u2q.jpg"},"name":"Yoshi vs. Windows Platinum","platforms":[{"id":6,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}],"screenshots":[{"id":417705,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc8yax.jpg"},{"id":417706,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc8yay.jpg"},{"id":417707,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc8yaz.jpg"}],"summary":"Yoshi vs. Windows Platinum is a remake of the Yoshi VS Windows.

Bubbles can be picked up and dropped by the player's \"clown\" at the bottom, and are destroyed when three or more of the same color are put together on a single column. \"Chains\" are formed either when a single drop caused a chain reaction, or when more than one group of bubbles is destroyed in quick succession. The game is normally played with two players (one may be a computer opponent), and chains cause the opponent's stack to descend faster.\n\nThere are 24 characters, all but the Black Pierrot being named after a tarot card (although the Strength card has been represented by two characters throughout the series). Different characters have different attack patterns. The columns of the opponent's stack will descend at different rates relative to each other depending on the character chosen. This causes a disjunction of colors that may make it more difficult for the other player to clear their stack. For example, with the character Devil, all the columns will descend at the same rate, whereas with Sun, the middle columns will descend faster than the others.","tags":[17,268435465,268435489,536870990,536871257,536871308,536874896,536879162,536894323,536897818],"videos":[{"id":23854,"video_id":"ugYjWbCOucE"},{"id":54804,"video_id":"W0f1uiunMA8"}]},{"id":10723,"cover":{"id":134373,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co2vol.jpg"},"name":"Professional Farmer 2014","platforms":[{"id":6,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}],"screenshots":[{"id":99325,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/j9l04qbpu6aorcnrkwp7.jpg"},{"id":99326,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/x6fqckjyvoajcalwmloh.jpg"},{"id":99327,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/prkaz5m996sf84stbp59.jpg"},{"id":99328,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/pfkb5eir1wgdsg12lkau.jpg"},{"id":99329,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sxslph8ea66vro6bjrnz.jpg"}],"summary":"The PC simulator \"Professional Farmer 2014\" takes the player to the countryside and gives hobby farmers full control in the comfort of their home. Farm management, cultivating fields, planting crops, animal husbandry and buying and selling produce are just a few of the major game elements this simulator offers.\n\nStarting out with a small estate, the player begins their career as an up-and-coming farmer and little by little acquires new fields, tractors, machines and animals, and can either specialize or make use of all options that farming has to offer. The key to success lies in good planning by season, expert knowledge that you acquire throughout the game, and skill and good old-fashioned hard work. As a farmer, the player learns to live with the forces of nature, accept the weather and respond so as to perfect the yield from fields, care for the animals and prepare the budget for new investments. Many tractors and farm machines (combine harvesters, field choppers, attaching parts and trailers, etc.) by renowned manufacturers are available to cultivate the farm and manage all the work. Only good planning and hard work will turn fallow earth into a flourishing and fertile soil. Of course, you can drive and control all machines yourself, be it hooking up the plough, re-filling the tractor or unloading the harvest.\n\n\"Professional Farmer 2014\" has a broad variety of crops, depending on the environment and climate, with which the farmer can cultivate the fields diversely, effectively and with a high yield. Even crop rotation plays an important role in planning! The integrated seasons influence the game and provide the player with a constant stream of tasks and jobs.\n\nThe local farmers market is your first stepping-stone to success! After just a short time, you should take our home grown and harvested produce to the market and earn your first money by selling it. As you sell more, you will soon see more and larger machines in your fleet and be able to grow larger quantities of produce. Gradually, you will even be able to construct new buildings and acquire new fields.","tags":[268435469,536871906,536872060]},{"id":137717,"cover":{"id":113478,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co2fk6.jpg"},"name":"LEGO Marvel's Avengers: All-New, All-Different Doctor Strange Pack","platforms":[{"id":6,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"},{"id":9,"name":"PlayStation 3"},{"id":12,"name":"Xbox 360"},{"id":41,"name":"Wii U"},{"id":48,"name":"PlayStation 4"},{"id":49,"name":"Xbox One"}],"summary":"Based on the All-New, All-Different Doctor Strange comics, this DLC adds a brand-new level and eight characters to your LEGO Marvel's Avengers journey!"},{"id":11680,"cover":{"id":11023,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/mcqw7s6gbe1hvya2dppe.jpg"},"name":"H.U.R.L.","platforms":[{"id":13,"name":"PC DOS"}],"screenshots":[{"id":11822,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/ibgomd7wfnrc1mhrywiq.jpg"},{"id":11823,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/zheb3myz3m9uqvyrru5u.jpg"},{"id":11824,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/c2luca3vnhc0oiiiodsu.jpg"},{"id":11825,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/lmttttx7atrfaw8uuj9r.jpg"}],"summary":"H.U.R.L. is a nonviolent video game aimed at children that was released in 1995 by a publishing house called Deep River Publishing. It is a first-person shooter (FPS), and is part of the wave of nonviolent FPSes that followed closely on the release of Doom and other games such as Wolfenstein 3D in the early 90s. It was later re-released as Slob Zone 3D, and then translated to German and released as Blob Schlammschlacht 3D (\"Blob Mudfight 3D\").\n\nThe game takes place in an area called The Slob Zone which is under the control of Bob the Slob, who controls the Hardcore Union of Radical Litterbugs, a legion of oversized creatures such as frogs and cats who give the game its name. The game provides a storyline stating that Bob the Slob has stolen the world's supply of clean underwear and it is up to the player to get it back. The player finds himself navigating through various neighborhoods from which the human population seems to have been chased out, and which are now occupied by the aforementioned sloppy animals, most of whom are armed with trash and ready to dump it on any player attempting to break in and clean up. The hero's role involves not only staying clean while navigating through the game's ten increasingly messy levels, but also cleaning up after the animals, who have dirtied the landscape with waste items such as banana peels, empty soda bottles, and apple cores. As the player gathers up this rubbish, he will be on the lookout for vending machines where it can be dropped off and traded for weapons: soap, water balloons, and deodorant, which he can use to fight back against the animals as they hurl their trash at him. If an animal is hit too many times, it will stop attacking and usually allow the player to pass. If the player is hit too many times, the screen displays the message \"YOU'VE BEEN SLOBBED!\" and the level starts over again with all the trash and animals respawned, and no weapons or trash in the hands of the player. However, the game can be saved at any point, and restoring a saved game will also restore the weapons and money the player had when it was saved.\n\nLacking violence, the game uses graphical surrealism and potty humor to keep its young audience interested. The player must search each level for bathrooms in the hopes of finding a clean toilet to use to clean himself up after being hit in the face with dirty things such as kitty litter. In the final level the player sneaks into a nightclub and then into a house with no bathroom, and meets the game's only boss, whose weapon of choice is his own dirty diapers and who emits a brief fart-like sound when hit. In order that the game be able to earn an RSAC rating suitable for children, no graphic depictions of anything obscene are included.\n\nThe artificial intelligence of the enemies has been criticized for being of sub-standard quality. Some animals disobey the apparent rules of surrender in that they will not let the player pass by even after being defeated (this is sometimes known as solid corpses in more violent games), and one game reviewer noted his frustration with being unable to complete a level simply because an animal was blocking his passage through a door.","tags":[1,27,35,268435461,268435487,536871065,536871262,536871325,536871599,536871937,536871939,536872010,536872027,536872474,536872627,536874706,536875079,536875098,536875199,536875216,536875242,536875288,536875330,536875493,536875511,536875524,536875639,536875650,536875690,536875923,536876098,536876179,536879025,536879027,536882381],"videos":[{"id":5076,"video_id":"2umEsAtXzok"}]},{"id":16724,"cover":{"id":184471,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co3yc7.jpg"},"name":"Rebuild 3: Gangs of Deadsville","platforms":[{"id":6,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"},{"id":14,"name":"Mac"},{"id":39,"name":"iOS"}],"screenshots":[{"id":99435,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/ywr4em1qv6lgcbnokecj.jpg"},{"id":99436,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/x1qqaxi2vgjlchrv2ing.jpg"},{"id":99437,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/lbwyta97xbouyvlgagkz.jpg"},{"id":99438,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/zvk0cu1hk1c8sar6zosp.jpg"},{"id":99439,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/wefjkr0eq4rjcqmzh5dn.jpg"}],"summary":"Rebuild 3 is a strategy sim game with a good helping of narrative and dark humor.

It was inspired by an early 1980s game called Hustle from the Radio Shack TRS-80 micro-computer. (It was not influenced by Mozaik Software's 1984 Amstrad CPC game, Nibbler, despite the similar names.) Nibbles was written in QBasic by Rick Raddatz, who later went on to create small business companies such as Xiosoft and Bizpad.\n\nThe game's objective is to navigate a virtual snake (or worm) through a walled-space while consuming numbers (from 1 through 9) along the way. The player must avoid colliding with walls, other snakes or their own snake. Since the length of the snake increases with each number consumed, the game increases in difficulty over time. After the last number has been eaten, the player progresses to the next level, with more complex obstacles and increased speed. There is a multiplayer mode which allows a second player to control a second snake by using a different set of keys on the same keyboard.\n\nNibbles originally became popular because it was included with MS-DOS version 5.0 and above. Written in QBasic, it is one of the programs included as a demonstration of that programming language. The QBasic game uses the standard 80x25 text screen to emulate an 80x50 grid by making clever use of foreground and background colors, and the ANSI characters for full blocks and half-height blocks. Microsoft's 24kB QBasic version was copyrighted in 1990. Because of MS-DOS's prevalence at that time, it was available on almost every PC in the early 1990s. Modern computer speeds have rendered the game-speed-delay timing loops invalid, and thus the QBasic version of Nibbles requires some code changes to operate correctly on modern PCs. However, the adjustable clock rate on the DOSBox DOS emulator allows the original code to run at speeds similar to those on the original hardware. Nibbles is also runnable on QB64 as a way to avoid emulation.","tags":[1,268435489,536872667,536872668,536872669,536872670,536872671],"videos":[{"id":5142,"video_id":"UmeKHtei0qo"}]},{"id":150095,"cover":{"id":157380,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co3dfo.jpg"},"name":"Eyes of the Killer","platforms":[{"id":3,"name":"Linux"},{"id":6,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"},{"id":14,"name":"Mac"}],"summary":"The residents of the city are drafted one by one into a new play.

It also added real-time space shooter elements to the game, which allowed for an interesting combination with the turn-based mode already featured in the ground-based. Jump to Lightspeed also added many space missions and four space-specific professions. Two races were also added: Sullustan and Ithorian. \n \nThe expansion added space combat. Characters could choose one of three factions in the new Pilot sub-profession: Rebel, Imperial, or Freelance. The playable sectors include the space surrounding the ten planets of the game as well as Kessel and \"Deep Space.\" Combat is real-time and twitch-oriented like a first-person shooter and can be played with a joystick at the player's option. A new Artisan profession, Shipwright, was also introduced. This profession created ships, shields, armor, weapons, etc for players.
