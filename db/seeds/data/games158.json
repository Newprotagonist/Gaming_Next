Most of the rules of play and monster-raising conventions established in earlier games remain in this version. Monsters develop according to the training and treatment they receive and players are encouraged to explore the game world to find new training opportunities. Players can generate monsters using other forms of media, as the game creates creatures according to data on music CDs and movie DVDs. While some aspects of creation are random, certain albums and movies may generate creatures specifically related to the artistic content on the disk.",

You control Zeus (Boss of Olympus) which is a wacky character. He tries to fix a time machine to save the planet from explosion. Everything happens in Greek mythology timeframe. The characters and dialogues are silly and translated into 6 languages. There is English Voice over in some cut scenes. We use Vector art, a unique cartoonish style. Zeus, the boss of Olympus is summoned back to earth by an ancient security mechanism. The story starts with Zeus flying his spaceship and landing it in the bottom of the Santorini Ocean. In Santorini he will interact with dozens of crazy characters and solve many smart puzzles. The game is big, full length. He will visit Oia, Akrotiri, Fira, Caldera, Volcano and many more places until he finally discovers his super weapon, the thunder and the time machine box. But even then the task is far from over, he will have to set sail to another cluster of Greek islands, Milos, Karpathos, Mykonos and Delos. There he has to find the scattered pieces of the time machine so that he can use it to save the planet. There he will even abduct Europe transformed into a bull (mythology) and take her to Minoan Crete in the Knossos timeframe. There he will enter the famous labyrinth of Knossos, go to Festos and find the missing pieces to complete the mission.",

The highest priority now was to carryout research into new energy sources, preservation of the enviro- ment and maintenance of the cultural heritage. However, at the dawn of the 21st century, provision of considerable funds from an unknown source released by the politicians of the new, unified government, permitted a return to the space research programme.\n\nThe conquest began gradually with the construction of huge, manned artificial satellites. Several lunar bases were created with the view to becoming future Earth colonies within the solar system. The considerable advancements made together with the supply of increasingly greater sums of money allowed man to explore, even as far as the planet Titan.\n\nYou play the part of Conrad Hart, controlling his every move through the 6 levels of the game.

    "summary": "The second game in the The Chikyuu Boueigun series, renamed Global Defence Force for its English release (similarly the first game was renamed Monster Attack for its English release).\n\nIt\u0027s been two years since the invading alien menace was defeated by the Global Defence Force (the game renames the \"Earth Defence Force\" from the previous game), but like any good off-world threat, they\u0027re back for more, and they\u0027ve brought new weapons and technology in their attempts to take Earth and eliminate humanity. Thankfully, the GDF has also been developing new technology to fight them.\n\nGlobal Defence Force is a third-person action shooter. Choose from either an GDF infantryman or the flight-capable Pale Wing, each with different abilities and dozens of weapons each, and set out to shoot down hordes of giant insects, enormous robots, and UFOs of incredible scale. You can choose two weapons to carry for each mission, and pickups dropped by enemies will unlock new weapons and increase your character\u0027s maximum health. You can play the game split-screen cooperatively.\n\nBeyond adding a second player class to choose from; the Pale Wing; a fragile but powerful melee centric character with a limited Jetpack and her own weapon set, to go alongside the infantry man of the first game, Global Defence Force doesn\u0027t change much of the basic game play of Monster Attack. But leaving at that would undersell the game; there are numerous new alien types, weapons and environments that add much more variety to things. The maps are larger and more detailed and missions are longer and much more scripted (where as the original game nearly always threw you into an environment against some preplaced bug\u0027s, this time you often have some simple objective(s)) to add further variety. Finally the physics have been notably enhanced.\n\nLike Monster Attack, the player in Global Defence Force fights completely by themselves despite being part of an army (unless playing offline only 2 player split screen); the original Japanese version features radio chatter from other GDF squads and your commanding officer, to give the illusion that you are fighting alongside others. This was cut from the English release."

Your tower can have Libraries (store spells), Crystals (generate mana), Dwarf Dwellings (give you dwarves to repair the tower) and some other rooms. The crucial room is Archmage\u0027s Chamber. It\u0027s position is hidden from enemy and you must protect it at all costs, or you will lose. Room scheme is very important: the higher you place it, the more powerful it gets. Higher tower gets tremendous advantage over the lower one. But beware of Lightning strike! It can start a fire that will destroy the whole tower in several turns, so keep Dwarf Firefighters ready. Some rooms work much better underground, but there is a risk of flood! The overall goal of the game match is to destroy the enemy\u0027s Archmage\u0027s Chambers by crushing, burning or flooding it. It\u0027s not that simple however, because enemy will do his best to destroy your Archmage at the same time!",

There are several, engaging mechanics to look out for and many new friends to meet along the way. \n   In every level (unless you are playing through the Hard-core mode), you will start out with three health points represented through Apples in the top-left corner of the screen. Once the level has been completed, those Apples will regenerate. If you are in the middle of an encounter with a boss, however, your apples will not regenerate until the encounter has come to an end. Throughout the game, your character is surrounded by a box. As objects approach you, you must dodge and come up with cunning ways to avoid projectiles in short amounts of time. In some rooms, the dimensions of the box will distort, creating more complex layouts and levels simultaneously. \n   If you know the game front to back, it should only take around 40-60 minutes. However, for a new player, it will likely take 4-5 hours. Of course, Adventure mode isn\u0027t the only thing to do, nor will a second play-through seem stale immediately. Once adventure mode is completed, it is suggested to complete your collection, and fight the secret/final boss. \n   The game auto-saves upon entering a new area, and the room before a boss. Text will appear in the bottom-right corner to notify the player that it is currently auto-saving.",

He takes her to his home world to show her the injustices done to his people and the two eventually fall in love. During this time, a cybrid assassin named Mercury is hired by an unknown contractor to eliminate Daniel, but the contract is canceled moments before the shot is fired. Eventually, Victoria and Daniel try to make amends between the Imperials and the Phoenix, but it all ends disastrously when the Phoenix\u0027s enemies, the Blood Eagle tribe, stage a raid on a Phoenix base disguised as Imperial troops. In rage, Daniel kills the Imperial King, Tiberius, whom Victoria avenges by killing Daniel.

This game also marks the first appearance in a video game by the characters in RUGRATS: ALL GROWN UP. The characters from the popular television shows and evildoers work to move through a number of cartoon settings in order to solve different puzzles in this unique venture. Nicktoons characters are surfacing in places that they don\u0027t belong and confusion has followed. Jimmy Neutron, the boy genius has used his advanced intellect to come up with a plan to work through this strange situation. Jimmy has enlisted the help of his fellow Nicktoon friends to get to the bottom of the strange occurrences. The object of the game is to take a picture of each lost character and send them back to their corresponding show. Choose from 8 different Nicktoon characters to search through different shows like HEY ARNOLD, SPONGEBOB SQUAREPANTS, THE FAIRLY ODDPARENTS, AND WILD THORNBERRIES. The game begins with THE FAIRLY ODDPARENTS and progresses to the other show as the player unlocks the levels. Photographers are sent out into each show and the vertical scrolling adventure begins with characters moving onto the screen. New characters can be unlocked with enough points accumulated by taking photos. Fans of Nicktoons and any of the characters featured in this game are in for the most unique treat watching different characters interact in atypical surroundings.",

Many of the developers from the original game are actively working on the reboot.\n\nThe new Amplitude will be treated like a classic, sci-fi concept album. There is a narrative that runs through the game and surfaces in many ways through the visuals, music and song lyrics. \n\nPlayers will speed down long, winding paths made up of the different musical elements of a song. Each track is differentiated with the musical sounds of synthesizers, drums, vocals, and bass. As players blast away the patterns of gems on these tracks, they release musical energy and recreate the hidden song within.\n\nGameplay remains easy to pick up and difficult to master. Achieving a top score will be a challenge and therefore worth bragging about via online leaderboards.\n\nAmplitude supports up to four players locally. Challenge your friends and use devastating power-ups during frenetic multiplayer matches to secure your place at the top.",

Orcs have become victims of brutal Human expansion, as they are carelessly poisoning the environment. Now, four trained Orc heroes are retaliating with a Not-So-Silent yet very deadly plan. In either single-player or up to four-player co-op, you will take on the role of Orcs, each wielding a unique gaseous ability, and then take the fight to the Humans in a stinky, fart-filled romp. Hilarious enemies and highly tuned combat make for a joyous experience that really is worth sharing. While the comedic storyline and the striking 3D world make it even more memorable. Gross but charming protagonists add the final flourish with flatulent group attacks and nasty killer moves for up to four players.",

    "summary": "Burnout Dominator is an installment of the Burnout series for the PlayStation 2 and the PlayStation Portable systems. The game is mainly focused on returned Burnouts feature - draining a complete boost meter without stopping wich was last seen in Burnout 2: Point of Impact. With return of Burnouts feature there were four new game modes added including Maniac Mode (players need to drive dangerously to get highest scores by earning drifts, air, oncoming and near misses. Chaining Burnouts in this mode increases the score multiplier), Drift Challenge (in this mode player need to obtain as many feet of drifting as possible. Chaining Burnouts also increases the score multiplier here), Near Miss Challenge (same as Drift Challenge, but player needs to score near miss bonuses), Burnout Challenge (also same as Drift Challenge, but focusing on obtaining Burnouts score). However, some options have been removed from the game - for instance Burnout Dominator doesn\u0027t feature Crash Mode, there is also no Traffic Checking Mode and Online Multiplayer. But PSP version features Burnout HQ where you can upload you score and download new track. The game consists of 12 different tracks, in 8 different real world locations. Each track has a forward and a reverse configuration.",

    "summary": "Based on Rare\u0027s off-beat mascot, It\u0027s Mr. Pants is a traditional puzzle game in the Tetris sense where the challenge is to piece together specific shapes of specific colors on a flat playing field grid. The idea is simple: form rectangles of larger than 3x2 to make them disappear from play. The pieces can be rotated in 90 degree variations, important to get these tiles into the littlest slots on the field. You can\u0027t place same colors on top of each other, but you can place other colors on top of already placed shapes to remove them from play. There are three variations: in \"Puzzle,\" the challenge is to remove all shapes from play with the set amount of pieces. In \"Wipeout\", you\u0027ve got two minutes to remove all shapes from play with an infinite amount of pieces. And in \"Marathon,\" the challenge is to constantly place and remove shapes as long as you can, trying to keep the session alive as the playfield gets eaten away from the outside in.",

    "summary": "Corn Buster is a Super Nintendo game developed by Engine Software. The game is the story of a dragon named Globey, who sets out to defeat the person who’s stolen all the cornflakes in the world. The gameplay is an interesting mix of an Arkanoid-Style ball-and-paddle game and a vertical scrolling shooter. The game quietly began development around 1994, and was canceled soon after interest in the Super Nintendo waned in light of the release of Sony’s Playstation. Some time ago, Engine Software released a ROM of the game for free download on their website. The download page has since been removed, but the ROM is still easily obtainable. The game was 70-80% completed before it was canceled.\n\nThe game was finally released in 2015 by Piko Interactive.",

    "summary": "I Wanna Be the Guy: The Movie: The Game is a 2D platform indie freeware video game created by independent developer Michael \"Kayin\" O\u0027Reilly for Microsoft Windows using Multimedia Fusion 2. First released in October 2007, the game is not in active development despite being listed as a beta, though the source code for the game was released by Kayin in November 2011. \n \nIWBTG is most famous for its difficulty. Most of the landscape is engineered specifically to kill the player character. Alongside a traditional range of recognizable dangers, such as spikes and pits, there are many less obvious threats as well, most of which are all but impossible to avoid without either previous knowledge or trial and error.",

    "summary": "Killzone 3 is the fourth game in the Killzone franchise. Several improvements have been made over its prequel, and it can be seen in overall smoother and more balanced gameplay. As in previous game, you will commandeer various turrets and vehicles which will add to firepower but will leave you with rails-driven gameplay. One of the new weapons is a jet-pack which lets you jump and semi-fly with unlimited ammo as a part of new exoskeleton. The environment can sometimes be destroyed or used to your advantage, shooting barrels or certain plants will take out nearby enemy soldiers. Beside single-player campaign, Killzone 3 offers an upgraded version of Killzone 2\u0027s multiplayer. The game is also the first in the franchise to support 3D TVs.",

    "summary": "Action Doom is a total conversion that attempts to simulate 2D sidescroller shoot-em-up gameplay in Doom\u0027s first person perspective. The project was spearheaded by Stephen \"Scuba Steve\" Browning with additional help from Mike \"Cyb\" Watson, Julian Aubourg, and Kara \"Nanami\" Rader. The author of Action Doom dedicated a significant portion of time to creating blogged \"advertisements\" and held contests for various events to give away prizes that related to Action Doom.\n\nThe purpose of Action Doom was to not only create a modification for Doom, but to invent and market an imaginary product with the intent of simulating the environment surrounding the golden era of gaming of the early 90s. Coupled with the hopes of invigorating the stagnant Doom community, the author tried to generate as much hype and interest while showing almost no preliminary screenshots or information, leaving those items up to the community\u0027s imagination.",

    "summary": "Cannon Fodder is an action-strategy shoot \u0027em up game developed by Sensible Software and published by Virgin Interactive. The game is military-themed and based on shooting action but with a strategy game-style control system. The player directs troops through numerous missions, battling enemy infantry, vehicles and installations.\n\nCannon Fodder has a darkly humorous tone which commentators variously praised and condemned. Its creators intended it to convey an anti-war message, which some reviewers recognised, but the Daily Star and a number of public figures derided the game. In other respects, reviewers highly praised the game, which widely achieved scores of over 90% in Amiga magazines. Amiga Action awarded it an unprecedented score, calling it the best game of the year.",

    "summary": "Vampire Killer is a side-view flick-screen game where you are a Vampire hunter who has been tasked to remove Dracula from the 12th floor of a block of flats by a client on the floor below. The problem is, as well as facing and killing a vampire, the job has to be completed before midnight which is only eight minutes away. In your rush to get to the building you have forgotten your equipment like garlic and stakes, which is needed to face Dracula. You have to get to the 12th floor using elevators (which have minds of their own and can take you down as well as up), and you must look behind the doors of each flat for equipment to help you.\n\nSome flats are also empty as well as flats that have scares inside you and when scared, you lose part of a shock meter and when it reaches zero then it is game over. Bats and spiders live on various floors with some blocking your route so bullets can be found in the flats to clear the way. Some doors to the flats actually are lift shafts which send you back down to the 1st floor. Before you play the game you can select your skill level from easy, medium and hard.",

    "summary": "This mod builds on the PSX DOOM Total Conversion and DOOM 64 Retribution, to take advantage of the latest GZDoom versions and adds many features that make them more faithful but were impossible to implement at their time of release. To achieve this, a large amount of the code has been adapted from GEC Master Edition (also known as DZDoom) into ZScript, while looking at the reverse engineered source code and existing source ports of these games for reference.\n\nIn addition to that, the mod is highly modular and also incluides many optional \"enhancements\" that deviate from the original experience. Depending on your taste you can opt for going as close to vanilla as possible, or experiment and play with upscaled textures, PBR materials, flashy particle effects and other features that are common in other GZDoom \"enhacement\" mods.",

Regardless of the mode chosen, once in the air the player will have control over speed, direction, altitude, gun cannon, missiles and special weapon of their aircraft. A new feature from previous Ace Combat games, is the concept of Wingmen and being able to issue simple orders to them in the air. This allows the player to better coordinated group attacks as well as giving each wingman a personality of their own. Additionally, the player as squadron leader will be asked to make decisions (\"Yes/No\") while flying in the air. Between missions, the story is progressed through a series of cutscenes.",

Contains a faithful reproduction of the original arcade machine in Classic Mode. New Era mode: the simple rules of Space Invaders are expanded and twisted into a revolutionary step for the classic franchise. New Era mode takes the form of a world tour, with the player confronting the Space Invaders at 20 recognisable geographical locations. In total there are 60 levels to defend and 13 different types of invader to battle. Power-ups include protective shields, additional support craft, rapid-fire shots and column-clearing laser beams - essential aides as the action becomes progressively more intense. Power-ups can be used in combination: using support craft with laser results in three laser beams, decimating multiple waves of invaders with every press of the fire button.",

Three of its leaders, King, Boss, and Kong are all in the maximum security federal pen. And the final, fourth member of the E.V.I.L Inc. gang, international terrorist Joe Fang is believed to have been killed in a helicopter crash, though his body was never found. After the downfall of E.V.I.L Inc., a comprehensive investigation of their black market and gun-running activities was launched in the Virtua City bank.\nLast year it looked as though the Virtua Squad had finally put an end to the E.V.I.L Syndicate’s reign of crime over Virtua City. The gangleaders were all either behind bars, in intensive care, or under 6 feet of dirt. And the Virtua City Police Special Investigations Unit got a new member in the shape of Janet Marshall, an expert in criminal psychology profiling.\nThen trouble started brewing in unlikely places.... The vice-president of the Virtua City Bank was killed in shady circumstances that were only officially termed \"accidental\". And the swollen accounts of the now-defunct E.V.I.L Syndicate, which he had been suspected of laundering, were emptied overnight. The missing funds amounted to more than the GNP of most small countries.\nMeanwhile, on the other side of town, alarms break the quiet and calm of the Virtua City air. A daring daylight raid on the biggest jeweler’s in the state! And at the site of the new subway construction, there’s been an unusual amount of unexplained activity involving some very suspicious-looking materiel. Looks like the E.V.I.L is reborn.",

After the fruit and other crops have been harvested, it takes a little while until they grow back again. The scarecrow keeps thieving birds away from the crops. The Well: This is where Abbie draws water to give to the animals, for example.

This is never an easy task since their escorts and aircraft are waiting to ruin your day. The level of realism, and with it the difficulty, can be set by enabling or disabling ten options, e.g. unlimited ammo, clear sight or even invulnerability. \n \nCampaigns can be started in one of several time slots, allowing you to play for the entire war if you wish. During these campaigns you gain medals and promotions which includes the command of better submarines. You can also choose to play a single mission where you can set certain variables, e.g. number of ships or weather conditions. Specific missions aren\u0027t required because the engine \"rolls up\" convoys and targets, meaning every time you play the missions will change. The type and location of these missions depend on the historical time and the used submarine. \n \nThe submarine consists of several rooms where you can access the functions and instruments you\u0027ll need, e.g. the logbook in the captain\u0027s room or the fuel and battery prompt in the engine room. However, the most important functions can be brought up at any time, this includes the sea map where you set waypoints. The crew can take over certain tasks, e.g. identifying ships.",

    "summary": "NEXT GENERATION AG RACING IS HERE! Redout is a tribute to the old racing monsters such as F-Zero, WipeOut, Rollcage, and POD. It is designed to be an uncompromising, fast, tough and satisfying driving experience, soaked in that vertigo that stands at the core of the arcade racing genre. The floating system and driving models are based on physics: each turn, slope, hard braking, acceleration, each turn and twist of the track will apply a unique force to the ship. A sharp low-polygon style blends meshes and terrains with the latest state-of-the-art shading and lighting effects provided by the Unreal Engine 4, creating beautiful and instantly recognisable aesthetics. Breezy coastlines, eerie frozen landscapes, vast desert plains: the melancholic, dystopian atmosphere of a semi abandoned Earth is the background for the most high-speed, tense and beautiful futuristic racing clashes.",

    "summary": "Conarium is a chilling Lovecraftian game, which follows a gripping story involving four scientists and their endeavor to challenge what we normally consider to be the ‘absolute’ limits of nature. Inspired by H.P. Lovecraft’s novella \"At the Mountains of Madness\", but largely set after the original story.\n\nYou, as Frank Gilman, open your eyes inside a room filled with strange, pulsating noises. Patterns of lights executing a Danse Macabre on the walls is presented by a queer device on the table. Having recalled nothing other than that you’re in Upuaut, an Antarctic base located near south pole, you find the place deserted and have a distinct feeling of something being terribly wrong. Somehow knowing that your memories cannot guide you enforces a strange feeling of vulnerability, a familiar yet alien sensation of being a part of a peculiar whole... Soon you will discover that having used the device during the expedition, you have died but then returned subtly changed, speaking of strange memories and of strange places. You have lost something important or gained something sinister...\n\nExplore the antarctic base, as well as dreams and visions. Study clues, unlock secrets but avoid macabre beings at all cost.",

Think of this mod as being an enhanced version of Doom 64 for GZDoom. We have Doom 64 EX, Doom 64 Absolution TC, GZDoom64, and Brutal Doom 64. Why you ask? I was personally dissatisfied with the quality of the GZDoom64 project, and Brutal Doom 64 (while it is a great improvement) is along the same lines but changes too much and deviates from the original Doom 64 experience. And thus, this project was born.",
