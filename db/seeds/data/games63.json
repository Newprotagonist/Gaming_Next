This work adopts a multi-view system, and the player can select the character who will be the \"hero of the day\" for each day and enjoy the scenario from each viewpoint. In addition, a parameter called \"playing ability\" is set for each character, and the playing ability goes up and down in daily events, and everyone's level can be confirmed \"by ear\" in daily practice.","tags":[268435463,268435490],"videos":[{"id":42613,"video_id":"VAjOGly5dSA"}]},{"id":112365,"name":"Judged: A Court Simulator","platforms":[{"id":6,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}],"screenshots":[{"id":277210,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc5xwa.jpg"},{"id":277211,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc5xwb.jpg"},{"id":277212,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc5xwc.jpg"},{"id":277213,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc5xwd.jpg"},{"id":277214,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc5xwe.jpg"},{"id":277215,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc5xwf.jpg"}],"summary":"In Judged you start as a newly minted judge in lowly traffic court.

It has everything you love about RPG's – loot, levels and action. But instead of level grinding, you will rid the land of evil, one province at a time. To do this, you must combine your skill in combat with your ability to build a city capable of withstanding the enemy's assault and launching an attack on the enemy stronghold itself.\n\nGameplay consists of two main perspectives: FPS and city-building. There are dungeons to crawl and loot to procure, but the core gameplay comes during the city-building. As you rebuild the cities in each province, the enemy will not make it easy. You must construct your city so that it not only flourishes, but is well defended. Success requires not only a savvy mind for strategy, but skill with your crossbow to cut down the enemy before they reach your walls.\n\nYou will not be questing alone. As you travel throughout the land, you will rescue people who have been taken by the evil forces in the land. When you rescue them, they will be available to add to your party, or to reside in the main castle where their particular talents will aid your journey outside of combat. Fans of the Suikoden series will quickly recognize its influence on Heroes of Issachar.\n\nCombat\n\nThe action takes place as a first person shooter. Your signature weapon is a crossbow. Throughout the game, you will modify the crossbow, exchanging parts for new ones that confer a benefit to your skill and damage. In addition, there are mounting points for frost cannons, fireball launchers, magic shields, and many more add-ons. How you outfit your crossbow depends on you.\n\nIn addition to your crossbow, you will have a magic gauntlet that augments your skills. Different gems enhance different abilities, like speed, jumping, and even gliding. Other gems allow special skills like teleport and invisibility. Between the gauntlet and crossbow, you have the freedom to customize your combat in almost countless ways.","tags":[1,268435468,268435469,268435471,268435487,268435488]},{"id":32951,"name":"Detective Hunt - Crownston City PD","platforms":[{"id":6,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}],"screenshots":[{"id":56433,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/ldnkpooxuhrfoaveryc8.jpg"},{"id":56434,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/dndmws2n45ol7h3agtqc.jpg"},{"id":56435,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/ynz7dlehbu6qey99ulyq.jpg"},{"id":56436,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/wcenjkjjglqhi1aibkxs.jpg"},{"id":56437,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/h6f7jxqnmtws7qhgu7lv.jpg"}],"summary":"You are Damien Hunt, a junior detective of the Crownston City Police Department.

It was released on the MSX and Famicom Disk System on October 25, 1991; the FDS version was published by Tokuma Shoten as part of their \"Famimaga Disk\" line of games. The FDS version would later be released on a Famicom cart in 1993. Puyo Puyo would be succeeded by a much more popular arcade game of the same name.\n\nPuyo Puyo contains three modes: Endless, Mission, and Verses. In Endless Mode, players match Puyo until the top of their well is filled. If the player chooses, either a giant 2x2 green Puyo or Carbucle will periodically help the player clear space on their board. Mission mode gives the player several challenges to complete, such as clearing a set amount of Puyo or clearing all Puyo of a certain color. Verses mode allows players to battle each other.","tags":[268435465,268435471,536871208,536873787,536874694,536875181,536875379,536875434,536875472,536875871,536876348,536876930,536877573,536877609,536878299,536879119,536883100]},{"id":118224,"name":"Ninja Roquinexu","platforms":[{"id":6,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}],"screenshots":[{"id":313328,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc6prk.jpg"},{"id":313329,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc6prl.jpg"},{"id":313330,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc6prm.jpg"},{"id":313331,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc6prn.jpg"},{"id":313332,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc6pro.jpg"},{"id":313333,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc6prp.jpg"}],"summary":"You have challenged a criminal Syndicate, but are you strong enough to make it all the way up to the end?","tags":[1,268435488]},{"id":126752,"cover":{"id":172682,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co3p8q.jpg"},"name":"Dungeon Dreams (Female Protagonist)","platforms":[{"id":6,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}],"screenshots":[{"id":370328,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc7xqw.jpg"},{"id":370329,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc7xqx.jpg"},{"id":370330,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc7xqy.jpg"},{"id":370331,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc7xqz.jpg"},{"id":370332,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc7xr0.jpg"},{"id":370333,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc7xr1.jpg"}],"summary":"Roguelike Romance JRPG with a female protagonist.

The three infantry-based maps of Apocalypse reflect three of the bloodiest battles of World War I; Caporetto set in present-day Slovenia, Passchendaele in Belgium, and River Somme in France. The DLC brought no new factions to the game, but introduced a new game mode titled \"Air Assault\" in the remaining two maps. These two maps, both only plane- and zeppelin-focused, are named \"Razor's Edge\" and \"London Calling.\" While both maps feature combat above detailed landscapes (Razor's Edge taking place in the Alps and London Calling occurring over the city of London), neither are based on factual battles. Apocalypse brought new weapons and gadgets to Battlefield 1 as well. The weapons released include the RSC SMG, Howell Automatic, lMG 08/18, Ross MkIII, M1917 Enfield, and Webley Revolver Mk VI. In addition, melee weapons including the Broken Bottle, Wine Bottle, Meat Cleaver, and Prybar were introduced to the game. DICE and the Battlefield team also added a number of other components to the game, including vehicles, gadgets for various infantry classes, and the stationary Livens Projector/Gaswurfminen, located on each of the three infantry-based maps.

The game is based on testing the model of human intelligence developed by Dr. Masuo Koyasu at Kyoto University. \n \nPQ2: Practical Intelligence Quotient 2 shares many features with the first PQ game and similar platform-like puzzle games. In each stage, the player controls a human avatar in a virtual reality world, climbing and dropping from levels, lifting, dropping, pushing and pulling boxes in order to activate switches and lifts, block laser beams, and to create stairways in order to reach an exit point. The player must also avoid guards that make rounds on the level. \n \nThe main game is presented as an intelligence test of 100 stages. The player is given a total cumulative time of 5 hours to complete all 100 puzzles; time is only counted while the player is performing the puzzles, and the player can save and come back at any time without time penalty. The player's score is based on the number of \"moves\" (excluding walking around) on the stage, the time it took to complete it, and the number of attempts at that stage. A player can skip a stage with a scoring penalty; levels not completed in the 5 hour limit are also penalized against the player. Once completed, the player can upload their score to worldwide scoring tables to compare their results. \n \nObstacles in levels include: \n \nBoxes. Small opaque boxes can be picked up and dropped, and their height is the maximum height that the avatar can climb up on, thus these are commonly used to make stairs. Larger boxes can be pushed or pulled. \nGlass boxes. These boxes operate like regular boxes, but will shatter if dropped from any height or hit by something dropped on them. They also are translucent and will allow both laser and regular light through. \nLaser boxes. Like regular boxes but have laser beams that come out of one end. Crossing the beams will prematurely end the level. \nSwitch panels and switch boxes. Colored switches, when active, will activate platforms that may move across the field or that increase height, while deactivating a switch will cause these platforms to return to their original position. Floor panels are active by stepping on them or placing a box on them, while switch boxes require a laser beam to hit them. \nTeleporters. These can be moved like boxes and will teleport the avatar between the end points. \nPolice officers. These characters roam from one police call box to the next closest one, and shine a line in front of them. Should the avatar be caught in this light, the level must be restarted. The police call boxes can be moved to alter the police officier's behavior. \nDetectives. These characters will follow a specific roaming path until they discover footprints left by the avatar. At this point, they will follow the footprints until either the trail is lost, they find an obstacle they cannot pass through, or until they catch the avatar (which then will restart the level). Footprints will disappear after a number of steps, but can also be manipulated by using boxes and other obstacles. \nPQ2: Practical Intelligence Quotient 2 introduces the ability to create one's own levels to share with friends, and a \"weekly quiz\" that can be downloaded through the Internet.","tags":[268435465,536893253,536893254]},{"id":48170,"cover":{"id":27348,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/zupsxlxdbcxyd61kdkom.jpg"},"name":"Metal Storm","platforms":[{"id":18,"name":"Nintendo Entertainment System (NES)"}],"screenshots":[{"id":356267,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc7mwb.jpg"},{"id":356268,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc7mwc.jpg"},{"id":356269,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc7mwd.jpg"},{"id":356270,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc7mwe.jpg"},{"id":356271,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc7mwf.jpg"},{"id":356272,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc7mwg.jpg"}],"summary":"Battle station cyberg's massive computer that keeps peace throughout the solar system is no longer user friendly.

In the video game, the player assumes the role of a train hijacker who has commandeered a steam train to escape Nazi Germany during World War II. When the train is in motion the player must maintain the correct speed, steam pressure and other operational parameters of the train; also, the player must attempt to shoot down Nazi fighter planes which occasionally strafe the train by aiming and firing anti-aircraft guns mounted to the engine of the train. When the train occasionally stops briefly for resupply at various train stations, the player also must provide cover fire against attackers in the station buildings for comrades resupplying the train.\n\nThe Train was initially released for several 8-bit computer platforms, including the Commodore 64 and Apple II series, on which it was fairly popular. The game was also later released on IBM PC.","tags":[1,22,39,268435461,268435469,536870931,536872060,536873465,536873753,536875058,536875059,536875137,536875303,536877264,536877928],"videos":[{"id":60199,"video_id":"E4F5POZfRT4"},{"id":60200,"video_id":"P1Y-wC8yJ94"},{"id":60201,"video_id":"bBUIh_-_AEM"}]},{"id":89653,"name":"Cluster

From the perspective of the staff, specifically, the Campus Police Department:\nThe fear of finding strange things on the CCTV system.\nThe fear of patrolling the facilities late at night.\nThe fear of being too-late.In this release you will be receiving three chapters, each with a unique perspective, mechanic and atmosphere to immerse you in the story of West University. Specifically:\n\nChapter Zero: The Story\nAn opening chapter, where you will be introduced and playing Sergeant Thompson, the Night-Watch Commander for the University Police Department.

Initially released in Japan in 1997, the game was later ported to the PlayStation in 1999, with an English version of the game appearing on the platform in North America in the following September by Sony Computer Entertainment America, and later in Europe in March 2000 by Ubisoft. The game was produced by much of the same staff who worked on the company's previous role-playing endeavor, the Lunar series, including producer Yoichi Miyagi and music composer Noriyuki Iwadare.\n\nSince its release, Grandia has become notable for its combat mechanics which have been carried over to future games within the franchise, and has spawned two spin-off titles - Grandia: Digital Museum and Grandia: Parallel Trippers - both released exclusively in Japan. In celebration of the announcement of renewing development on Grandia Online, which acts as a prequel to Grandia, the game was re-released on Sony's PlayStation Network platform in Japan as a downloadable title in April 2009 and in North America on February 25, 2010. It was re-released in Europe on November 10, 2010.","tags":[17,268435468,536870916,536870928,536870990,536871008,536871138,536871139,536871186,536871208,536871213,536871244,536871327,536871390,536871400,536871433,536871470,536871474,536871581,536871682,536871931,536871938,536871969,536871972,536872120,536872140,536872232,536872257,536872425,536872440,536872544,536872647,536872649,536872668,536872733,536872898,536872953,536872959,536872977,536873017,536873024,536873030,536873066,536873192,536873327,536873328,536873455,536873878,536874398,536874688,536874706,536874743,536874745,536875042,536875058,536875059,536875074,536875076,536875082,536875095,536875100,536875109,536875125,536875131,536875147,536875148,536875150,536875152,536875156,536875161,536875196,536875199,536875228,536875232,536875236,536875255,536875271,536875284,536875286,536875287,536875300,536875304,536875307,536875319,536875328,536875331,536875338,536875340,536875380,536875420,536875440,536875449,536875453,536875455,536875494,536875523,536875525,536875537,536875540,536875570,536875606,536875621,536875640,536875673,536875695,536875699,536875712,536875731,536875738,536875756,536875761,536875764,536875777,536875792,536875793,536875803,536875822,536875829,536875830,536875855,536875870,536875891,536875917,536875923,536875934,536875952,536876007,536876019,536876032,536876073,536876095,536876098,536876169,536876184,536876220,536876232,536876241,536876271,536876286,536876315,536876316,536876333,536876349,536876353,536876429,536876460,536876490,536876508,536876522,536876528,536876554,536876564,536876571,536876575,536876592,536876612,536876687,536876700,536876711,536876730,536876764,536876770,536876847,536876854,536876874,536876919,536876946,536876967,536876969,536876972,536876975,536876976,536876996,536877029,536877176,536877210,536877216,536877424,536877453,536877490,536877533,536877596,536877632,536877633,536877634,536877635,536877762,536877771,536877811,536877853,536877934,536877942,536878005,536878078,536878257,536878292,536878335,536878369,536878406,536878464,536878472,536878562,536878611,536879107,536879149,536879818,536880028,536880195,536880218,536880243,536880264,536880286,536880328,536880471,536880549,536880662,536880968,536882890,536882965,536883640,536883836,536884031,536884863,536900657,536902076]},{"id":78222,"cover":{"id":114553,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co2ge1.jpg"},"name":"Noon","platforms":[{"id":7,"name":"PlayStation"},{"id":9,"name":"PlayStation 3"},{"id":32,"name":"Sega Saturn"}],"screenshots":[{"id":399820,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc8ki4.jpg"},{"id":399821,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc8ki5.jpg"},{"id":399822,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc8ki6.jpg"}],"summary":"Noon is a Action-Puzzle game, published by Micro Cabin, which was released in Japan in 1998.","tags":[1,268435465,536873787]},{"id":103225,"name":"DeepLands","platforms":[{"id":6,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}],"screenshots":[{"id":229838,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/qyktx7au5nwc6a9lrbja.jpg"},{"id":229839,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/mlahcx8tsvfrearglmjh.jpg"},{"id":229842,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/igszjeonlskygiu0ywfa.jpg"},{"id":229843,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/doxxf7xddvgev0j7l35v.jpg"},{"id":229844,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/mb4vpwmixwlxvoe3z6tr.jpg"},{"id":229845,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/ebdpmkw65vilyoeyoh14.jpg"}],"summary":"You have just bought a new house, and then your wife disappears.

The game was originally released in a box that featured the Family Fun Fitness logo.

Each player's adventure will take him between light and darkness and force him to adapt to an ever-changing world.","tags":[536871594],"videos":[{"id":44640,"video_id":"yxNipz4Rmxs"}]},{"id":57143,"cover":{"id":100435,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co25hv.jpg"},"name":"The Stranger","platforms":[{"id":3,"name":"Linux"},{"id":6,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"},{"id":14,"name":"Mac"}],"screenshots":[{"id":383571,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc87yr.jpg"},{"id":383572,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc87ys.jpg"},{"id":383573,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc87yt.jpg"},{"id":383574,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc87yu.jpg"},{"id":383575,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc87yv.jpg"}],"summary":"Enter the world of The Stranger, a first person adventure game from SVBLM. \n \nCoast through a tropical island, collecting trinkets and uncovering secrets as you zip through the trees courtesy of alien technology and ancient magic. \n \nMeet new friends and enemies as you shake up the inhabitants of this place on your quest to explore and learn about the island. \n \nGroove to an all-natural original electronic soundtrack by @JakeCataford. \n \nThis game was made for a senior project at Carleton University.","videos":[{"id":35786,"video_id":"PzxsSTxWHhg"}]},{"id":163863,"cover":{"id":165561,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co3jqx.jpg"},"name":"Doki Doki Gravity Dive","platforms":[{"id":3,"name":"Linux"},{"id":6,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}],"screenshots":[{"id":584017,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sccimp.jpg"},{"id":594038,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sccqd2.jpg"},{"id":594039,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sccqd3.jpg"},{"id":594040,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sccqd4.jpg"}],"summary":"Doki Doki Gravity Dive is a Score Attack Shoot 'em Up with tiny solar systems as your playground which are populated with tiny worlds and a singularity at their center.\n\nEnemies relentlessly invade and it is up to you to keep them at bay.
