Military units are now directly controlled, making fighting more similar to games like Command & Conquer or Age of Empires, than to the previous Settlers games.","tags":[22,268435467,268435469,268435471]},{"id":183120,"cover":{"id":199292,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co49rw.jpg"},"name":"PUBG: BATTLEGROUNDS - Season 13","platforms":[{"id":6,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"},{"id":48,"name":"PlayStation 4"},{"id":49,"name":"Xbox One"},{"id":167,"name":"PlayStation 5"},{"id":169,"name":"Xbox Series X|S"}],"screenshots":[{"id":692894,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sceun2.jpg"},{"id":692895,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sceun3.jpg"},{"id":692896,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sceun4.jpg"},{"id":692897,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sceun5.jpg"},{"id":692898,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sceun6.jpg"},{"id":692899,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sceun7.jpg"},{"id":692900,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sceun8.jpg"},{"id":692901,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sceun9.jpg"}],"summary":"Season 13 will introduce a series of updates to the recently released Taego map, which is set in 1980s South Korea.

Play as one of the Forsaken, the last frontier of humanity against the growing horrors of the Omnistructure. As you find yourself stranded in a faraway outpost, you must adapt in order to survive. The world won't wait for you though, you must venture into the unknown - your faith will decide your fate.\n\nFeel the burden of surviving in one of the last remaining outposts of the Forsaken, a legion of hunters condemned to protect the last vestige of humanity. The nature of your purpose however is shrouded in mystery, and as you delve deeper into the manifold halls of the Omnistructure, you will come to find the true meaning of alienation, isolation, and dread. A cross between cyberpunk, and dark fantasy - Bleak Faith will offer a story and experience that will be a breath of fresh air for all gamers looking for a something new. The world is full of lore, and every aspect of it is crafted with utmost passion and a dedication to art. As a baseline there is an estimated 30+ hours of content, a deep class system, and a procedural AI system that ensures that no playthrough is ever the same.\n\nThe architecture of the world, the Omnistructure, is a huge aspect of the game. Meticulously designed and crafted, Bleak Faith aims to provide an emergent narrative method coupled with more structured traditional moments. The world of Bleak Faith is labyrinthine, tapping into an innate curious instinct we all have when faced with many defined branching choices - we focus on creating a strong sense of curiosity about the path not taken, by offering unique and compelling content in every area of the world - having said that the world employs both vast open areas, and more linear openness in Metroidvania fashion. The aim is to evoke that same feeling of wonder and excitement that you felt the first time you played a game, the first time you experienced 3D graphics, the first time you experienced something that felt formative and not habitual. Open world in Bleak Faith is a crucial aspect to showing you the reality of the Forsaken. In this world there are few havens for the Forsaken, and these are generally outposts which serve as bases (of various complexities and utility) to recover from journeys and prepare for more - however, nowhere is truly safe!\n\nExpect tight and meticulously crafted and expanded combat that brings tempo and action to this world in amazing quality and detail. We're not shying away from a challenge, and so we're going all in. Despite being a small team, we couldn't accept a simple mundane combat system; we are making it fleshed out, and very robust. The combat communicates the danger in adrenaline-pumping fashion. Fast, responsive, and unforgiving - you will earn and feel every victory, nothing comes easy. Approach combat in your own way however - choose stealth over face-to-face combat, choose ranged over melee, choose Technomancy over more traditional combat styles. The system allows you to express yourself through combat, or through avoiding it - and that's further supported through a class system as well.\n\nHow better to experience the unyielding uncertainty of the Omnistructure than through a simulated ecosystem of factions and AI groups. Inhabitants of the Omnistructure will compete among themselves, grow and expand, change and adapt - the food chain in the ecosystem will, as a result, mold to every playthrough (e.g. an apex predator from your last playthrough might have already died out in this playthrough and you never fight it again). It's a constant race against time as enemies will try and outgrow and outsmart not only you, but other competition. Hunt, scavenge, and grow to stay on top of the food chain. Never experience an area the same way as the procedural nature of the ecosystem will ensure that you can never let your guard down. Having said that, there are still linear areas of the game, especially those that cover main plot points - to ensure a direction and purpose for the player. The ecosystem makes every moment of gameplay interesting and engaging - even on multiple playthroughs.\n\nFight against the odds, and stay alive despite the Omnistructure's evergrowing threat. Craft, scavenge, hunt, and find ways to excel. Pick a class, upgrade stats, augment your character, create equipment and stay healthy. Resist the Puppet Plague, and the many afflictions present in the world which can change the outcome of your journey entirely. Use stealth and your environment to your advantage - fighting is not always the best course of action, and when it is, preparing the field to shift the odds in your favor is a necessary tactic.","tags":[1,17,19,21,38,268435468,268435481,268435487,268435488],"videos":[{"id":29766,"video_id":"TT1_vbvGxoc"},{"id":29767,"video_id":"m5PDvck23hY"}]},{"id":197292,"cover":{"id":217270,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co4nna.jpg"},"name":"Jigsaw Novel: Double Trouble","platforms":[{"id":6,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}],"summary":"Layla Scott can't decide which is her favorite: the dean or the physics teacher so she takes both of them.

The shipyard allows players to construct their ship piece by piece. Ships can be as simplistic as a cockpit, a hull, a engine and a gun, or as complex as a player wants. Each module has available subsystems which can be applied to strengthen specific attributes of the ship, and when damaged, those subsystems may be destroyed. While in space flight, interactions between objects are governed by the physics engine. Running into an asteroid at high speed will damage your ship, potentially with catastrophic effects. Using the Kinetic Field Generator (KFG) in game will allow your ship to create an artificial gravity around the ship, both protecting the ship as well as allowing your ship to fly freely through space. This field will also enable the Micro Warp Drive, catapulting your ship far into space in a matter of seconds. Kinetic Void is a procedurally generated adventure, there is no main story line. The decisions and direction is left up to the player. Ally with factions, go to war, build your ship and amass wealth, the choices are yours. \n\nProcedural galaxy creation allows as many new experiences as you'd like. When a new game is started, the galaxy map, contents of each sector, and the factions involved will be generated from scratch. You may continue to play this galaxy, or if you'd like to try something different, create a brand new galaxy. Don't worry, your old galaxy will be saved in its current state if you ever wish to return. Choose how many sectors you'd like in your galaxy, as well as how many factions (NPCs) and whether your ships will be Creative or Career mode.Know Your Neighbors. \nIn Kinetic Void the galaxy is a living, breathing thing. Not all factions get along, not all of them hate each other. As factions interact, agreements and treaties will be made and broken. Trade, combat and piracy will affect how the factions see each other based on their own internal standings.\n\nTailor your ship for any role. Make a sleek fighter, a bulky freighter, or a mighty carrier. Your ship’s capabilities and appearance are completely up to you. Using Kinetic Void’s ship builder you can make exactly the ship you want. Customize every part of your ship from cockpits, hulls, engines, weapons, and aesthetic modules. Each module has its own statistics that affect the total performance of your ship. Every module can be further customized by adding subsystems (right click on a module to add subsystems). You can even color your ship exactly how you want. Each module has seven color fields allowing you to make amazing ships quickly, and easily. Once your ship is created, save it to your computer, or share it to the Steam Workshop for the world to see. Subscribed ships from the workshop have a random chance of making it into any new galaxy as a faction vessel.\n\nBe the scourge of the galaxy, or its savior. A life of combat and struggle not your thing? Become an intergalactic trader and influence the galaxy one deal at a time. Not interested in being a ‘good guy’? Take on a life of piracy and plunder your way through sectors, creating havoc wherever you go, then docking at pirate stations for supplies as needed.Intense Active Combat. \nTarget enemy ships and maneuver in real time to align devastating broad-sides or crippling strafing runs. Deploy drones to do your dirty work or simply confuse the enemy into targeting them instead of you while you deal with the enemy vessel. In Kinetic Void, your skills as a pilot are just as important as the components that make up your ship.Take Direct Control Of Your \n\nKinetic Void offers three control modes. In cursor-mode, the player can control the ship through keyboard commands, and pan the camera with the mouse in any direction for quick tactical overview; or Mouse Flight-mode, allowing direct control of the ship through mouse movements. Control your battleship’s turrets from a sweeping orbital camera or slip between asteroids in a dogfight while piloting your heavy-fighter using mouse flight mode. Switch between modes at any time to best suit the situation.","tags":[1,18,33,268435469,268435488,536871009,536871338,536871882,536872060,536872406,536875060,536875187],"videos":[{"id":45637,"video_id":"7JH8SwL1oW0"}]},{"id":134722,"cover":{"id":118724,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co2jlw.jpg"},"name":"Hyperplex 3D","platforms":[{"id":6,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"},{"id":34,"name":"Android"}],"summary":"3D remaster of the original Supaplex with a build-in level editor."},{"id":36090,"cover":{"id":180554,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co3vbe.jpg"},"name":"Pilot Brothers 2","platforms":[{"id":6,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}],"screenshots":[{"id":90510,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/u5klmxmdih3hmlbgtqrw.jpg"},{"id":90511,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/xmfumb3vwbyqfw1mgp2d.jpg"},{"id":90512,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/yye3esd4tyczwfcnxnek.jpg"},{"id":90513,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/o0qt2igd9ndgwlsf7l3b.jpg"},{"id":90514,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/eqydlwq3pnqxcxo58hrh.jpg"}],"summary":"Join the famed duo in their search for the serial maniac!","tags":[27,268435487,536871939],"videos":[{"id":26105,"video_id":"EwOEpYXTsDo"}]},{"id":185917,"cover":{"id":200770,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co4awy.jpg"},"name":"The Binding of Isaac: Game Boy Edition","platforms":[{"id":33,"name":"Game Boy"}],"screenshots":[{"id":704033,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scf38h.jpg"},{"id":704034,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scf38i.jpg"}],"summary":"A demake for the classic roguelike The Binding of Isaac originally developed by Edmund McMillen and Florian Himsl.

Based upon the gameplay of the Age of Empires series, it was originally developed by Robot Entertainment, but on February 24, 2011, Gas Powered Games, took over production. The game was published by Microsoft. \n \nThe game was free-to-play—it was free for users to play, though premium content could be earned or purchased, such as access to special items and blueprints, and more quests and features. \n \nOn March 27, 2012, the game premiered on Steam after a major overhaul patch which addressed complaints of an \"MMO-like grind\" and many other features, along with the debut of the Celtic civilization. On June 15, 2012 the premium content system was changed to offer the option to purchase all past and future content through \"Empire points\" earned in game, or by purchasing the points directly with real world money. \n \nAs of January 3, 2013, Microsoft ceased further development on the game. A Microsoft representative later announced on the forums that on August 22, 2013, the Games for Windows – Live Marketplace would be shut down, leaving the game only accessible by current or former players. In September 2013, it was announced that the game would remain functional until July 1, 2014 when the service would be shut down. The closure was due to the content being too expensive to maintain. \n \nIn 2017, Age of Empires Online was reestablished using Microsoft's publicly released developer-kit for the game and is now hosted on a server emulator known as \"Project Celeste\". The game can be played for free in single-player and multiplayer mode with all online features fully enabled. In May 2019, the team announced that they are developing Microsoft's unreleased Roman civilization for play based upon all known data of the civilization before the official servers were closed.
