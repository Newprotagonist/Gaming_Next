The game is both a sequel and a remake to the previous year's Street Fighter Alpha: Warriors' Dreams, which is itself a prequel to the Street Fighter II series in terms of plot and setting.\n\nThe single-player mode, much like the original Street Fighter Alpha, consists of eight matches with computer-controlled opponents, including a fixed final opponent whose identity depends on the player's selected character. Each character also has a secret \"rival\" whom they can face during the course of the single-player mode after meeting certain requirements, in which then the rival will interrupt one of the player's regularly scheduled matches and exchange dialogue with the player's character. With Akuma now a regular character, a more powerful version of the character dubbed \"Shin Akuma\" replaces him as a secret opponent. Unlike Super Turbo and the original Alpha, Shin Akuma challenges the player before the player's final opponent, rather than as an alternate final boss.","tags":[1,268435460,268435487,268435489,536870973,536871019,536871200,536871213,536871353,536871384,536871784,536871889,536871987,536872100,536872143,536872225,536872862,536872873,536873064,536874398,536875073,536875075,536875156,536875183,536875198,536875206,536875284,536875359,536875383,536875434,536875448,536875478,536875531,536875582,536875638,536875778,536875819,536875833,536876084,536876113,536876240,536876266,536876308,536876310,536876805,536876806,536876809,536876813,536876824,536876825,536876828,536876829,536876831,536876832,536876834,536876842,536876996,536877000,536877012,536877016,536877058,536877237,536877238,536877380,536877416,536877441,536877696,536877938,536877985,536878199,536878212,536878299,536878351,536878353,536878552,536879969,536880798,536880924,536881112,536881271,536881366,536882308,536882477,536882765,536882785,536883325,536883458,536883865,536883943,536884403]},{"id":159757,"cover":{"id":193567,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co45cv.jpg"},"name":"Living together with Fox Demon","platforms":[{"id":6,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}],"screenshots":[{"id":555867,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scbwwr.jpg"},{"id":555879,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scbwx3.jpg"},{"id":555881,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scbwx5.jpg"}],"summary":"You encountered a snowstorm while climbing a snowy mountain.

The gateway guns allow you to place two gateways on the walls, floors and ceilings of the lab so that when you pass through one you emerge out of the other.  As progress is made through the game different types of gateway gun are introduced with different effects.  After the basic gun, you acquire a gun that creates two gateways of different sizes, passing through one way shrinks Ed to half his size and the other way makes Ed grow to twice his size.  Then you find a gun where one gateway doesn't just connect to the others location but also its time, allowing Ed to travel back in time and encounter earlier versions of himself.

In addition, the game was now playable indefinitely, which was very popular with the players. There was also a new game mode: \"real managerial career\".

From inside a magical book, players use their deck of cards to create a quest for their legend. Legends earn gold as they progress through the quest, fighting enemy cards, which players can spend to aid their legends. Enemy players will be creating their own quests and may steal gold or weapons. In the end, players do battle against each other, with the victor being the last one standing.\n\nIt was a multiplayer game that was planned to have integration with RuneScape in the form of gaining additional cards. The beta version was released on 25 November 2015 and was officially released on Steam on 26 May 2016.\n\nOn 8 May 2018, it was announced that the game would be removed due to \"multiple technical issues\" combined with a dwindling player base.

The object of the game is to ski down an endless slope and avoid the obstacles (trees, stumps, dogs, etc.) The player can also opt to partake in three modes: slalom, freestyle, and tree slalom. In slalom, players must properly ski around flags in an attempt to complete the run with the shortest time possible. Tree slalom adds obstacles to the slalom run. In freestyle, players ski downhill and jump off ramps while racking up points by performing tricks. Deductions are imposed for colliding into obstacles or failing to land properly after a stunt. When the player passes the 2,000-meter mark, the Abominable Snowman appears and starts to chase the player, eating them if it catches them.","tags":[268435470,268435489,536871470,536871549,536871611,536871829,536871914,536872078,536872287,536872617,536872621,536872622,536872628,536872629,536872810,536872847,536874706,536875050,536875075,536875168,536875520,536875909,536876008,536876200,536876205,536876629,536876718,536879198],"videos":[{"id":5077,"video_id":"Jvtq-ql0LmY"}]},{"id":196867,"cover":{"id":216807,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co4naf.jpg"},"name":"Dairantou Kanoair Smash 2002","platforms":[{"id":6,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}],"summary":"A doujin fighting game using characters from visual novels Kanon and Air.","tags":[268435460,268435488,536888510,536889693,536896651]},{"id":30786,"cover":{"id":31368,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/vdfcmhmouyxypvtmc990.jpg"},"name":"Orbox C","platforms":[{"id":6,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}],"screenshots":[{"id":74441,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/wxxhxjvzf9zlz9jnhptx.jpg"},{"id":74442,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/avujvlxuyvo90vkloqqt.jpg"},{"id":74443,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/i1ukc0cbhpxdqhrhdm8u.jpg"},{"id":74444,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/g6vslactqldvone77uvq.jpg"},{"id":74445,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/vy8lhvy1q1mljvsleriy.jpg"}],"summary":"Orbox C is a great puzzle game with sliding block in space.

The player assumes a role of Hajime who after going to visit your best friend, finds himself trapped in a hospital along with your two friends, Ryou and Tomowo, and a rookie nurse Aya. The gameplay consists of exploring locations in the hospital by moving in a certain direction (forward, turn left or right, or turn back) which uses pre-rendered animation for every movement from one point to another. Certain locations can be zoomed in to give you more details or to pick up an item. Your companions will often give you some comments while you explore, mostly of which may seem a selection of five sentences that are randomly selected. The game also features the use of player's senses (sight, hearing, touch, smell and taste) which must be used at key locations and events in order to progress the game.","tags":[268435487,536871939],"videos":[{"id":29061,"video_id":"oGJVXPjWOuQ"}]},{"id":130329,"cover":{"id":199961,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co4aah.jpg"},"name":"void.Resign","platforms":[{"id":3,"name":"Linux"},{"id":6,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}],"summary":"A text adventure game inspired by Edgar Allan Poe's The Cask of Amontillado.","tags":[18,268435487,268435488],"videos":[{"id":62132,"video_id":"S-nAAWQdzeI"}]},{"id":135409,"cover":{"id":107751,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co2b53.jpg"},"name":"Clonk Extreme","platforms":[{"id":3,"name":"Linux"},{"id":6,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"},{"id":14,"name":"Mac"}],"summary":"Clonk Extreme is a 3D online multiplayer game set in the world of the Clonk series. \n \nThe game features fast paced tactical team battles and deathmatches in various scenarios.","videos":[{"id":37859,"video_id":"G0pYoHwXu0Y"},{"id":37860,"video_id":"sivhSn7CQUs"},{"id":37861,"video_id":"4qSsp-h7JRI"}]},{"id":135827,"cover":{"id":110490,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co2d96.jpg"},"name":"The Elder Scrolls Online: Stonethorn","platforms":[{"id":6,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"},{"id":14,"name":"Mac"},{"id":48,"name":"PlayStation 4"},{"id":49,"name":"Xbox One"},{"id":170,"name":"Google Stadia"}],"screenshots":[{"id":393174,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc8fdi.jpg"},{"id":393175,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc8fdj.jpg"},{"id":393176,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc8fdk.jpg"}],"summary":"Confront a rising threat and uncover a monstrous secret with Castle Thorn and Stone Garden, two challenging dungeons that continue the year-long saga.","tags":[1,17,268435468,268435487],"videos":[{"id":38635,"video_id":"Xxlssu7KUXA"}]},{"id":193536,"cover":{"id":219348,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co4p90.jpg"},"name":"Lover Pretend","platforms":[{"id":130,"name":"Nintendo Switch"}],"screenshots":[{"id":781740,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scgr70.jpg"},{"id":781741,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scgr71.jpg"},{"id":781742,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scgr72.jpg"},{"id":781743,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scgr73.jpg"}],"summary":"Lights, camera, action!

One such hero is a farmer in the small village of West Harbor. Raised by the elven ranger, Daeghun, as his own child, our hero will embark on a grandiose quest against the King of Shadows. Neverwinter Nights 2 is the tale of his deeds. His adventures continue in Neverwinter Nights 2: Mask of the Betrayer. Our protagonist discovers that an ominous spell has fallen on him. A curse of perpetual hunger--one which can only be quelled by consuming the souls of spirits. In order to remove the curse, he has to travel to the Shadow Realm, which harbors dark secrets and tormented souls. \n \nNeverwinter Nights 2: Storm of Zehir gives as a breather from grand quests of destiny and epic ordeals. You simply assemble a group of four adventurers (either by carefully picking out each of their statistics and skills or by randomly re-rolling your characters until you find the ones that suit you) and go where the wind takes you. Just make sure to get a good look at the map as you will need it to explore the wide open region of Samarach and the Sword Coast. Then, yet another adventure: in an ancient and forgotten tomb you found an unusual mask. It made you quite powerful but changed your life into a living nightmare. Strange, terrifying visions torment your psyche. Every time you try to get rid of the accursed mask, it secretly makes its way back to you. There's just one solution: set sail for Westgate and discover the secret of the Night Masks in Neverwinter Nights 2: Mysteries of Westgate. \n \nNeverwinter Nights 2: Complete is an epic RPG set in the fantasy world of the Forgotten Realms, one of the most popular campaign settings of Dungeons & Dragons.

The PSP version follows closely on the heels of its PS2 tag-teammate in terms of features and wrestler rosters, with exclusive extras including additional characters and other features for the PSP version, plus USB system link to connect the two versions together.","tags":[1,32,268435460,268435470,536871146,536872078,536875090,536875140,536875183,536875186,536875189,536875190,536875229,536875271,536875537,536875557,536875562,536875716,536875803,536875895,536876199,536876208,536876210,536876606,536877405,536877406,536878023,536878212,536878304,536878557,536879181,536880134,536880425,536880441,536881372,536882583,536882913,536883028,536883466],"videos":[{"id":30730,"video_id":"JYUr_lm4sd4"}]},{"id":17530,"name":"BattleSpace","platforms":[{"id":3,"name":"Linux"},{"id":6,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"},{"id":14,"name":"Mac"}],"screenshots":[{"id":94304,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/cfci4ie1h2qmqnob4dqo.jpg"},{"id":94305,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/abclrdhvudajygxc8dio.jpg"},{"id":94306,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/mrveoyuqu9j04kssgugg.jpg"},{"id":94307,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/jxsiormasw1n1r56qhq3.jpg"},{"id":94308,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/kifmzt7sxck3nhkjcfaz.jpg"}],"summary":"BattleSpace is a sci-fi flash game designed to play in the comfort of your web browser.

Today people still continue searching for these missing \"disc stones\" to unlock the lifeforms within. In the anime, the monsters were created by scientists. \n \nIt is said that one monster is trapped inside each one. One day a group of workers excavating the ancient ruins happened to dig up one of these mythical disc stones. The worker who first discovered a disc stone took the disc to the Monsters' Temple. There the priests, using the ancient methods, unlocked the monster inside the disc stone. In a place where ranchers and monsters coexisted peacefully, the battle of the monsters began. As time passed these monster battles became extremely popular, and monster breeding became the standard pastime of the land. Eventually disc stones were found around the entire world.
