More heavily laden units may tire more easily, and may have to rest to avoid running out of action points more quickly in subsequent turns. Morale also plays a factor; a unit witnessing the deaths of his teammates can panic and run out of the player's control.\n\nIncluding the expansion pack, there are seven scenarios in total, each one with its own difficulty settings and squad allocation\n\nLaser Squad originally came with five mission scenarios, with an expansion pack released for the 8-bit versions, containing a further two scenarios.

This was Peter Molyneux's final project with Bullfrog before he left the company in August 1997 to form Lionhead Studios.\n\nThe player uses a mouse, represented in-game as a hand, to interact with a bar on the left-hand side of the screen, allowing them to select which rooms to build and which spells to cast. The player can also use the hand to pick up creatures and objects in the dungeon and carry them around, allowing for tactics such as gathering an assault force and dropping off the creatures en masse once a foothold has been established. The hand also allows the player to \"slap\" objects and thereby interact with them: creatures will hurry up when slapped, some traps will be triggered and prisoners in the Torture Chamber can be tortured.\n\nThe main game view is in isometric perspective; this view can be zoomed and rotated. The player also has the option of possessing one of their creatures, and seeing the dungeon from that creature's first-person perspective, as well as using their attacks and abilities. The map is divided into a grid of rectangles, most of which are invisible. A smaller part of the map is shown as a minimap in the top left corner of the screen.\n\nA world map is also available, and at the beginning of the game the player is allocated one of the 20 regions of a fictional, idyllic country to destroy. As the player progresses through these regions, each of which represents a level of the game, the areas previously conquered will appear ransacked, twisted, and evil. Before starting a new level, the Mentor will tell the player about the current region and its attributes. After completing a level, the Mentor will talk about the \"improvement\" of the destroyed region: \"The streets run with the blood of the slain. Screams of pain and howls of anguish rip the night air like a vengeful siren's song. This really is somewhere you can take the kids for the weekend.\"\n\nThe Dungeon Heart represents the Dungeon Keeper's own link to the world. If it is destroyed, the player loses the level, and must restart. Along with the heart, the player begins with a small number of imps, the generic work force for all dungeon activities: they can dig tunnels into the surrounding soil, capture enemy rooms and Portals, mine gold and gems, set traps, and even attack when desperate or threatened. Slapping creatures forces them to work faster for a while, but removes some of their health and happiness.\n\nOnce the Imps are busily working, the player must then set up a basic infrastructure: Lairs for monsters, a Hatchery (where chickens, which serve as food for the minions, are bred), and a Treasury for storing gold. After connecting the dungeon to a \"Portal\", monsters will arrive. As the game progresses, the player moves along a technology tree, unlocking further rooms.\n\nThe dungeon has a fleshed-out ecology: some creatures are natural enemies. Flies and Spiders are often found at odds with one another, while a Horned Reaper, if it has gone berserk, will attack all creatures in its path.

The goal is to line up five pieces in a row.\n\nGomoku Narabe Renju is a video game simulation of a traditional Eastern board game that uses the board and pieces from the popular board game Go. It plays a lot like the American board game Connect Four, in which the goal is to line up a series of five tiles horizontally, vertically or diagonally before the other player can do the same. Two players take it in turns to place a single Go tile on the board, attempting to craft their own lines while strategically placing tiles that blocks the opponent from finishing theirs.\n\nWhile the normal board game is simply referred to as \"Gomoku Narabe\" (Five Pieces in a Row, occasionally translated as Gobang), the Renju modifier is an additional rule that makes it harder for the player with the black pieces to win. Because the black player always begins each game (like how the white player always begins each game of Chess), this additional rule is thought to even the playing field. The rule is that the black player will lose if they build a line of six or more pieces: this counts as going \"overlong\" and counts as a loss.\n\nGomoku Narabe Renju is the fourth video game ever released on the Famicom, and the first original game produced for the system (the previous three - Donkey Kong, Donkey Kong Jr. and Popeye - were all ports of arcade games). It was released the same day (August 27th, 1983) as the Famicom version of Mahjong, another board game adaptation.","tags":[268435491,536873513,536875046,536875051,536875471,536901402],"videos":[{"id":57273,"video_id":"WaPXlBtPAqw"}]},{"id":4859,"cover":{"id":135286,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co2wdy.jpg"},"name":"Inspector Gadget","platforms":[{"id":19,"name":"Super Nintendo Entertainment System (SNES)"}],"screenshots":[{"id":291770,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc694q.jpg"},{"id":291771,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc694r.jpg"},{"id":291772,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc694s.jpg"}],"summary":"Inspector Gadget is on yet another mission against the evil Doctor Claw and his army of M.A.D.

Our goal is an evolutionary leap forward driven by our compulsive interest in science fiction, role-playing, military realism, and respect for first person immersion.","tags":[1,18,21,268435461,268435468,268435469,268435480,268435488,536871029,536871079,536871251,536871365,536871378,536871390,536871393,536871576,536871719,536871784,536871799,536871835,536871882,536871937,536871938,536872070,536872205,536872358,536872622,536872746,536873122,536873405,536873455,536874706,536874947,536875060,536875173,536875242,536875358,536875453,536875483,536875573,536875610,536875624,536875802,536875807,536875822,536875885,536876221,536876687,536876700,536877807,536881457]},{"id":169022,"cover":{"id":177544,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co3szs.jpg"},"name":"Escape The Outbreak","platforms":[{"id":6,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}],"screenshots":[{"id":618595,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scd9b7.jpg"},{"id":618601,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scd9bd.jpg"},{"id":618604,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scd9bg.jpg"},{"id":618608,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scd9bk.jpg"},{"id":618611,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scd9bn.jpg"},{"id":618614,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scd9bq.jpg"},{"id":618616,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scd9bs.jpg"},{"id":618618,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scd9bu.jpg"},{"id":618621,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scd9bx.jpg"},{"id":618623,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scd9bz.jpg"},{"id":618624,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scd9c0.jpg"},{"id":618628,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scd9c4.jpg"}],"summary":"On a remote island, Jack Colt finds himself isolated after being kidnapped.

Industry is revolutionized overnight and a short period of chaos gives way to all warring factions uniting under a common banner.A few years pass and the peace brought about by Gate Technology crumbles once a new threat appears; a race of energy parasites that have crossed through the Dimensional Gate by mimicking the very materials humanity had believed they were replicating. Mankind is quickly overtaken as their technology is turned against them and the energy emitted by the parasites begins to take control of those exposed.In an act of desperation, the experimental RSK9 is constructed, a ship made of Pre-Gate materials and technology with the ability to absorb parasite energy and use it to power its incredible arsenal. Piloting the RSK9 is Alys, an ace pilot previously missing in action that has returned seemingly immune to parasite control. Her skill and resistance to the parasite energies influence make her the only pilot capable of preventing the extinction of mankind.NOTE FOR LINUX USERS - Due to game engine limitations we are only able to guarantee compatibility with Ubuntu 18.04.2 LTS 64bit or newer. It is likely it will function on many other Linux distributions but it is impossible currently to be 100% sure. We very much want to support the Linux community and are happy to entertain suggestions on how we may improve compatibility in the future.GAME PLAY:-Increase your B-Meter & firepower quickly by flying as close to enemy fire as possible and absorbing their energy. The closer you fly, the more energy you net!-Fire your weapon while flying close to enemy fire and absorbing to perform powerful \"Risk Shots\".

Taking a unique and meta approach towards the Gundam universe, Gundam Breaker 3continues the formula of bringing about action-packed mecha on mecha battles that revolve around one of the core aspects of the series: Gunpla aka Gundam Model Kits! For those new to this specific spin-off, the core mechanics revolve around the creative choice of building your own Gundam based on the many real-life parts featured in the game; the previous title, Gundam Breaker 2, including over 100 Gunpla kits to choose from, which massively increased the number of options and customizations available to a total of over 10,000,000,000 different options! Customization is a big part of the Gundam Breaker series and the upcoming release will channel that mindset by allowing players more to choose from when it comes to Gunpla colors, as well as the plating coating and dirtiness, and the expression of damage. In addition to missile pods, rail cannons, beam launchers, and other weapons, there is expansion equipment with various abilities that can be equipped. This will allow players to create a Full Armor Mobile Suit of their own! The SD (Super Deformed) series of Gundam will now also be available in support roles, who will take instructions from the player during battles. SD Gundams can only be set to \"Module,\" the effects of which will extend to the full team. A new \"Bounty Hunter Mode\" has been added to the series. In this mode, players will be able to battle against Gunpla that have been uploaded by other players, and the victor will walk away with in-game currency. The Break Edition includes all the DLC of the normal edition.","tags":[1]},{"id":22013,"aggregated_rating":80.0,"cover":{"id":122885,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co2mth.jpg"},"name":"Zax: The Alien

Taking place in a kingdom with tomatoes abound, the gameplay is similar to that of the Mario & Luigi series.\n\nTomato Adventure, in terms of gameplay mechanics, is the predecessor of the Mario & Luigi series of games, even having its engine reused in the first installment on the GameBoy Advance. Originally developed for the Game Boy Color, Tomato Adventure transitioned to its successor, the Game Boy Advance, when the latter was released. The main difference between the two versions is believed to lie in the quality of audio and graphics, although little substantial information exists on the Game Boy Color version.\n\nTomato Adventure incorporates a number of RPG standards such as leveling up and travelling to various places to advance the plot. However, the battle system itself is substantially different than most games in the genre, as players have a more active role in how the fights turn out. During the player's turn, they can select a character's attack and then their target. From there, they must perform one of a number of different minigames which determines how successful the attack is. These range from simple button mashers to stopping a meter at a specific point. While attacks can land without reaching the optimal point, their effectiveness tends to be severed in the process. Additionally, each attack has a separate amount of usage points which dictate how many times the player can use that specific attack before needing to revitalize themselves.","tags":[1,17,27,268435468,268435487,536870990,536871262,536871938,536875074,536875472,536877434,536878052,536878078,536881401,536895518,536896177,536900657,536901402],"videos":[{"id":57292,"video_id":"oSw1aiVpbvk"}]},{"id":8154,"cover":{"id":8603,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/z65evxzdd5oyop3vh7y7.jpg"},"name":"Jackie Chan Adventures","platforms":[{"id":8,"name":"PlayStation 2"},{"id":12,"name":"Xbox 360"},{"id":38,"name":"PlayStation Portable"}],"screenshots":[{"id":317506,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc6szm.jpg"}],"summary":"Jackie Chan Adventures is based on the hit kid's action cartoon of the same name, which features Jackie as an ancient artifact expert and special agent for the government's secret \"Section 13\".

Covert Assault is no different in this regard, as you'll take on the role of two different elite rangers as they scour the globe, quietly ridding it of evil at every turn.\n\nIn Covert Assault, you choose two rangers from a host of different soldiers with their own abilities. Select from the machine gunner, close-quarters fighter, sniper, grenadier, and rifleman. Once you've chosen your rangers, you will be able to customize them with a whole host of different guns and items such as body armor and grenades. You then enter into the game, which is made up of four different missions, ranging from the island of Sicily to the deep anonymous jungles of a far away place.","tags":[1,39,268435461,268435480,536870913,536871213,536871379,536871470,536871475,536871576,536871809,536871937,536872019,536875122,536875171,536875271,536875642,536876221,536876232,536876240,536876933,536880725,536881372,536881514]},{"id":7165,"aggregated_rating":60.0,"cover":{"id":7339,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/fxosakc2busrnyvs9rul.jpg"},"name":"Rugby World Cup 2011","platforms":[{"id":9,"name":"PlayStation 3"},{"id":12,"name":"Xbox 360"}],"screenshots":[{"id":116614,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/md9k3zfvrdlwovpu21q4.jpg"},{"id":116615,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/u5ecmcunayskfubzgwlc.jpg"},{"id":116616,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/rv2nuij460yj3frtidbw.jpg"},{"id":116617,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/z89tti2n8bcg4kpo9bg6.jpg"},{"id":116618,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/aobaeqthyv9agnzyyj8a.jpg"}],"summary":"Rugby World Cup 2011 is a rugby union video game developed by HB Studios[1] and 505 Games. \n \nThe game is the official video game of the 2011 Rugby World Cup, and was released on both the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 on 25 August 2011.[2] It was released in North America on 6 September 2011, with the PlayStation 3 version available via the PlayStation Store.","tags":[268435470,536871225,536872078,536872205,536873274,536873455,536875046,536875054,536875157,536875186,536875271,536875562,536875802,536876190,536876695,536878111,536878281,536888127,536890887,536892499,536892500]},{"id":178157,"cover":{"id":190775,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co437b.jpg"},"name":"Europa Universalis IV: Digital Extreme Edition Upgrade Pack","platforms":[{"id":6,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}],"summary":"This compilation is made up from the content originally included in the Digital Extreme edition of Europa Universalis IV, that being Europa Universalis IV: The Stars and Crescent Pack, Europa Universalis IV: The Horsemen of the Crescent Unit Pack, Europa Universalis IV: The Conquest of Constantinople Music Pack, Europa Universalis IV: American Dream, Europa Universalis IV: The 100 Years War Unit Pack and Europa Universalis IV: The Purple Phoenix Expansion."},{"id":129295,"cover":{"id":121530,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co2lru.jpg"},"name":"Gunman And The Witch","platforms":[{"id":6,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}],"screenshots":[{"id":360202,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc7pxm.jpg"},{"id":360203,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc7pxn.jpg"},{"id":360204,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc7pxo.jpg"},{"id":360205,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc7pxp.jpg"},{"id":360206,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc7pxq.jpg"},{"id":360207,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc7pxr.jpg"}],"summary":"Wild West City-Builder meets Top-Down Shooter!

For example, subsidies to bicycles will encourage people to exercise more (in the long run decreasing health costs) and will also encourage less people to own cars and be members of the motorists group. Other policies to encourage entrepreneurship amongst young people will eventually lead to more people becoming self employed, and so on…\n\nA total of 26 policies and 8 dilemmas are included in the expansion, including food labelling, car-pooling, Labor Day bank holiday, witness protection schemes, a diplomatic service, armed forces week, free parenting classes, and much more.

The player controls the marble's movements with a trackball, though most home versions use game controllers with directional pads. The aim of the game is for the player to complete six maze-like, isometric race courses before a set amount of time expires. When a player completes a race, the remaining time is added to the next race's allotted time. The game also allows two players to compete against each other. \n \nCourses are populated with various objects and enemies designed to obstruct the player. As the game progresses, the courses become increasingly difficult and introduce more enemies and obstacles. Each course has a distinct visual theme. For example, the first race, titled \"Practice\", is a simple course that is much shorter than the others, while the fifth race, named \"Silly\", features polka-dot patterns and is oriented in a direction opposite from the other courses","tags":[1,268435464,268435465,268435466,268435471,268435489,536871307,536872044,536872407,536872961,536873064,536873787,536873991,536875075,536875301,536875361,536875404,536875465,536875610,536875875,536876005,536876120,536876619,536877745,536881973],"videos":[{"id":3561,"video_id":"bTtM0QTKfnc"}]},{"id":175975,"cover":{"id":185713,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co3zap.jpg"},"name":"Sonic Classic 2","platforms":[{"id":6,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}],"screenshots":[{"id":661726,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sce6la.jpg"},{"id":661727,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sce6lb.jpg"},{"id":661728,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sce6lc.jpg"},{"id":661729,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sce6ld.jpg"},{"id":661730,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sce6le.jpg"}],"summary":"Sonic Classic 2 is a 2D fangame that is a sequel to Sonic Classic by Hez which will include:\n\nBrand New Levels\n4 playable characters (Sonic, Tails, Knuckles, and Fang)\nNew unique gimmicks\nCustomizable shields\nSC1 revamped levels\nOnline Play\nExtras & More!","tags":[1,268435464,536872916,536874296,536895036],"videos":[{"id":55866,"video_id":"IH2pFIMK6A8"}]},{"id":170266,"cover":{"id":178661,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co3tut.jpg"},"name":"Guy: By Hook or by Crook","platforms":[{"id":6,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}],"screenshots":[{"id":627474,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scdg5u.jpg"},{"id":627475,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scdg5v.jpg"},{"id":627476,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scdg5w.jpg"},{"id":627477,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scdg5x.jpg"}],"summary":"Guide Guy through his day, first by finding what to do, then hopefully and ultimately achieve the goal, by any mean necessary!","tags":[27,268435458,268435487]},{"id":108016,"cover":{"id":128284,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co2qzg.jpg"},"name":"Poltergeist Treasure","platforms":[{"id":3,"name":"Linux"},{"id":6,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}],"screenshots":[{"id":247653,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/gypdmwqngnzvbfprml0j.jpg"},{"id":247654,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/i6sek0ewq3drkjrqgzvd.jpg"},{"id":247655,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/ckdc5jmm8jjg0fdgaiur.jpg"},{"id":247656,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/rzxuotzehsqmrlgyucog.jpg"},{"id":247657,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/yikor4edqfmvsjrogqcd.jpg"}],"summary":"Poltergeist Treasure is an absurdist comedy point & click adventure game following Sir Typhil of Creulor as he attempts to escape a haunted forest.","tags":[27,268435487,268435488],"videos":[{"id":54587,"video_id":"RcYq_PGy-yE"}]},{"id":5599,"aggregated_rating":40.0,"cover":{"id":98789,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co2485.jpg"},"name":"Star Wars: Obi-Wan","platforms":[{"id":11,"name":"Xbox"}],"screenshots":[{"id":130991,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/jtwsmjov4ybucuekb8n1.jpg"}],"summary":"Join the legendary Jedi Knight Obi-Wan Kenobi as he takes on the worst scum and villainy the galaxy has to offer in level after level of fast-paced action.

The story takes place over three different campaigns and players take on the role of Soviet, Allied and German soldiers. Each campaign has its own scenario and structured timeline, which brings different elements of the war to life. \n \nThe game features hundreds of accurately modelled historical tanks and vehicles — including new designs of tanks, APCs and heavy guns — all of which are ready for your command. Dynamic in-game cutscenes enhance the single-player by telling the plot, without pulling the player out of the game experience. What's more, the sounds of war have been given a new lease of life, with more than 1,000 sounds effects of weapons and combat gear; all recorded under real operating conditions. \n \nThe single-player campaign also features a customisable user-interface, so players can have the command controls laid out in their own style. One of the biggest changes for Men of War is the inclusion of a comprehensive multiplayer, featuring new maps and modes, including Capture the Flag, High-Value Cargo and more.
