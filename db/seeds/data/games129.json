Starting at the back of the pack the objective is always to finish first on a linear course, overtaking the other bikers. This is achieved by driving very well or by playing it dirty, knocking opponents of their bikes using clubs, crowbars or your bare hands. The other racers fight back in a similar fashion and there are also hazards. All the races take place on the regular road with normal traffic (in both directions) and the cops, as well as occasional oil slicks and stray cows.\n\nBy winning races you can get promoted to a stronger division and earn cash with which you can buy a better bike. Whenever you're knocked off your bike or hit something you will have to run back to your bike and lose valuable time, plus your bike will suffer some damage. When the player crashes with cops nearby, it is possible to get busted and then you have to forfeit the race.\n\nLike the whole Road Rash lineage, the game has arcade-like gameplay with no intention to be a motorcycle simulation. While the game has a two-player mode, this is not simultaneous.","tags":[1,268435460,268435466,536870937,536870969,536873065,536874337,536874539,536875069,536875117,536875140,536875478,536875561,536875570,536875715,536875892,536876191,536877127,536877207,536877517,536877551,536877744,536878566,536879709,536880227,536880441,536884377]},{"id":48648,"cover":{"id":182261,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co3wmt.jpg"},"name":"Shatterhand","platforms":[{"id":18,"name":"Nintendo Entertainment System (NES)"}],"summary":"Imagine packing the power of 100 strategic missiles in every punch.

The difficulty adjusts precisely to the skill of the player over time, providing them with a consistent challenge. The goal of the game is to provide a challenging, yet casual experience that’s easy to pick up and put down.","tags":[1,18,268435461,268435464,268435488,536870915,536871882,536871937,536872961]},{"id":6595,"aggregated_rating":65.0,"cover":{"id":199243,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co49qj.jpg"},"name":"Sigma Star Saga","platforms":[{"id":24,"name":"Game Boy Advance"}],"screenshots":[{"id":172392,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/wlfqwjouwmqyuttcu4po.jpg"},{"id":172393,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/oweqbjvvijypm4z2rcte.jpg"},{"id":172394,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/vg62pal23mhpesmrj8yt.jpg"},{"id":172395,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/lbox3ru3ezxbmgg6plak.jpg"},{"id":172396,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/kgygdpfsikpufitkrito.jpg"},{"id":172397,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/qypkd0xsppcpufi7evjl.jpg"},{"id":172398,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/ijnj3dxgqymai5qzrnwp.jpg"},{"id":172399,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sffogufpsdliygusf4f4.jpg"}],"summary":"When a double-agent's allegiance begins to waver, the galaxy finds itself in a precarious position.\n\nHumanity is struggling to survive against the Krill onslaught.

Not an easy task on a strange new planet.","tags":[18,268435469,268435471,536873142,536874445],"videos":[{"id":13758,"video_id":"qORbw2jZM50"},{"id":15596,"video_id":"_apUOOScSc8"},{"id":18079,"video_id":"u3swV4JJKAc"}]},{"id":19197,"cover":{"id":46540,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/ozoh9grabriwwtcxjvar.jpg"},"name":"Majesty 2: Monster Kingdom","platforms":[{"id":6,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}],"screenshots":[{"id":469776,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sca2hc.jpg"},{"id":469780,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sca2hg.jpg"},{"id":469785,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sca2hl.jpg"},{"id":469787,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sca2hn.jpg"},{"id":469789,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sca2hp.jpg"},{"id":469790,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sca2hq.jpg"}],"summary":"New monsters, heroes and a campain in this extension for the original Majesty 2.","tags":[22,268435467,268435469,268435471,536871063,536871208,536871906,536872383,536874694,536876731]},{"id":152255,"aggregated_rating":83.0,"cover":{"id":162182,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co3h52.jpg"},"name":"Dodgeball Academia","platforms":[{"id":6,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"},{"id":48,"name":"PlayStation 4"},{"id":49,"name":"Xbox One"},{"id":130,"name":"Nintendo Switch"}],"screenshots":[{"id":489328,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scahkg.jpg"},{"id":489329,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scahkh.jpg"},{"id":489330,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scahki.jpg"}],"summary":"A sports RPG game featuring rookie dodgeball student, Otto.

Events may happen in-game that are not necessarily controlled or planned by the developer, which will help to create a dynamic developing experience for Bungie and a dynamic playing experience for gamers. The game's style has been described a first-person shooter that will incorporate massively multiplayer online game (MMO) elements, but Bungie has avoided defining Destiny as a traditional MMO game. Instead, the game has been referred to as a \"shared-world shooter,\" as it lacks many of the characteristics of a traditional MMO game. For instance, rather than players being able to see and interact with all other players in the game or on a particular server—as is the case in many conventional MMO games—Destiny will include on-the-fly matchmaking that will allow players to see and interact only with other players with whom they are \"matched\" by the game.\nDestiny will incorporate a new game engine that allows global illuminations and real-time dynamic lighting to occur together. An innovation in Bungie's \"hopper\" technology, which has been the backbone for Halo's matchmaking system, will allow better player matchmaking in order to create a more natural experience in either cooperative or competitive multiplayer modes.","tags":[1,18,39,268435461,268435468,536870915,536870928,536870934,536870937,536870981,536870982,536871044,536871094,536871123,536871332,536871365,536871390,536871452,536871475,536871487,536871496,536871504,536871784,536871859,536871882,536872009,536872010,536872205,536872232,536872245,536872611,536872647,536873154,536873874,536874743,536874822,536874947,536875046,536875106,536875157,536875173,536875196,536875199,536875242,536875265,536875271,536875275,536875300,536875309,536875311,536875312,536875314,536875356,536875358,536875363,536875372,536875406,536875464,536875483,536875484,536875500,536875525,536875572,536875610,536875680,536875708,536875738,536875743,536875755,536875766,536875781,536875782,536875784,536875790,536875794,536875795,536875796,536875797,536875798,536875800,536875801,536875803,536875804,536875807,536875813,536875814,536875819,536875830,536876191,536876218,536876220,536876221,536876227,536876228,536876229,536876235,536876255,536876262,536876273,536876370,536876528,536876537,536876580,536876612,536876853,536876927,536876974,536877032,536877111,536877153,536877158,536877165,536877252,536877258,536877286,536877288,536877319,536877382,536877400,536877455,536877493,536877521,536877647,536877950,536878064,536878101,536878117,536878309,536878372,536879234,536880043,536880073,536880160,536880224,536881260,536881544,536881831,536882402,536882753,536882754,536882755,536882756,536882757,536882758],"videos":[{"id":2189,"video_id":"RH3S0eZQeQw"},{"id":2344,"video_id":"j6YHtaccWlg"},{"id":6071,"video_id":"CdkCxnqD7Nk"},{"id":6072,"video_id":"SKwc_WSgrf0"},{"id":49385,"video_id":"jv7vqCmt6wY"}]},{"id":143331,"cover":{"id":130293,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co2sj9.jpg"},"name":"Negative: The Way of Shinobi","platforms":[{"id":6,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"},{"id":130,"name":"Nintendo Switch"}],"screenshots":[{"id":421444,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc916s.jpg"},{"id":421445,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc916t.jpg"},{"id":421446,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc916u.jpg"},{"id":421447,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc916v.jpg"},{"id":421448,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc916w.jpg"}],"summary":"Hardcore 2D platformer for skilled or stubborn players.  \nBecome a ninja prodigy, whose clan village was attacked by a mysterious sorcerer alongside the samurai army. \nUncover ninja skills, use stealth or head-on approach. \nReveal your father's secret intentions and stop the invasion.","tags":[1,23,268435464,268435487,268435488,268435489,536871029,536871076,536871955,536879148],"videos":[{"id":45385,"video_id":"rkwWHEKPJgk"}]},{"id":135801,"cover":{"id":110008,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co2cvs.jpg"},"name":"Tit Tap Tingle","platforms":[{"id":3,"name":"Linux"},{"id":6,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"},{"id":14,"name":"Mac"}],"screenshots":[{"id":393016,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc8f94.jpg"},{"id":393017,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc8f95.jpg"},{"id":393018,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc8f96.jpg"},{"id":393019,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc8f97.jpg"},{"id":393020,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc8f98.jpg"}],"summary":"A school field trip to the nearby beach island Chikubijima suddenly goes on lockdown due to some unknown circumstances in Japan and various other countries around the world, leaving TonTon University students and their professors stranded.

Each character has his/her own talents and skills. Escape from the prisons using stealth to hide from the guards or bribe your way with some and overpower others. \n \nFriedrich, a cruel dictator, controls his country's people with an iron fist. Now a band of rebels is about to stage a coup to overturn the dictator, but they are found out and thrown into prisons throughout the country. You must now re-unite your rebels and oust Friedrich. \n \nStarting off with one rebel you must infiltrate his prison and move through six different levels helping your comrades escape. Interact with the environment like throwing objects to distract the guards. Sneak past guards because they can hear your loud footsteps if you try to run. Watch out for his \"field of vision\" as you can tell where he is looking. If you knock a guard out he will eventually come to and look for you. If you kill a guard you must hide his body to keep from raising the alarm. \n \nEvery rebel has his/her own skills like feign death to surprise the guard and overcome him. Pick locks and set traps for unsuspecting guards. Conceal yourself in shadows to hide. Disguise yourself to fool the guards and even imitate sounds to throw them off your trail. And even cast Voodoo magic to hypnotize unwary opponents.","tags":[268435471,536874694,536877960]},{"id":44186,"cover":{"id":123629,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co2ne5.jpg"},"name":"Wrestling Revolution 3D","platforms":[{"id":6,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}],"screenshots":[{"id":109455,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/njql4rt6aexrlfjiuwwr.jpg"},{"id":109456,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/abupmyo0ibvr4n5mh2ik.jpg"},{"id":109457,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/szt0wiemvfod2dmf7phj.jpg"},{"id":109458,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/bmbwwjuvkmr8z0nv98xk.jpg"},{"id":109459,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/oh79p8ttl32x6k56lh72.jpg"}],"summary":"Wrestling Revolution 3D takes you either side of the curtain in one epic shared universe - where you can either take shots in the ring as a wrestler or call the shots backstage as a booker!","tags":[1,268435469,268435470,268435471,268435488,536871146,536871325,536875183,536875190,536879181]},{"id":148688,"cover":{"id":191277,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co43l9.jpg"},"name":"Infinity ZigZag","platforms":[{"id":6,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}],"screenshots":[{"id":460614,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc9veu.jpg"},{"id":460616,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc9vew.jpg"},{"id":460618,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc9vey.jpg"},{"id":460619,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc9vez.jpg"},{"id":460620,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc9vf0.jpg"}],"summary":"Infinity ZigZag is an arcade game where you need to change the direction of a circle moving along a zigzag corridor.","tags":[268435488]},{"id":18327,"cover":{"id":120116,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co2kok.jpg"},"name":"ZanZarah: The Hidden Portal","platforms":[{"id":6,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}],"screenshots":[{"id":82350,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/ym6i4joio1zfblyewipm.jpg"},{"id":82351,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/ucshwqurbmtgov26xpyv.jpg"},{"id":82352,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/qfxypnqnlupsggqqspwu.jpg"},{"id":82353,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/qspvln7bf9zd4pgjwr2k.jpg"},{"id":82354,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/qiwxdmkcbxs6lft31unc.jpg"}],"summary":"The legends speak of a long forgotten prophecy... of a shining hero and of perilous adventures... of sinister powers, strange worlds and swarms of fairies ... but they said nothing of a girl with a big heart instead of a big sword!","tags":[1,17,38,268435468,268435487]},{"id":21219,"aggregated_rating":80.0,"cover":{"id":189330,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co4236.jpg"},"name":"Steel Fury: Kharkov 1942","platforms":[{"id":6,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}],"screenshots":[{"id":28661,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/kk6ruymxces5ekvphyc1.jpg"}],"summary":"A historically accurate and realistic tank simulation.

Deception is the great equalizer as players will have to operate from the shadows to exploit every vulnerability - ruthlessly interrogate and brainwash enemies and allies alike to create double agents, saboteurs or unwitting collaborators. \n \nDevelop and defend your base of operations, recruit agents from the world’s many factions, and research new tech to give your operatives the advantage. Campaign missions deliver sprawling tactical encounters that revolve around two key pillars: stealth and explosive, all-out attacks. Your team of operatives can be deployed into the ﬁeld either fully armed or disguised as civilians, allowing them to inﬁltrate dangerous areas undetected at the expense of heavy weapons and armor. \n \nDecode and analyze your way through immersive investigations to expose far-reaching conspiracies and elusive targets. Delve into the oppressive dark corners of the volatile 1980s with atmospheric visuals and an unnerving soundtrack by award-winning composer Marcin Przybylowicz of The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt fame.","tags":[1,17,18,20,22,268435468,268435469,268435471,268435472,268435480,268435487,536870920,536871938,536874694,536874988,536875066,536875067,536875160,536876916],"videos":[{"id":15592,"video_id":"67QoLsVFFy8"},{"id":20417,"video_id":"4wmIGiirds0"},{"id":21159,"video_id":"1W6vC3Z6DfI"}]},{"id":17771,"cover":{"id":167485,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co3l8d.jpg"},"name":"Airport Simulator 2015","platforms":[{"id":6,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"},{"id":14,"name":"Mac"}],"screenshots":[{"id":92778,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/vgj1lf7gfjjykrele8au.jpg"},{"id":92779,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/trhkyhccjl8qnxuqiatc.jpg"},{"id":92780,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/pt22t7jz8walju9vzma8.jpg"},{"id":92781,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/zm7kgg3krauu6ecbopzf.jpg"},{"id":92782,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/gz4a8qwgcvi3x4ib9rnu.jpg"}],"summary":"Become the hero of the taxiway and step into the shoes of an airport employee in Airport Simulator 2015.

Each body part has its own attack and durability ratings that determines how the robot will fare in combat. \n \nThe battles takes place in the Coliseum. The Coliseum consists of a number of rooms each hosting an enemy robot that the player has to defeat to unlock more rooms. Defeating an enemy can also grant the player new body parts as well as experience and skill points. The player can move around his robot from a third person perspective and launch different attacks such as jabs, straight, hook and upper attacks. With good timing it's also possible to link attacks together. A special attack can be executed when the SP gauge is full. There's also a guard impact command which allows the player to repel the enemy attack. The player has a booster which allows the robot to fly as long as the boost gauge lasts.

ZUN stated that the Extra Stage in this game was meant to be an \"easy mode\" version; perhaps Phantasm Stage was the original Extra Stage during development.","tags":[1,17,268435461,536870990,536871029,536871078,536871138,536871208,536871823,536872225,536873476,536874055,536874259,536874277,536874278,536874398,536875158,536875472,536875941,536876634,536879840,536879841,536880987,536881920,536881921,536885063],"videos":[{"id":12114,"video_id":"Fsp0ESbQoCs"}]},{"id":106332,"aggregated_rating":70.0,"cover":{"id":172997,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co3phh.jpg"},"name":"Vagrus: The Riven Realms","platforms":[{"id":3,"name":"Linux"},{"id":6,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"},{"id":14,"name":"Mac"}],"screenshots":[{"id":240618,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/bphya6wgqnpmjitoy7yi.jpg"},{"id":240619,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/lfmiua7fqlmpi1lnuxfn.jpg"},{"id":240620,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/qcezqr6mj2wbg6yarwmb.jpg"},{"id":240621,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/ce8zdrrgrtdvvnkqi5xg.jpg"},{"id":240622,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/t0obm0wbnov0ut1cbtvz.jpg"},{"id":240623,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/iweecmxjnixspesclj76.jpg"},{"id":240624,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/tqmzdpttgbg2dj3lzv4d.jpg"},{"id":240626,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/m5xu5goxx4dda8c0wnmd.jpg"},{"id":240627,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/lbi8eyovvbsg1pv9nfzh.jpg"}],"summary":"Embark on a perilous journey across a realm forsaken by the gods and devastated by an arcane cataclysm.

The scenario objective is for each team to destroy the opponents' Ancient, heavily guarded structures at opposing corners of the map. Players use powerful units known as heroes, and are assisted by allied heroes and AI-controlled fighters. As in role-playing games, players level up their heroes and use gold to buy equipment during the mission. \n \nThe scenario was developed with the \"World Editor\" of Reign of Chaos, and was updated upon the release of its expansion, The Frozen Throne. There have been many variations of the original concept; the most popular being DotA Allstars, which eventually was simplified to DotA with the release of version 6.68. This specific scenario has been maintained by several authors during development, the latest of whom is the anonymous developer known as \"IceFrog\" who has developed the game since 2005. \n \nSince its original release, DotA has become a feature at several worldwide tournaments, including Blizzard Entertainment's BlizzCon and the Asian World Cyber Games, as well as the Cyberathlete Amateur and CyberEvolution leagues; in a 2008 article of video game industry website Gamasutra, the article's author claimed that DotA was probably \"the most popular and most-discussed free, non-supported game mod in the world\". DotA is largely attributed to being the most significant inspiration for the multiplayer online battle arena genre. Valve Corporation acquired the intellectual property rights to DotA to develop a stand-alone sequel, Dota 2, which was released in 2013.","tags":[1,268435468,268435480,536871004,536871060]},{"id":147851,"cover":{"id":204298,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co4dmy.jpg"},"name":"Desktop Basketball","platforms":[{"id":130,"name":"Nintendo Switch"}],"screenshots":[{"id":449258,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc9mne.jpg"},{"id":449261,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc9mnh.jpg"},{"id":449268,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc9mno.jpg"},{"id":449270,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc9mnq.jpg"},{"id":449271,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc9mnr.jpg"}],"summary":"Enjoy basketball with easy to learn controls!

Maybe it’s because we are too old to master Counter Strike, or because we suck at quick time events, but nevertheless, we think that this is the way it should be. \n \nEnd State has been under development as a hobbyist project already for a decade and has seen multiple revisions, each being more advanced and more fun than the previous one. While we are targeting a more hardcore audience, the game should still be accessible enough for anyone to learn. We sincerely hope that you’ll enjoy playing it as much as we do. \n \nGAMEPLAY \n \nTake command of a ragtag mercenary team with multiple characters with custom skill sets and weapons, facing a variety of enemies with different capabilities and weaknesses. Plan your moves in variable terrain that forces you to consider about character positioning. Directional facing matters and characters can peek around the corners. This is important because the “fog of war” only shows what the units actually see. \n \nUse cover for your benefit and aim your shots at specific body parts for different results. Face varying missions with different objectives ranging from planting a tracking device to releasing hostages and the enemy AI will, of course, act according to their separate motives. \n \nManage your team through a non-linear campaign. Recruit mercs, equip them and upgrade their skills as they gain more experience. The campaign is not linear, and in one playthrough you’ll never see everything the game has to offer. We aim to develop a future classic you can enjoy for years to come.","tags":[1,23,39,268435468,268435471,268435472,268435488,536871791],"videos":[{"id":29575,"video_id":"sky-FzyXIBs"}]},{"id":139565,"cover":{"id":117071,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co2ibz.jpg"},"name":"Castle on the Coast","platforms":[{"id":6,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"},{"id":48,"name":"PlayStation 4"},{"id":49,"name":"Xbox One"},{"id":130,"name":"Nintendo Switch"}],"screenshots":[{"id":403325,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc8n7h.jpg"},{"id":403326,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc8n7i.jpg"},{"id":403327,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc8n7j.jpg"},{"id":403328,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc8n7k.jpg"},{"id":403329,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc8n7l.jpg"},{"id":403330,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc8n7m.jpg"}],"summary":"A hand-drawn, retro 3D collectathon.
