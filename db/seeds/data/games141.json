Now Shrek finds himself amidst the kingdom\u0027s not-so-grand trash and must find a way to get rid of it.

Home computer ports were handled by Ocean Software; the 2003 PlayStation port was handled by Altron. An Apple IIgs port was completed in 1990, however was never commercially released (a leaked copy was however circulated). A clone for the PC, Brix, was released by Epic MegaGames in 1992. The Japanese arcade and FM Towns version has adult content during game play; a naked woman is revealed at the end of the level.\n\nPuzznic bears strong graphical and some gameplay similarities to Flipull/Plotting. An indie remake was made in 2009 for iPhone, called Gem Panic, and a range of Puzznic clones called \u0027Puzzle Magic\u0027 have appeared on mobiles. Many games share the same basic gameplay of Puzznic but have added extra features over the years:- Puzztrix on the web and on PC, Addled and Germinal on the iPhone, Puzzled on mobile phones.",

It\u0027s a strategic, maze-based video game franchise originally developed by Hudson Soft. \n \nMost games in the Bomberman franchise largely revolve around two modes of play; single player campaigns where the player must defeat enemies and reach an exit to progress through levels, and multiplayer modes where players must attempt to eliminate each other and be the last one standing. Gameplay involves strategically placing down bombs, which explode in multiple directions after a certain amount of time, in order to destroy obstacles and kill enemies and other players. The player can pick up various power-ups, giving them benefits such as larger explosions or the ability to place more bombs down at a time. The player is killed if they touch an enemy or get caught up in a bomb\u0027s explosion, including their own, requiring players to be cautious of their own bomb placement.",

    "summary": "Diabolik: The Original Sin is a gritty third-person adventure game blending the heritage of the pick-and-click genre with fast-paced action sequences and minigames.\n\nThe original idea of the game is based on the story created by the sisters Angela and Luciana Giussani in 1962 and its comic books. The adventure game is set in an unusual world made of a curious mix between 3D real time graphics and 2D black\u0026white comic style animation.\n\nThe traditional point-and-click genre has been perfectly adapted to the main features of the latest consoles in order to ease the developing of the main plot and minigames. The player is involved in a tricky story full of unexpected twists, intrigue, love and vengeance. In Diabolik’s skin, it won’t take too long to become a skilled thief and a master of disguise to rescue his beloved Eva.\n\nCalled to be the bad guy for once, the player will find himself ensnared in fast-paced combat and stealth sequences. Diabolik is a criminal who likes luxury, expensive cars and robs to enrich himself, following his own morality. Eva, the only woman who can keep up with him, likes being involved in mysterious and complicated stories. Diabolik and Eva make up an unconventional couple; they are lovers and partners in crime.",

The player maneuvers with 360 degrees of flight control through six levels. Weapons include fire-off lock-ons, rockets, multi-fire swarmers, and plasma cannons. The game has no multiplayer capabilities and does not feature DualShock or analog controller support. \n \nThere are no saving or loading features. Instead, a password is presented each time a level is completed. The game ends after its six levels are completed, or when the player\u0027s craft can no longer fly. This occurs if the craft takes heavy damage or the player ejects from their craft. The craft is teleported to base, repaired, and sent back to the stage for the first two times this happens; on the third time, the game ends. \n \nEnemies in the game vary from being tanks and aircraft to massive fixed gun emplacements and futuristic robots. In certain areas of the game, enemies continuously respawn to challenge the player until they swiftly complete the mission objective.",

As a pool of water that can take on alternate forms of ice and steam, you must overcome obstacles scattered across the pages of Aquaticus and save it from the corruptive Influence. Tilt and twist your Wii Remote controller to use the various forms and properties of water on your free-flowing journey through Aquaticus, where every page has multiple panels and illustrations that come to life. Tackle problems and defeat enemies to reveal magical Rainbow Drops, each of which will restore some of Aquaticus\u0027 power and allow it to open more chapters and grant you new powers. These additional powers, such as sticking to objects as a block of ice or shooting bolts of lightning as a steam cloud, will be essential to destroying the Influence and its minions. Along the way, you can also test your ingenuity and reflexes by finding hidden puzzle pieces. These pieces unlock playrooms that give you the opportunity to use the skills you\u0027ve learned and race against the clock to complete as many challenges as possible. These challenges won\u0027t affect your quest to restore Aquaticus\u0027 powers, but everyone needs a break now and again, right? Fluidity offers the chance to slosh and slide your way through an imaginative environment filled with challenging adventures. Are you ready to dive into this unique experience?",

    "summary": "Cossacks: European Wars is a real-time strategy computer game for Windows made by the Ukrainian developer GSC Game World. It was released on April 24, 2001. The game has an isometric view and is set in the 17th and 18th centuries of Europe. It features sixteen playable nations each with its own architectural styles, technologies and units. \nPlayers must avoid famine and engage in army expansion, building construction and simple resource gathering. Mission scenarios range from conflicts such as Thirty Years\u0027 War to the War of the Austrian Succession, and the game is renowned for the seemingly unlimited number of units players may control. This ability set it apart from other games of the time such as Age of Empires and Empire Earth. \nCossacks is a game which allows the user to gain strategy skills and even pick up some relative history of that period by the inclusion of a comprehensive encyclopedia. This top selling title has won two awards and was positively favoured by a majority of reviewers.",

There is also the option of enhancing the speed of the game, making the fights more intense but also more difficult to follow.\n\nIn addition to the main and versus modes, there is a story mode in which the Turtles must rescue April O\u0027Neil and Splinter from Karai\u0027s clutches. The Turtles must travel across the US in their Turtle Blimp, defeating other fighters and collecting information. Only the four of them can be playable whereas the other characters (as well as a turtle clone) are the opponents. There is no Mutagen Meter in story mode.

    "summary": "Set in Europe at the time of the migration of nations (about 200-450 AD), Against Rome takes the player to that part of the continent that has not yet succumbed to the Roman Empire. This vast territory, which the Romans disparagingly called barbaricum, is the home of numerous primitive nations. The player takes control over one of these barbarian tribes, who as a whole stood out for a pronounced lack of cultural achievements, combined with a ferocious belligerence. Skirmishes, raids and plunderings were the order of the day for these barbarians and are, therefore, the great theme of this game. \n \nBased in a small village, the player and his barbarians roam the vast forests of Germania or the barren steppes of eastern Europe to raid other settlements in their search for food, weapons and gold. These resources will help the barbarian chieftain expand his settlement and, above all, increase his reputation. While his tribe grows and flourishes, the leader obtains fame and experience and grows to be a master of warfare, until the player\u0027s barbarian empire is finally ready to take on the superpower of the time - the mighty Roman Empire and its apparently invincible army.",

He is one of the great pioneers of the icy climate and if I may say so, a survivor.\nHis game is collecting diamonds scattered in the coldest corners of the globe. Guide Mr. Penguin through each round and help him with his diamond collection.\nYou must collect all the diamonds and stash them safely in your igloo. Watch out! Those nasty seals have tusks as sharp as blades. If you can\u0027t crush them with a block of ice I suggest you dive out of their way.\nHang on! This is only round No. 1. Now let\u0027s try getting through to round No. 50. If you manage to get through all of that, how about constructing your own personal custom-tailored round. Good luck!",

The player explores a LEGO-based environment in an open world format: ride a skateboard, drive, fly and pilot a range of vehicles all whilst performing stunts and tricks while taking on the bad guy, Brickster. The player is cast as Pepper Roni, a lead stuntman in a big movie production set on LEGO Island.\n\nEven though the player is free to go wherever he wants, there is a story behind the game divided over 25 missions. All the missions are stunt-based. Running around the world in 3rd-person view, the controls are pretty basic and do not offer the trick combinations of other stunt/trick-based games. It is easy to pick up and play, even for the younger players, without worrying too much about what button combination will do what trick. Instead the player can focus on the missions by only having to complete basic tricks with a few button presses.",

The game, based on a sprawling comic book story arc of the same name, features numerous heroes, including Spider-Man, Venom, and their allies from the Marvel Comics fictional universe like Captain America, Black Cat, Iron Fist, Cloak and Dagger, Deathlok, Morbius and Firestar, all teaming up to battle an onslaught of villains led by Carnage, including Shriek, Doppelganger, Demogoblin and Carrion.\n\nBoth the Genesis/Mega Drive and Super NES versions come in a red cartridge. They were later released in the normal cartridge colors (black for Genesis, gray for Super NES).\n\nThe game was followed up by a sequel called Venom/Spider-Man: Separation Anxiety.\n\nUniversal Studios Orlando used Maximum Carnage as the theme for a haunted house at Halloween Horror Nights in 2002.",

The gameplay is largely identical to the original game, where items on a field need to be caught by timing correctly to extend a swinging claw and grab them. The main difference is that the gold miner is now in a cart that can be moved left and right, rather than using a fixed position. The game contains new levels, challenges and gadgets, and new characters, creatures and villains.",

In this case, it\u0027s JPBA member, Kyoko Sone.\n\nUnlike the prior installments in the Side Pocket series, Side Pocket 3 renders the pool room environment with 3D polygons. In spite of this, the table can still be viewed in a traditional, top-down fashion.\n\nPlay modes consist of: story mode, training mode, trick game mode, and versus mode. Game variants include: eight ball, nine ball, rotation, 14.1 continuous, bowlliards, cutthroat, three ball, poker, pocket game, mitsudama, and yotsudama.",

Ragen, a soldier in the House Davion army, was working to infiltrate and destroy a renegade mercenary cartel called the Dark Wing Lance. However, he was discovered, and the Dark Wing took their revenge: somehow, they had learned the location of the Ragen family\u0027s residence. Under cover of night they attacked, killing everyone. Only young Herras, who was at a friend\u0027s house at the time of the massacre, survived. Unbeknownst to him, the Dark Wing made an agreement that after the strike, they would separate for ten years and maintain an absolute code of secrecy before regrouping again to continue their nefarious operations. Now, in 3027, that time is up. Herras, who has become a young man, has waited the last decade for his chance to take revenge. As a mercenary MechWarrior operating from the planet Galatea, with a light \u0027Mech in the hangar and 50.000 C-Bills in the bank, he will accept any mission that will lead him closer to finding the murderers of his family.",

    "summary": "PES 2014 was being developed with six key elements in mind, that will define the physics and the features of the game. PES 2014 will center everything on the ball: how it moves, and how players use it. Physics of the ball, stature of the player, speed and height of the pass, everything will be taken into account to recreate the most realistic football experience on a home system. Players will be an important part of the game with Motion Animation Stability System (M.A.S.S.), that will increase the realism of physical contacts between players, tackles and decisions taken on the pitch by the AI to have more open games. The audience will have an influence on the performance of the team. On the pitch, the performance of an individual player, good or bad, will also have an effect on the team, giving them a moral boost if he has a moment of individual brilliance; or forcing his teammates to support him if he is not doing well. \n\nIntroduced in PES 2013, the Player ID system recreated faithfully the movements and skills of about 50 star players. In PES 2014, that number is increased and will also apply to complete squads to replicate a team\u0027s playing style. With the new Combination Plan, users will be able set up a variety of different tactics in key areas of the pitch using three or more players. These players will make very different runs to exploit holes in the defense or midfield, using the flanks, curved runs, or overlapping play to make themselves available.\n\nNew for this year, players can now change teams in the Master League and coach a national side. Players are also able to create 3rd and 4th kits. Some third and fourth kits are official. The PS2 version has the same characteristics of the other versions. UEFA Europa League also appears as a single-mode.",

It was described as \"a fast-paced, science fiction action-role-playing game in which the player battled across alien worlds to save the galaxy from the mutated forces of Darkspore\". In addition to the creature editor, the game featured a unique squad-based mechanic, various multiplayer options, and a player versus player arena. The game was released in North America on April 26, 2011 for Microsoft Windows, and in Europe on April 28, 2011.\nEA seemingly has removed the store page of Darkspore from Steam, meaning any attempt to purchase it through Steam cannot be made. The game was later relisted with EA saying that they would continue to support for the game. Those who have purchased it prior to the page\u0027s removal still have the game and could play it until the servers were shut down permanently on March 1, 2016. The game is currently unplayable due to its DRM scheme requiring a connection.",

The game has an extended Master League, with 2 divisions and eight more clubs, resulting in a total of twenty four club teams, such as Leeds United and Boca Juniors. More international teams have been added as well. Next to these additions, the gameplay has changed, as it is smoother and more realistic. The Japanese version of the game contains Under-23 National Teams as well, such as Australia\u0027s Under-23 National Football Team, which are not present in the Europe versions of the game too.",

As the game moves to other computers, it is quickly becoming the best-selling 3-D animated adventure game in history.\n\nLike it\u0027s predecessors, King\u0027s Quest III breaks new ground in the development of adventure games as an art form. \"Questbusters- The Adventurers\u0027 Journal\" praises the \"several exceptional innovations introduced in King\u0027s Quest III\" including the addition of pull-down menus, special self-mapping features and an advanced parser.\n\nKing\u0027s Quest III also breaks new ground in the area of puzzles and plot. The complexity of the storyline, and the intricate game puzzles, make for a game that will challenge even the most experienced adventurer. Subplots include an escape from slavery, piracy on the high seas, and the mastery of powerful magic.\n\nKing\u0027s Quest III is a graphics extravaganza with plenty of color, animation and quick screen changes. The locations and characters of King\u0027s Quest III are the most lifelike and interactive to date. The soundtrack, which includes well-choreographed music and funny sound effects, adds new dimensions to the viewer\u0027s enjoyment. In fact King\u0027s Quest III was nominated for \"Best Music in Computer Software\" by the Software Publisher\u0027s Association.\n\nThe most fun you can have playing computer adventure games! In 1983 Roberta Williams and her team of programming artists designed the original King\u0027s Quest playing system. Four years later, King\u0027s Quest games are still the most enjoyable adventure games available.\n\nRoberta Williams is designer of the King\u0027s Quest series. Over the last half decade, Roberta has worked closely with The Walt Disney Company and Jim Henson in the development of computer software. Her games have sold more copies than any other woman in computer software history.",

Utilizing a special cartridge with a built-in a sun sensor, the amount of sunlight outside the game determines how much sunlight shows up in the actual adventure. And since the player\u0027s gun is actually fueled by sunlight, the more sunlight you can get the stronger and more capable you are in the game.",

    "summary": "Sonic Riders: Zero Gravity is a hoverboard racing video game developed by Sonic Team and published by Sega for the PlayStation 2 and Wii. It is the fifth racing game in the Sonic the Hedgehog series, and the second entry the Sonic Riders trilogy. A port for the Xbox 360 was cancelled during development, while a sequel, Sonic Free Riders, was released exclusively for that system in 2010. \n \nGameplay in Zero Gravity is largely similar to its predecessor, with characters racing on different types of hovercraft called \"Extreme Gear\". In addition to the mechanics from the previous game, Zero Gravity adds a new gameplay system based around gravity that replaces the predecessor\u0027s \"fuel\" system. During the race, performing tricks and other actions will increase a character\u0027s Gravity Points, or GP. If players have accrued enough GP by the time they enter certain areas of the track, they will enter a Zero-Gravity Zone, where they can perform one of two maneuvers. A Gravity Dive will create a small black hole that points gravity forward down the track, giving the player a powerful free-fall boost that is further augmented by striking objects in the vicinity that the hole displaces, such as cars or signs. Alternatively, Gravity Control will alter the gravity of the course, allowing players to reach otherwise-inaccessible areas and shortcuts. Players can also use Gravity Drift to more easily maneuver around sharp corners.",
