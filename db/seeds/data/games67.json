    "summary": "The year is 1988. People have been going missing in a sleepy New England town--and by all accounts, they have been for years. All signs point to an old estate in the woods that the locals call Harrow Manor. Can you find out what happened? And more importantly, can you get out alive?\n\nSecret of Harrow Manor was created because I wanted to make a VR game in the survival horror genre that put you up against zombies and monsters in a creepy abandoned mansion setting similar to the games that inspired me so deeply when I was growing up. One where even an individual zombie was to be feared, and you needed to search the area for ammo and keys in order to make it out. Along the way you\u0027ll also find many documents to read that will slowly reveal the story of what happened at this mansion and what created the monsters in the first place.",

Supaplex introduces a number of new elements that were not present in Boulder Dash, including bugs, pieces of base that randomly cause a life threatening electrostatic discharges, Ports, which limit Murphy\u0027s movement to specific directions, and terminals, which set off yellow Utility Disks. \n\nUtility Disks are explosive floppy disks and come in three different colors: Orange Disks work like Zonks, but explode when hit or when falling. Yellow Disks do not fall yet may be pushed in any direction, and explode when the Terminal is used. Red Disks can be carried and dropped when convenient, exploding seconds after.",

NASA are trying to put a man on the moon but in a remote corner of Siberia, a Soviet cosmonaut is heading in the other direction. Ivan Ivanovich is dropped into an extinct volcano in his exploration capsule, Little Orpheus, to explore the centre of the earth.\n\nIvan vanishes, emerging three years later claiming to have saved the world. In a top-secret bunker, he is debriefed by the fearsome General Yurkovoi. Little Orpheus casts players as Ivan as he recounts an adventure beyond belief: a tale of lost civilizations, undersea kingdoms, and prehistoric jungles deep below the Earth’s crust.\n\nBrought to you in glorious technicolour with visuals inspired by a bygone era of adventure, Little Orpheus is a serialised adventure inspired by classic movies like Flash Gordon, Sinbad and The Land That Time Forgot.",

In the Aldus solar system, spaceflight has been regained. Two different races, the Malus and the Alyssians, both venture out into space for the first time and encounter one another. Due to fragmented legends among both races, they soon grow distrustful of one another and declare war. However the Alyssians and Malus are weak in resources, having been confined to their planets for so long, and so it\u0027s important for both sides to establish Offworld Resource Bases.\n\nO.R.B. is a 3D real-time strategy game, similar in gameplay to Homeworld. The player must build up bases and oversee the collection of resources in space. These can then be used to construct new vessels and spaceships as well as research additional abilities. Asteroids and planets can provide a strategic advantage in the positioning of forces. The player can assign movement and combat orders to individual units or as a group.",

Let\u0027s say there’re dozens of on-screen enemies to unleash this firepower on, and as your reward for dispatching them you get experience and gold to collect that can be used for character customization and new equipment--all the while playing alongside friends in 4-player cooperative play! If you like the sound of all this, then you\u0027ll love God Mode. \n\n\nRetro shooter action and RPG elements are combined in this new downloadable third-person shooter. God Mode combines non-linear gameplay, fast and frantic shooting, hordes of on-screen enemies, a fully functional online coop mode, and features visuals and gameplay that rival that of a full-priced boxed title. Matches rarely--if ever--play out the same, as dozens of in-game modifiers can significantly alter the gameplay on the fly. Characters are fully customizable, both in appearance and equipment, which continually evolve. Gold and experience are constantly accrued and used to unlock new and satisfying weaponry and unique powerful abilities, both of which can be further upgraded.Key Features:Cooperative multiplayer for up to 4 players (with special PvP locations)\nCollect gold and experience to unlock upgradable weapons and abilities\nExtensive character customization\nDozens of Tests of Faith (in-game modifiers) dynamically alter gameplay in each level",

It is Compile\u0027s last recognized Puyo Puyo title in the series before Sega obtained the rights.\nPuyo Puyo Box, being a compilation, primarily consists of modes from earlier Puyo Puyo games, but also contains original content.\n\nThis game has a plethora of game modes available to the user. It contains ports of \"Puyo Puyo\" and \"Puyo Puyo 2\", as well as a RPG-styled quest mode in which the player plays as Arle and battles against members of the other cast in Puyo Puyo matches. It also houses a \"Stage Clear\" mode in which you have to face either 10, 20, or 30 opponents, as well as two multiplayer modes which can be played with either other players or AI substitutes.\n\nFor the Quest mode itself, it allowed the player to customize the armory in ways in which made Arle stronger with a double-edged sword effect. You could remove the Puyo Rings in order to beef up her attack at the expense of being unable to see your next pieces for example, and the amount of experience gained and gold won was relative to how big a chain was scored and how quickly the opponent was defeated.\n\nThe key point in the Puyo Puyo gameplay of Box is that the player can choose a ruleset from either \"Puyo Puyo\", \"Puyo Puyo 2\", \"Puyo Puyo Sun\" and \"Puyo Puyo~n\". This can effectively lead to 4-player battles where each player plays with independent or mixed rules. This game also allowed for team battles to take place. A special multiplayer mode was made available in this game, known as \"Treasure Mode\", which was adapted in \"Puyo Puyo! 15th Anniversary\" as its \"Excavation Mode\".",

Ultimately, your goal is to find a home and raise your own family.\n\nYour quest begins on the slopes of Amethyst Mountain and eventually takes you across the Lamar Valley to Slough Creek. There, you and your mate will establish a territory and raise a litter of pups: training them, feeding them, defending them against predators, and finally taking them on a cross-country journey to a summer home. Ultimately, your success will depend on your ability to ensure the survival of your pack.\n\nPlay the game alone or with friends in on-line multiplayer missions, which now feature the complete pup-raising mission arc. Private multiplayer games feature text and voice chat. Both private and public games have phrase chat.",

The Soundtrack for the Amiga Version was composed by Chris Huelsbeck\n\nRock \u0027n\u0027 Roll is an action-oriented puzzle game with 32 levels (plus a secret bonus level). The player controls a ball (steered with the mouse on the Amiga or the joystick on the Commodore 64) and his job is to reach the exit on each level.\n\nNumerous objects help or hinder the player\u0027s path to the exit. These include locked doors that he needs to find a key to, ice which hinders his steering, fans that push him away or magnets that pull him towards them, crumbling floor tiles, and others. A map of the level is accessible at any time, but it starts out completely blank. The player has to collect eyes along the level to make various objects visible on the map. He may also buy various supplies like a fastball, a spikeball, bombs, and even hints for game secrets like extra money, extra lives and short cuts.\n\nThe name \"Rock \u0027n\u0027 Roll\" comes from both the aspect of \"rolling\" your ball along the level, and the various catchy Rock and roll-inspired tunes that play as the background music.",

How you take a turn, or whether you choose to ski over the moguls or choose a landlocked course around them, are all bits of strategy that can move you to the front of the pack, or send you to last place depending on your skill.\n\nYou can either compete in the official “Race” mode, or enter the “Practice” mode which lets you improve your skills on any of the eight different tracks.\n\nGame controls are all keyboard based. Up Arrow to accelerate, Right Arrow to turn to the right, Left Arrow to turn to the left. Brake or Stop just by lifting your finger off the accelerator key. Options are available to modify your point of view (3rd person far, 3rd person close-up, and 1st person), resolution (up to 640x480), and level of detail (low, medium, or high).

It released for Microsoft Windows, Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 in October 2010. \n \nThe game is set in a post-apocalyptic, open world environment around the area of Nevada, California, and Arizona. The player takes control of the character known as Courier 6, who, preceding the start of the game, is hired by a delivery service called the Mojave Express to take an unknown package across the Mojave Desert to the New Vegas Strip. The game starts during the delivery, where the Courier is intercepted, shot in the head, and left for dead by a mysterious man who steals the package. After being found by a friendly robot, Victor, and healed by a man named Doc Mitchell, the Courier is thrust back into the desert to seek revenge and recover the stolen package. By doing this, the player becomes caught between various factions competing for control over the desert and its most valuable asset, the Hoover Dam, ultimately coming to shape the future of its inhabitants. \n \nEven though it directly succeeds Fallout 3 in order of Fallout game releases, offers a similar action role-playing experience, and shares its engine and legacy content with Fallout 3, New Vegas is not a direct sequel. It marks the return of some elements found in Fallout 2. The game was a critical and commercial success, shipping more than 5 million copies altogether. Electronic Entertainment Design and Research, a market research firm, estimates that the game has sold almost 12 million copies worldwide.",
