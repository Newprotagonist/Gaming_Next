The objective of the game is to fight off the members of the Scorpions and confront the true culprit, a rival martial artist named Anderson. A second player can now join in anytime via the use of a Game Link Cable, taking control of Billy's brother, Jimmy.\n\nThe combat system is simpler compared to previous Double Dragon games, including the first Game Boy game. The player can perform a series of punches or a kick on most enemies, followed by straight punch or a high kick that knocks the enemy to the floor. Pressing the A and B buttons simultaneously will cause the player to kneel. While kneeling, pressing either button will cause the player to perform an aerial uppercut. Instead of the hair grab from previous games, the player will do a collar grab (similar to Renegade), in which the player can repeatedly punch his opponent in the face or push them to the ground. While standing near a fallen enemy, a jumping knee drop can be performed. Despite the presence of armed enemies, the player cannot disarm them and pick up their weapons like in other games in the series.\n\nThe game is composed of three missions, spread across ten stages. The first two missions each consist of four stages that follows a basic structure: the player fight their way through a street until reaching the boss. This is followed by a subway platform, a fight inside a subway car, and the destination platform, where the player confronts another boss. The final mission, composed of only two stages, starts at the streets again, but this time the player must fight his way to the entrance of the Scorpions headquarters. Once inside the building, the player fight their way through a series of floors, including an area where all the previous bosses appear, until reaching the top floor where Anderson awaits. The game has three difficulty settings, but the Easy setting only allows the first mission to be played.","tags":[1,268435460,268435481,268435489,536896720,536897343,536898949,536898950,536901615,536902082],"videos":[{"id":47791,"video_id":"gf9EwVNk_Co"},{"id":47792,"video_id":"I3UpESY9X88"}]},{"id":98985,"cover":{"id":85936,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co1ub4.jpg"},"name":"Truth: Disorder II","platforms":[{"id":3,"name":"Linux"},{"id":6,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"},{"id":14,"name":"Mac"}],"screenshots":[{"id":231533,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/wp7b6nlp4p8kcgnvehdl.jpg"},{"id":231534,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/xz7fm8xlufhjgq7aidtp.jpg"},{"id":231537,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sag1wicsoe2wiv6uum89.jpg"}],"summary":"Continuation of the favorite of many visual novels Truth: Disorder.

The upgraded hardware of the Sega Y Board allows individual sprites and the background to be rotated–even while being scaled–making the visuals more dynamic.\n\nDesigned and directed by Yu Suzuki, the game was a critical and commercial success upon release in arcades. It was subsequently ported to various home computers in Europe by Activision in 1989, followed by a PC Engine port published in Japan by Asmik Ace in 1990. It was not released on Sega consoles until the Sega Ages release for the Sega Saturn in 1998.","tags":[1,268435466,268435489,536871192,536871501,536871969,536872590,536872695,536874337,536875069,536875075,536875117,536875350,536875437,536875453,536875942,536877097,536878436,536884429,536889526],"videos":[{"id":63393,"video_id":"fHwU5JrvcIg"}]},{"id":84603,"cover":{"id":61945,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/bo7zlwda6y0ztoxczz6q.jpg"},"name":"Molly Maggot","platforms":[{"id":41,"name":"Wii U"}],"screenshots":[{"id":165945,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/dhc3duryizptnwdk9utu.jpg"},{"id":165946,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/dz1bclcizs89hkcmqf1a.jpg"},{"id":165947,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/ryi3mnstirdmnlxpgqzn.jpg"},{"id":165948,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/zjrj9vxjr40chkriweiy.jpg"},{"id":165949,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/lrkss6yhb6hstwoscjya.jpg"},{"id":165950,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/ofiroqihbtjaqu6ychds.jpg"}],"summary":"Become the maggot.","tags":[1,268435487]},{"id":178264,"cover":{"id":193036,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co44y4.jpg"},"name":"Bad End Theater","platforms":[{"id":3,"name":"Linux"},{"id":6,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"},{"id":14,"name":"Mac"}],"screenshots":[{"id":672017,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sceej5.jpg"},{"id":672018,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sceej6.jpg"},{"id":672019,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sceej7.jpg"},{"id":672020,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sceej8.jpg"},{"id":672021,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sceej9.jpg"},{"id":672022,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sceeja.jpg"}],"summary":"Welcome to Bad End Theater!

In this turn-based strategic simulation you must choose a team of four of these from the 8 available, and take them to victory in five increasingly tough missions. Even before you get into the main gameplay, there is a lot of strategy involved in choosing weaponry, as they make different amounts of noise when used (reducing the stealth potential) and their ammunition is of varying weight.\n\nIn each turn you have limited action points per soldier, which must be used for all movement, firing and reloading moves. The maps are viewed isometrically, with a compass used to indicate the directions of movement, and where the incoming fire emanated from.","tags":[39,268435468,268435471,268435472,268435480,536871307,536874694],"videos":[{"id":25615,"video_id":"X03YswqGszg"}]},{"id":153040,"cover":{"id":195056,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co46i8.jpg"},"name":"Trap Adventure","platforms":[{"id":6,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}],"screenshots":[{"id":494733,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scalql.jpg"},{"id":494736,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scalqo.jpg"},{"id":494741,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scalqt.jpg"},{"id":494742,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scalqu.jpg"},{"id":494745,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scalqx.jpg"}],"summary":"\"Trap Dungeon\" is an old-schoold 2.5 roguelite game about an escape from dangerous dungeon.

However, there is also a novice mode available with the usual division between a shoot and pass button. Another important option is the dribbling (novice or expert) which sets how well the ball sticks to the controlled athlete. Before starting a match, there are also some limited tactical options available (choosing the formation and switching the position of athletes around).\n\nIn contrast to the computer versions there are no pre-set tournaments, but the player can start two tournaments with customizable requirements: cup or league. The cup allows to set the number of rounds (one to four) and some rules can be switched on or off for each round individually (number of legs, extra time, penalties). The league on the other hand has the options number of teams (between one and seven), how often the teams face each other (between once and four times) and if a win rewards two or three points. The pitch type (normal, dry, wet, icy, hard or random) can be set in both modes. There are twenty national and twenty club teams (all with slightly changed original names) to choose from. General options are the game length (between three and seven minutes) as well as switching weather on or off.","tags":[32,268435470,536870938,536870939,536871951,536898318],"videos":[{"id":53937,"video_id":"Yl9XiSnKd_I"}]},{"id":96904,"name":"Semi-Sweet Tofu","platforms":[{"id":6,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}],"screenshots":[{"id":232875,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/vtvfmnn2q3wsises4ljz.jpg"},{"id":232878,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/bdabe7xslatqfpgqxe7i.jpg"}],"summary":"Semi-Sweet Tofu is a 2D side scrolling platformer game where players have to eat fruit to survive along with using the color you change while eating the fruit to defeat the enemies you are faced with.
