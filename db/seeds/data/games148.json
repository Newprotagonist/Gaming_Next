The game was developed by Vicarious Visions and published by THQ.\n\nJet Grind Radio is an action platform game based on the Dreamcast version. The gameplay of Jet Set Radio differs in several key areas from its Dreamcast counterpart. Instead of being a 3D game using polygons, the game is a 2D game with an isometric viewpoint. The goal of the game is to traverse through neighborhoods and find key locations to tag them with graffiti under a specific time frame. Players can grind on rails and perform tricks. When a key location is reached, players must tag it with graffiti that may require a single press of a button, or a sequence of buttons that need to be pressed at the correct time. The game offers a graffiti editor to customize and create unique graffiti tags. Players can collect hidden icons scattered throughout in order to expand the number of graffiti tags. After completing the story mode of a specific neighborhood, three new time attack modes are unlocked for that neighborhood. The three modes involve tagging an entire city, racing, and performing tricks. Jet Grind Radio also offers 4-player multiplayer that allows players to compete within the unlocked time attack modes.","tags":[1,268435464,536871081,536872331,536873352,536874992,536877099,536879336,536888436,536888787,536893470,536898773,536898774,536898775,536898776],"videos":[{"id":47238,"video_id":"9WW8W-y_nuE"}]},{"id":166250,"cover":{"id":175773,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co3rml.jpg"},"name":"Smashing the Battle: Ghost Soul - Limited Edition","platforms":[{"id":48,"name":"PlayStation 4"},{"id":130,"name":"Nintendo Switch"}],"screenshots":[{"id":602179,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sccwn7.jpg"},{"id":602180,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sccwn8.jpg"},{"id":602181,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sccwn9.jpg"},{"id":602182,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sccwna.jpg"},{"id":602183,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sccwnb.jpg"},{"id":602184,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sccwnc.jpg"},{"id":602185,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sccwnd.jpg"},{"id":602186,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sccwne.jpg"}],"summary":"This edition includes the following\nSmashing the Battle: Ghost Soul Collector’s Box\nSmashing the Battle: Ghost Soul Game (region free)\nSmashing the Battle: Ghost Soul Manual\nSmashing the Battle: Ghost Soul Original Soundtrack\nSmashing the Battle: Ghost Soul Numbered Certificate\n\nONLY 2000 LIMITED EDITIONS MANUFACTURED\n\nGet ready for a hack-and-slash action experience filled with bots, babes and a whole lot of bounce!

Test your mettle and see if you have what it takes to beat a collection of levels created by other famous game developers.\n\nInspired by classic 8-bit days gone-by and now with experience-heightening 3D, VVVVVV will challenge even the most battle-hardened old-school gamers.","tags":[1,18,268435464,268435465,268435487,268435488,268435489,536870928,536870984,536871029,536871038,536871049,536871354,536871389,536871456,536871470,536871803,536871806,536871878,536871882,536872070,536872617,536872862,536872898,536872961,536873904,536874209,536875046,536875050,536875075,536875081,536875142,536875168,536875197,536875200,536875326,536875377,536875396,536875453,536875456,536875521,536875531,536875621,536875638,536875688,536875689,536875702,536875753,536875851,536875902,536875917,536875942,536876174,536876222,536876353,536876354,536876436,536876634,536876960,536877456,536877629,536877677,536877679,536879127,536879148,536879691,536880158],"videos":[{"id":11535,"video_id":"sf06P-_1lkU"}]},{"id":36332,"cover":{"id":173815,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co3q47.jpg"},"name":"Nicolas Eymerich The Inquisitor Book II: The Village","platforms":[{"id":6,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"},{"id":14,"name":"Mac"}],"screenshots":[{"id":105912,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/yzsv2vfs9tzccmgj5ebx.jpg"},{"id":105913,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/djpl5e420zi9jgteoqxb.jpg"},{"id":105914,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/srfnvrjfsxxm21sw77yu.jpg"},{"id":105915,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/jnx5emjm0jznym1w2p3h.jpg"},{"id":105916,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/dfb23hfvguvr9dy1dyvf.jpg"}],"summary":"Evil and heresy have invaded Calcarès, but that is without counting on the inquisitor and his uncompromising methods for foiling the fiendish plans threatening the village.","tags":[268435487]},{"id":32817,"cover":{"id":141762,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co31du.jpg"},"name":"Mr. Pumpkin Adventure","platforms":[{"id":6,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"},{"id":14,"name":"Mac"},{"id":41,"name":"Wii U"},{"id":46,"name":"PlayStation Vita"},{"id":49,"name":"Xbox One"}],"screenshots":[{"id":53545,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/u6tfkmmxvaobpim01lmn.jpg"},{"id":53546,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/nqouakystyroebbded12.jpg"},{"id":53547,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/rgustrkfdbjfu4oolzea.jpg"},{"id":53548,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/g68we7ywtjjdg1pyr2sj.jpg"},{"id":53549,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/fhgyd7awcsfbut66cbb5.jpg"},{"id":166311,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/pgcnsoq9ilvo78bx1c1c.jpg"},{"id":166312,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/l6wdsgwdax6r0vgudchr.jpg"},{"id":166313,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/bzvhcfu4p7dhhblqkpzo.jpg"},{"id":166314,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/ocrsvvqcp25wucad3jhw.jpg"},{"id":166315,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/khwt9newpdiyt9kigitn.jpg"},{"id":166316,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/rzyrrpyq9pge7b6ozh2r.jpg"}],"summary":"Mr. Pumpkin's Adventure is a point-and-click puzzle game.

Pushmo World finds players pushing, pulling and climbing blocks to solve a collection of more than 250 new puzzles. What separates Pushmo World from the other games in the series, besides the crisp and colorful HD graphics and original puzzles, is the addition of World Pushmo Fair, an in-game hub that gives players an easy way to share and download new puzzles. \n \nIn Pushmo World, players are tasked with solving three-dimensional block-based puzzles by moving blocks to climb to the top of structures. As the game progresses, the puzzles get larger and more complex, with some massive, screen-filling creations resembling familiar objects, animals and even classic Nintendo characters. Pushmo World introduces a collection of training levels that players can use to hone their puzzle-climbing skills. The game also features a time-rewind option that lets players undo mistakes. This forgiving feature rewards players for being smart thinkers, rather than forcing them to restart a complex puzzle for making a hasty move. Being stumped won’t stop the fun: If players are stuck on a particularly tough puzzle, they can skip ahead to the next one. In addition to the numerous puzzles included in the game, Pushmo World lets players create their own puzzles using a selection of tools in Pushmo Studio and share them with friends and others around the world.","tags":[268435464,268435465,268435471,536873787,536875046,536875092,536875212,536875273,536875629,536875754,536875823,536875901,536876541,536877082],"videos":[{"id":11732,"video_id":"0noVqmZKYAY"},{"id":11733,"video_id":"Vm7qYpklhNg"}]},{"id":147938,"cover":{"id":204890,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co4e3e.jpg"},"name":"Animal Pairs - Matching & Concentration Game for Toddlers & Kids","platforms":[{"id":130,"name":"Nintendo Switch"}],"screenshots":[{"id":449828,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc9n38.jpg"},{"id":449830,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc9n3a.jpg"},{"id":449832,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc9n3c.jpg"},{"id":449834,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc9n3e.jpg"},{"id":449836,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc9n3g.jpg"}],"summary":"In this classic pair matching game players must flip over cards to reveal matching pairs of two.

Gradius II has kept the gameplay from the original game, but infused it with enhancements brought from the spin-off, Salamander (Life Force). This is primarily evident in two of the weapons configurations that are selectable. Another first in the series was the inclusion of the \"boss rush\" (also known as \"boss parade\" or \"boss alley\"), a level designed entirely with only boss confrontations.\n\nGradius II retains the selection bar from Gradius, but now the player can choose between four different weapon configurations and progressions. All schemes have speed-up and multiples (Options), but have differing 'Missile', 'Double' (laser), and 'Laser' weapons. The player can have at most four multiples. Additionally, there are also two types of shielding to choose from: shield and forcefield. The shield option adds more durability, but only for the front of the Vic Viper, while the forcefield adds protection for the entire spacecraft, albeit only against three hits. In the Famicom version, choosing another multiple after four will make the four multiples to move around the spacecraft for 16 seconds; force field is the only shielding available for protection of the entire spacecraft, withstanding three hits and it is included in four different weapon configurations and progressions; and 'Double' and 'Laser' have to be activated twice to achieve full performance.","tags":[1,18,268435461,268435489,536871078,536871470,536871882,536871971,536872482,536872983,536873064,536874743,536875076,536875158,536875309,536875396,536875434,536875689,536875765,536875809,536876120,536876232,536876348,536876349,536876391,536876449,536876455,536876634,536876635,536877072,536877435,536877744,536879712,536879765,536879840,536880042,536880077,536880080,536880217,536880311,536880906,536884846]},{"id":1381,"aggregated_rating":72.5,"cover":{"id":77764,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co1o04.jpg"},"name":"PAYDAY: The Heist","platforms":[{"id":6,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"},{"id":9,"name":"PlayStation 3"}],"screenshots":[{"id":1954,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/bh68u5xamd6m9bjgbzbc.jpg"},{"id":1955,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/aznzg4hxzgpvxtaj8m0i.jpg"},{"id":1956,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/ih3gnb75tmnpece9nm01.jpg"},{"id":1957,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/d1alpqiofvvt1p3ti7qz.jpg"},{"id":1958,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/aazazvd1iifcildtphya.jpg"}],"summary":"PAYDAY: The Heist is an action filled first person shooter that lets players take on the role of a hardened career criminal executing intense, dynamic heists in constant pursuit of the next “big score”.

It also bridges the gap between the two films, explaining why Nightcrawler is not present for The Last Stand, and also introduces new foes to the X-Men film canon, such as HYDRA, who FOX didn't own the film rights to. The only further reference to HYDRA in the X-Men film series would be the appearance of Bob, Agent of HYDRA in Deadpool, though the character's ties to HYDRA are not referenced. The game was released on the PlayStation 2, Xbox, Xbox 360, developed by Z-Axis; Nintendo GameCube, ported by Hypnos; Microsoft Windows, ported by Beenox; Game Boy Advance, developed by WayForward Technologies; and Nintendo DS, developed by Amaze Entertainment.","tags":[1,268435481,536870926,536871213,536871487,536871506,536871580,536871633,536871894,536872098,536872205,536872234,536872352,536872898,536873299,536874398,536874745,536875046,536875054,536875073,536875265,536875271,536875294,536875329,536875437,536875585,536875689,536875717,536875736,536875778,536875803,536875868,536875917,536876266,536876296,536876471,536876694,536876695,536876724,536876760,536876762,536876813,536876944,536876999,536877009,536877175,536877275,536877452,536877494,536877565,536877672,536877945,536878516,536879053,536879198,536879205,536879582,536880360,536880386,536880958,536880994,536882033,536882507,536883757,536884018],"videos":[{"id":46200,"video_id":"YGm1MK_T5UQ"}]},{"id":159009,"cover":{"id":161229,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co3gel.jpg"},"name":"The Rebellion","platforms":[{"id":6,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}],"screenshots":[{"id":550160,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scbsi8.jpg"},{"id":550161,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scbsi9.jpg"}],"summary":"The Rebellion is a bold new take on real-time strategy that enables you to command from above and also seamlessly transition to 3rd person to join your warriors on the battlefield.

Each turn, a player takes control of a single squad member in a third-person perspective to move around the map, including jumping over terrain and swimming over bodies of water, yet can only engage in combat when stationary. Each turn has a set time limit and ends if the timer counts down to zero, the player skips their turn, a weapon or ability is used or if they have accidentally injured themselves such as walking into a mine field or falling from a high surface. Other hazards include bodies of water that, while they can be swam in, is damaging to nearly all types of soldiers and drains health as they swim. If a teammate is knocked into water by an opponent, they will automatically swim to the nearby shore line. While difficult, it is also possible to knock hogs off the map resulting in instant death. If all health is gone and the player is on land, they will fall over with a last comical remark before exploding.","tags":[1,27,39,268435471,268435472,268435480,536870913,536870941,536871213,536871262,536871327,536871510,536872019,536872211,536872348,536872666,536874694,536874706,536874743,536875074,536875095,536875099,536875125,536875159,536875160,536875171,536875199,536875202,536875244,536875271,536875305,536875315,536875322,536875358,536875362,536875437,536875448,536875531,536875822,536876262,536876273,536876281,536876318,536876389,536876687,536876767,536877309,536878464],"videos":[{"id":4015,"video_id":"ARVH2gt6q5s"}]},{"id":198551,"cover":{"id":220046,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co4pse.jpg"},"name":"Underdog Detective","platforms":[{"id":6,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"},{"id":14,"name":"Mac"}],"screenshots":[{"id":781071,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scgqof.jpg"},{"id":781072,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scgqog.jpg"},{"id":781073,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scgqoh.jpg"},{"id":781074,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scgqoi.jpg"},{"id":781075,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scgqoj.jpg"},{"id":781076,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scgqok.jpg"}],"summary":"Underdog Detective is a video-based playable, interactive story Set in the reign of Empress Wu Zetian of ancient China, you will play as a slum dweller in the imperial capital of Luoyang and embark on a thrilling yet comedic adventure!

He's on holiday from school and wants to find the treasure buried in his carrot patch. He has six relatives each of which has a clue so, with the help of the pupil, off he goes. Each visit is in two parts, for example visiting Granny in the frozen north starts with a request to click on all the items beginning with a specific letter to defrost them. There's usually around half a dozen items on the ground of which four match the specified criteria. Once this task has been completed the pupil goes to an ice hockey practice session. Here a letter is shown on the scoreboard and hockey pucks with three and four letter words are slid over the ice. If the initial letter of the word matches the target letter the pupil clicks on the puck and, if they're right, it's fired into the net. If the initial letter does not match the target letter they click on the referee and the puck melts away. After completing the mini games the player is shown a clue to the carrot patch treasure, this specifies a letter. The player is then taken to the carrot patch where they must identify the letter from those shown, they click on it, a tunnel is dug to that spot where there will be an object and a small animation. Different games stress different reading elements. Alfie the Jazz Hamster asks the pupil to choose words that rhyme, Grandad gets the pupil to match upper and lower case letters, Flash asks the pupil to spell/complete words that come from a volcano while Robbie at the ranch expects pupils to decide whether a word is real of not.","tags":[34,35,268435465,268435487]},{"id":135792,"cover":{"id":109958,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co2cue.jpg"},"name":"Work Trip","platforms":[{"id":6,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"},{"id":130,"name":"Nintendo Switch"}],"screenshots":[{"id":392904,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc8f60.jpg"},{"id":392905,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc8f61.jpg"},{"id":392906,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc8f62.jpg"},{"id":392907,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc8f63.jpg"},{"id":392908,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc8f64.jpg"}],"summary":"Fun, relaxing and easy low poly adventure through different zones with fun quests, secrets and achievements.","tags":[268435464,268435469,268435487,268435488,536870984,536871063,536872996,536874472,536874475],"videos":[{"id":38563,"video_id":"Ej6Lz0vuTl8"}]},{"id":194465,"cover":{"id":213244,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co4kjg.jpg"},"name":"Techtonica","platforms":[{"id":6,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}],"screenshots":[{"id":757666,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scg8ma.jpg"},{"id":757667,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scg8mb.jpg"},{"id":757668,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scg8mc.jpg"},{"id":757669,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scg8md.jpg"},{"id":757670,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scg8me.jpg"}],"summary":"Techtonica is a first-person factory building game set beneath the surface of an alien planet.

Being released after Petz 5, it is part of the second Petz series. Hamsterz Life lets you raise several breeds of hamsters and build fully customizable homes for them to live in. Just as in the other Petz games, players can interact with their hamsters by training, playing with, and feeding them. \n \nAt the start of the game, players can select their first hamster and name it. The hamster will then appear in a cage and be ready to play. Various actions can be chosen including training, feeding, care and other options. Training consists of teaching the hamster words (which they repeat back in their own hamster speak) by speaking the set phrases into the DS microphone. The hamster can repeat these phrases back, but inaudibly. Players can clean the cage and brush their hamsters. Hamsterz Life also includes many mini-games to play. Players can only have one hamster at home at once, any other hamsters that are owned are left with a girl with hamster ears until you wish to switch. Your hamsters can visit with the hamsters of friends who also own Hamsterz Life. When playing mini-games, if you win you receive prizes such as food or toys. You can also let your hamster out of its cage to play in the surrounding room. There are present boxes in the room, which contain prizes you receive when your hamster finds them.","tags":[268435469,536871186,536871728,536871901,536875240,536876908]},{"id":130698,"cover":{"id":107929,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co2ba1.jpg"},"name":"Takeshi and Hiroshi","platforms":[{"id":14,"name":"Mac"},{"id":39,"name":"iOS"},{"id":130,"name":"Nintendo Switch"}],"screenshots":[{"id":390505,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc8dbd.jpg"},{"id":390506,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc8dbe.jpg"},{"id":390507,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc8dbf.jpg"}],"summary":"\"Takeshi and Hiroshi\" combines the two worlds of puppet animation and Role Playing Game.
