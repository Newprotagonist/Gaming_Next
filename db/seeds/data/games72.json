The story envisions a fictional world dreamed by Chopin during his last hours that is influenced by Chopin's life and music, and in which he himself is a playable character, among others. The game's battle system centers on musical elements and character-unique special attacks. Light and darkness play a part in the appearance and abilities of enemies on the battlefield, as well as the types of magic that can be cast.\n\nThe game features a selection of Chopin's compositions played by pianist Stanislav Bunin, though the original compositions were composed and arranged by Motoi Sakuraba. It is notable for its use of classical piano pieces, educational cutscenes featuring real paintings and photographs (in contrast to the cel-shading graphics of the game) and lush landscape design.","tags":[268435468,536870990,536871138,536871139,536871183,536871186,536871208,536871327,536871470,536871535,536871784,536871938,536872093,536872098,536872120,536872205,536872371,536872647,536872746,536872964,536873082,536873154,536873384,536873878,536874398,536874745,536875042,536875057,536875095,536875122,536875157,536875178,536875196,536875265,536875300,536875304,536875356,536875358,536875380,536875419,536875436,536875449,536875455,536875523,536875590,536875621,536875637,536875639,536875695,536875699,536875764,536875791,536875792,536875830,536875870,536875903,536875923,536875934,536875952,536875954,536876007,536876054,536876067,536876232,536876241,536876243,536876266,536876285,536876316,536876333,536876375,536876495,536876551,536876650,536876666,536876695,536876762,536876849,536876974,536877305,536877402,536877406,536877438,536877560,536877617,536878024,536878078,536878312,536878363,536878572,536878604,536880476,536880968,536883988,536883995,536884486],"videos":[{"id":10048,"video_id":"EPIthYJXZxI"}]},{"id":111165,"cover":{"id":68948,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co1h78.jpg"},"name":"SKATEBOARD PARK TYCOON: BACK IN THE USA 2004","platforms":[{"id":6,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}],"screenshots":[{"id":257981,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc5j25.jpg"},{"id":257982,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc5j26.jpg"}],"tags":[536870962,536873825]},{"id":143877,"cover":{"id":132021,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co2tv9.jpg"},"name":"GoB 2020","platforms":[{"id":6,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}],"screenshots":[{"id":423716,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc92xw.jpg"},{"id":423717,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc92xx.jpg"},{"id":423718,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc92xy.jpg"},{"id":423719,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc92xz.jpg"},{"id":423720,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc92y0.jpg"},{"id":423721,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc92y1.jpg"}],"summary":"A free character-based multiplayer FPS.

The game sold poorly but received very positive reviews from critics.","tags":[1,268435464,268435465,536871208,536871213,536871487,536872257,536872961,536873787,536875042,536875073,536875079,536875361,536886222],"videos":[{"id":7709,"video_id":"eLwbripbgm0"}]},{"id":139917,"cover":{"id":131238,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co2t9i.jpg"},"name":"Outriders: Day One Edition","platforms":[{"id":48,"name":"PlayStation 4"},{"id":49,"name":"Xbox One"},{"id":167,"name":"PlayStation 5"}],"screenshots":[{"id":417183,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc8xwf.jpg"},{"id":417184,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc8xwg.jpg"},{"id":417185,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc8xwh.jpg"},{"id":417186,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc8xwi.jpg"},{"id":417187,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc8xwj.jpg"}],"summary":"The DAY ONE EDITION includes: \n- OUTRIDERS Game \n- The Hell’s Rangers Male and Female Gear Sets. \n- The Hell’s Rangers Arsenal of 11 unique Guns. \n- The Hell’s Rangers Truck Mods and Decals.","tags":[1,18,268435461,268435468],"videos":[{"id":44327,"video_id":"TiwOS45F_v8"},{"id":44328,"video_id":"gzRocxoettU"},{"id":44329,"video_id":"lVB98xP6gds"}]},{"id":23827,"aggregated_rating":80.0,"cover":{"id":112296,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co2enc.jpg"},"name":"God of War Saga","platforms":[{"id":9,"name":"PlayStation 3"}],"screenshots":[{"id":42618,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/pf5zjysrswamezkv9ewz.jpg"},{"id":42619,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/wet6rq9y3mjvteuuhdhw.jpg"},{"id":42620,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/uv0kokwqliubaamarhlv.jpg"},{"id":42621,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/kssjx1nght6wmmt9c26m.jpg"},{"id":42622,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/v2njgo7qkyts7sphg0y8.jpg"}],"summary":"The God of War Saga is a collection of five games from the God of War series, and is one of the first in Sony's new line of PlayStation Collections. \n \n- God of War \n- God of War II \n- God of War III \n- God of War: Chains of Olympus \n- God of War: Ghost of Sparta","tags":[1,17,22,268435481,268435487,536870947,536871139,536871208,536871535,536871872,536871945,536872014,536872626,536872953,536873384,536873473,536873863,536875067,536875081,536875131,536875157,536875199,536875265,536875281,536875298,536875327,536875331,536875526,536875571,536875671,536875830,536876057,536876058,536876212,536876220,536876235,536876538,536876607,536876650,536876901,536876979,536877014,536877049,536877598,536877628,536877764,536877829,536877987,536878133,536878263,536878354,536878453,536878502,536878553,536879588,536879917,536880638,536880671,536880691,536881271,536881704,536881955,536881956,536881957,536881958,536881959,536881960,536881961,536881962,536881963,536881964,536881965,536881966,536881967,536881968],"videos":[{"id":13583,"video_id":"Hf2adVqQn3g"}]},{"id":119111,"cover":{"id":74631,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co1ll3.jpg"},"name":"Irkalla","platforms":[{"id":3,"name":"Linux"},{"id":6,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"},{"id":14,"name":"Mac"}],"screenshots":[{"id":306838,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc6kra.jpg"},{"id":306839,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc6krb.jpg"}],"tags":[1,18,268435461,268435488,536871761,536872617,536874451],"videos":[{"id":27551,"video_id":"1U8Lm6Fq43w"},{"id":27552,"video_id":"mgPfAIgU5LA"},{"id":27553,"video_id":"dsRiP0SGJrU"}]},{"id":141060,"aggregated_rating":84.0,"cover":{"id":120060,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co2kn0.jpg"},"name":"Serious Sam Collection","platforms":[{"id":48,"name":"PlayStation 4"},{"id":49,"name":"Xbox One"},{"id":130,"name":"Nintendo Switch"},{"id":170,"name":"Google Stadia"}],"screenshots":[{"id":416325,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc8x8l.jpg"},{"id":416326,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc8x8m.jpg"},{"id":416327,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc8x8n.jpg"}],"summary":"Step into the shoes of the legendary action hero Sam \"Serious\" Stone and experience one of the most explosive shooter game series of all time, as you save the world from a merciless alien invasion.","tags":[1,268435461,268435487],"videos":[{"id":42949,"video_id":"wWG0VbEocag"},{"id":42950,"video_id":"SdFvwAJXbPo"}]},{"id":30386,"cover":{"id":185057,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co3ysh.jpg"},"name":"Sacra Terra: Kiss of Death -

The soccer in this game, however, has several differences than the real soccer, such as the ability to tackle other players with a minimal penalty, using Mario-themed items to give players an advantage over their opponents, and playing with stage hazards effectively. This game places a higher emphasis on individual character attributes compared to its precedent, by not only assigning stats, but by also giving team captains a unique Super Ability and the Mega Strike, an opportunity to score up to six goals. Another introduced mechanic is the power level of the ball: indicated by the color of the glow, the shots of the ball become more quick and powerful the more active it is, thus making it easier to score goals with.","tags":[1,268435470,536870928,536870938,536871208,536872078,536872232,536872293,536872594,536872637,536873064,536873077,536873186,536873671,536875091,536875236,536875262,536875271,536875350,536875433,536875569,536875659,536875713,536875752,536875825,536875924,536876055,536876083,536876106,536876259,536876435,536876639,536876756,536876927,536877052,536877055,536877066,536877069,536877070,536877071,536877090,536877098,536877104,536877106,536877116,536877280,536877432,536877706,536877710,536878090,536878112,536878125,536878153,536879791,536879987,536880251,536880441,536880839,536882290,536882828,536883573,536883995,536885522],"videos":[{"id":35957,"video_id":"XBinxNwAN5s"},{"id":35958,"video_id":"J_MWHeuO-6g"},{"id":35959,"video_id":"ezqDwJ4evOM"}]},{"id":147980,"name":"Six Sides of the World Enhanced","platforms":[{"id":130,"name":"Nintendo Switch"}],"screenshots":[{"id":450099,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc9nar.jpg"},{"id":450100,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc9nas.jpg"},{"id":450101,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc9nat.jpg"},{"id":450102,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc9nau.jpg"},{"id":450103,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc9nav.jpg"}],"summary":"“Six Sides of the World” is a puzzle video game that takes you into an intergalactic journey through different star systems riddled with brain-racking challenges.","tags":[1,40,268435465]},{"id":117957,"cover":{"id":112790,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co2f12.jpg"},"name":"Not Not -

They were released on as Perfect Sun, Missing Moon, and Wandering Star for the PlayStation Portable as a port of The Idolmaster.\nThe gameplay in SP features changes from its predecessor, including an additional promise system which puts more of a focus on communication.\n\nThe games include three game modes: two single-player and one multiplayer mode for up to three players. The story is told from the perspective of a producer in charge of training 10 prospective pop idols on their way to stardom, and each version of SP features different idols.

years ago during the great disaster Naglfar Night, a shift in the Earth’s crust caused the land to be inundated by the sea, washing away the soil and drastically altering the world. A great tear in the crust known as the ‘parallel out’ emitted noxious gases which hardened the skin of humans, causing them to crumble into dust. This spelled the end of tens of thousands of people. \n \nThose that were not affected moved away from the capital, which was ravaged by the disaster, to rebuild.

Who would want to play against him? In the case of Fritz 16, however, playing against an engine is now once again the very definition of fun! A host of features, including \"Assisted Analysis\", which gives you discreet visual hints as you move, and emoticons, which show Fritz’s mood, are there to help you.

The name originates from the fact that you'll often have to \"dodge\" around the pieces of your opponent to advance your own. \n \nThis conversion places Vout's abstract board game in a science fiction setting with an added time limit, playing in a space station which is about make fatal contact with an asteroid. Your goal is to evacuate all your shuttles or landers in time, while preventing your opponent to do the same before you. \n \nThe game is played on a simple square board, with players taking turns moving one token to a neighboring square at each turn. It is not allowed to move onto an occupied square or backwards, only in the direction of the evacuation pads (up for shuttles, right for landers) or sideways. That's it. The amazing thing is that these primitive rules produce quite a devilish game, where you have to try to block your enemy pieces, while taking care not to be blocked yourself. (Another slight modification has been taken: you are not allowed move in a way to make your opponent unable to move; in the original game, an immobile player won.","tags":[268435465]},{"id":140448,"cover":{"id":118884,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co2jqc.jpg"},"name":"Apex Legends: Season 7","platforms":[{"id":6,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"},{"id":48,"name":"PlayStation 4"},{"id":49,"name":"Xbox One"}],"screenshots":[{"id":405907,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc8p77.jpg"},{"id":406473,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc8pmx.jpg"},{"id":406474,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc8pmy.jpg"}],"summary":"Olympus awaits in Apex Legends Season 7 – Ascension.

It is a variation on their browser game Candy Crush.\n\nDifferent \"special candies\" can be formed by matching a combination of 4 or 5 in a certain formation, such as a \"Striped\" candy (which clears either an entire row or column), a \"Wrapped\" candy (which acts like a bomb; clearing the 8 surrounding candies, falling, and exploding one more time), or a \"Color Bomb\" (which removes all candies with the same color of the one it is matched with). Special Candies can also be matched together, producing varying effects; for example, matching a color bomb with a striped candy turns all of the candies of its color into striped candies, which are immediately detonated.\n\nOther special candies which appear on the boards for free can be purchased from the in-game store, or won from the Candy Crush Booster Wheel. These include Jelly Fish in jelly clearing boards which clear 3 pieces from the board at random, the Coconut Wheel on ingredient dropping boards which changes three candies in a row into striped candies, and Lucky Candy in recipe boards which when matched change to one of the types of pieces the player needs to clear the objective. The Booster Wheel also offers a chance to win a jackpot of all boosters in one spin.\n\nOther pieces known as Blockers appear on boards to add to the challenge: Icing (also called Meringues) cannot be moved and can only be removed by matching next to it, Liquorice Locks cage of single pieces of candy to prevent them from use, Chocolate pieces will multiply if not cleared, Liquorice Swirls cannot be removed with Special Candies, Candy Bombs will explode and end the level early if they are not cleared, Multilayered Icing requires multiple matches to remove, Chocolate Spawners will produce Chocolate pieces at all times, Marmalade guards Special Candies from use, Cake Bombs can clear the entire board once cleared, and Toffee Tornadoes move on the board destroying pieces and shattering the tile beneath them to prevent use for one turn. Other pieces also appear on levels such as Chameleon Candies which switch colors every turn, Mystery Candies which randomly turn into a Special Candy or a Blocker, and Extra Time Candies on time limit levels.\n\nThe player can also purchase various Boosters to attempt to win levels more easily or extend play after a lost level; Lollipop Hammer clears a single piece from the board, Extra Moves can be purchased if running out of moves at the end of a game, Free Switch allows players to switch two pieces that do not possibly match, Sweet Teeth to clear out Blockers and Jelly, Bomb Coolers to add onto Candy Bomb timers if the timer runs out, and the Bubblegum Troll to stop Chocolate Spawners from spawning chocolate from its sides. The Dreamworld levels have their own special boosters: the Restore Balance booster to reset the Moon Scale for 5 turns and the Moon Struck booster to automatically activate Moon Struck.","tags":[268435465,268435471,268435489,536871013,536873787,536875046,536876500,536877609,536877610]},{"id":113526,"name":"Aliens Don't Exist","platforms":[{"id":3,"name":"Linux"},{"id":6,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}],"screenshots":[{"id":275052,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc5w8c.jpg"},{"id":275053,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc5w8d.jpg"},{"id":275054,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc5w8e.jpg"},{"id":275055,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc5w8f.jpg"},{"id":275056,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc5w8g.jpg"},{"id":275057,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc5w8h.jpg"}],"summary":"The road of adventure sometimes leads to a dead end.

Because of these methodological differences, the two styles have vied time and again for supremacy. \n \nAlthough practitioners of Waijia were far greater in number, in the end not one of them could stand up to a warrior who had truly mastered the secrets of Neijia. For centuries, this was the unchallenged law of the martial arts world. However, the advent of cybernetics changed everything. Freed from the yoke of their physical limitations, Waijia schools discovered an entirely new world of possibility. The Neijia schools that had reigned over the martial world with their secret techniques, suddenly found themselves obsolete. \n \nIn this age where technology is changing the face of combat, heirs to the ancient martial traditions have developed anti-cyborg techniques for the sole purpose of defeating cyborgs with one's bare hands - at great cost to the wielder. \n \nKong Taoluo, one such master and former asssassin in the Qingyun Society, returns to Shanghai from a year in recovery after being betrayed by the syndicate and assumed dead. Discovering the horrible truth of what has happened to his sister during his absence; Taoluo swears an oath of vengeance and sets out to murder those responsible. \n \nAn updated release titled 'Kikokugai -Reichin Rinrinshan-' was released in 2011, with voices, vertical text, redone script, and redone art.","tags":[268435487,536871939,536873308,536875172],"videos":[{"id":39831,"video_id":"jSg2B4C43LA"}]},{"id":131716,"name":"Minicraft Deluxe","platforms":[{"id":6,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"},{"id":14,"name":"Mac"}],"summary":"Minicraft deluxe is a version of the game Minicraft that was developed and released in 2012.

It was released only in Japan and was also the only one in the series not to feature a Pac-Man game. \nThe limited edition comes in a large box designed to hold all 6 Namco Museum releases as well as a memory card. \n \nIt features 7 titles: \n \n- Dragon Saber (1990): A vertical scrolling shooter arcade game that was released by Namco in 1990. It is the sequel to Dragon Spirit, released 3 years earlier. \nSTORY: The human beings have repeated their own foolish history, because of their own desires. And everything around then has amounted to come to nothing. Advanced alchemy has caused environmental disruption. The world has been filled with evil creatures. And the human beings have threatened with extinction. Meanwhile, the sun god, Amaterasu appeared from the sky to human, and told. \"The brave young man Huey and Siria. I grant you this sacred saber.\" \"Show your good spirit!\" \n \n- Wonder Momo (1987): A beat 'em up arcade game that was released exclusively in Japan by Namco in 1987. It runs on Namco System 86 hardware, and was later ported to the PC-Engine in 1989. It is Namco's last 8-bit arcade game. This game was never released outside of Japan, probably because of its slightly questionable content. Momo is a young girl who gets super-powers, hence becoming Wonder Momo and battling costumed villains. \n \n- Rompers (1989): an arcade game that was released by Namco in 1989 only in Japan. It runs on Namco System 1 hardware. \nYou control a guy wearing a straw hat named Chap who must collect all of the keys in 61 maze-like gardens while avoiding various enemies to rescue his girlfriend, Rumina. He can push the walls over to crush the enemies, but they will come back as eggs which will hatch after a few seconds. There is also a strict time limit to ensure you don't dawdle. \n \n- Motos (1985): An arcade game that was released by Namco in 1985. It runs on Namco Super Pac-Man hardware but with a video system like that used in Mappy. It has 62 levels. \nThe player must maneuver a bumper car to bump enemies off the edge of the playfield while they attempt to do the same to it. Power-ups give the car extra bumping power and the ability to jump over gaps in the playfield. \n \n- Sky Kid (1985): A horizontal scrolling shooter arcade game that was released by Namco in 1985. It runs on Namco Pac-Land hardware but with a video system like that used in Dragon Buster. It is also the first game from Namco to allow 2 players to play simultaneously. The game was later released on the Famicom (brought to the American NES by Sunsoft), and this version was released on Nintendo's Virtual Console service in North America on May 19, 2008 at a cost of 500 Wii Points. A sequel named Sky Kid Deluxe was released in 1986. It introduced several new enemies and missions. \nThe players play as the Sky Kids \"Red Baron\" and \"Blue Max\", which are references to Manfred von Richthofen, the famous World War I flying ace, and the prestigious order Pour le Mérite, informally known as Blue Max. The Sky Kids fly around in biplanes and are assigned specific targets during the missions. These missions involve bombing specific targets. \n \n- King & Balloon (1980): A fixed shooter arcade game that was released by Namco in 1980. It runs on Namco Galaxian hardware but with an extra Z80 processor to drive a DAC for speech; the King speaks when he is captured (\"HELP!\"), when he is rescued (\"Thank you\"), and when he is carried away (\"BYE BYE!\"). Additionally, the balloons make the same \"droning\" sound as the ships in Galaxian, which was released the previous year. The player's shots also have the same sound effect as the player ship in said game. \nThe player controls two green men (likely soldiers in the king's army) with an orange cannon that fires at squads of descending balloons. You must protect the king and prevent him from being captured and carried away by one of the balloons. \n \n- Rolling Thunder (1986): A run and gun arcade game that was released by Namco in 1986.

Discover the grand mystery behind the strange island that you wake up on.

Fuchsia uses its unique music and art style to create an atmosphere not only of mystery and intrigue, but also of hilarity and absurdity. \n \nThe game's puzzles, just like the atmosphere, exude uniqueness. While they will, no doubt, at times leave the player thinking long and hard, the puzzles are always fair and sensible. They are easy enough for any player to be capable of solving them with enough time, yet difficult enough for every player to feel satisfied at every point of progression. \n \nFuchsia takes place in three distinct sections (or \"chapters\"), and takes approximately one to two hours to complete. Completion time will, of course, vary based on how long the player takes to solve each puzzle. \n \nThis is our first game ever, so we really hope you enjoy it!

The players take on the role of the eponymous Black Rock Shooter. The game is divided up into several missions in which the player must clear objectives to progress. On the main overworld, BRS can explore the available areas and look for certain items. Battle begins when the player comes into contact with an enemy on the overworld. During battle, BRS can aim and shoot with her rock cannon at enemies, block against attacks and sidestep to avoid them completely. If the player fires the rock cannon or uses the sidestep too much in a short time, the system will overheat, leaving the player vulnerable to attack until it cools down. Throughout the game, players can earn abilities that can be equipped to BRS and used in battle, each with their own cooldown periods. These include offensive attacks such as a powerful blast, a sniper rifle, or support abilities that can increase BRS' stats such as her attack or defense. Certain sections will also see BRS ride a motorcycle, in which she can attack enemies on either side of her or use weapons to fire in front of enemies.","tags":[1,268435466,268435468,536871809,536871843,536871937,536888363,536891244,536891480,536891481],"videos":[{"id":5326,"video_id":"5C3RURPgLfs"},{"id":5327,"video_id":"YktBu0lswP4"},{"id":5328,"video_id":"IA1z_HGFP3U"}]},{"id":15200,"cover":{"id":13448,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/ifdf1jfhpgupt5m5kaxr.jpg"},"name":"Clash of Kings","platforms":[{"id":6,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"},{"id":34,"name":"Android"},{"id":39,"name":"iOS"}],"summary":"Clash of Kings is a fantasy themed real-time strategy game.
