It was later ported to the Atari Jaguar CD by High Voltage Software in 1995, where it was included alongside with Blue Lightning as one of the pack-in games for the peripheral when it launched. It is the first entry in the franchise of the same name. \n \nIn Vid Grid, the players have to resolve and finish a jigsaw puzzle in time as their main objective, before the music video that is being played on the background ends. Conceived by Geffen executive Norman Beil and produced in conjunction with Jasmine Multimedia as a joint-venture, the game was one of the first titles to use Microsoft's Video for Windows multimedia framework, which allowed to play and encode digital video up to a maximum resolution of 320x240 pixels. \n \nThe game includes a total of 10 music videos of different rock genres (including grunge rock from Soundgarden and Nirvana, hard rock from Van Halen and Aerosmith, and heavy metal from Ozzy Osbourne and Metallica). During each puzzle, the video itself is chopped up into a grid and each piece is scrambled. As the video plays, players must reassemble the pieces to its original form. As players progress through the game, each puzzle gets progressively tougher to solve (including larger amounts of pieces, different puzzle requirements, and flipped videos). \n \nThe game received two spin-off titles: Country Vid Grid (for country music videos) and Kid Vid Grid (for cartoons).","tags":[34,268435463,268435465,536872407,536873787,536875049,536875435,536876212,536878193],"videos":[{"id":47658,"video_id":"q81v-BjeBZY"}]},{"id":111974,"name":"Girls and Tests","platforms":[{"id":6,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}],"screenshots":[{"id":267182,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc5q5q.jpg"},{"id":267183,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc5q5r.jpg"},{"id":267184,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc5q5s.jpg"},{"id":267185,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc5q5t.jpg"},{"id":267186,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc5q5u.jpg"}],"summary":"Try to find out what Mariah and Sonya like!

It explains how the diabolical Emperor Geldoblame rose to power, and it also fills in many details about the heroes from the first title. In addition, players will learn about the origins of the world itself and why the Lost Ocean is returning. The hero, a blue-haired young man named Sagi, was sent to assassinate the Emperor but found the job had been done for him. Blamed for the death, he's now on the run with two friends - a robot named Guillo and a young woman named Milly. In the initial stages, the player's party will progress in a linear fashion, moving from one area to the next along a set path. After playing the game for a few hours, players will acquire a ship that lets them visit areas in the order of their choosing, allowing them to either pursue optional side quests or blast through the main mission as they see fit. Unlike traditional RPGs, where characters gain levels in categories such as strength and agility, the majority of leveling-up occurs by procuring better Magnus cards. There are more than 600 different Magnus cards in Baten Kaitos Origins, some of which have truly fantastical properties. Players can acquire cards in many different ways, including trading, buying, winning as spoils of war or by creating them themselves.","tags":[17,268435468,268435487,536871139,536871208,536871327,536871384,536871938,536871939,536872222,536872746,536874398,536874943,536875126,536875310,536875380,536875389,536875436,536875455,536875586,536875639,536875667,536876199,536876231,536876299,536876511,536876607,536876847,536878005,536878078,536878515,536880256,536880968,536884018,536885901,536887082],"videos":[{"id":59989,"video_id":"LkYyQQqMIIs"}]},{"id":29989,"name":"Magic Lantern","platforms":[{"id":6,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}],"screenshots":[{"id":102987,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/xur135y3pfgij2rlak2x.jpg"},{"id":102988,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/j7rbt41yoozdtrczs7au.jpg"},{"id":102989,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/uiqh4vcw83yybob0pqmv.jpg"},{"id":102990,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/i7cfmxx79ayma3osz18v.jpg"},{"id":102991,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/ddltdbhdtfpxbcmgjx5d.jpg"}],"summary":"Magic Lantern VR is a cozy virtual room for the whole family, where you can watch your favorite stories, play games, draw pictures, and generally have fun.

It was published by Electronic Arts and released for the Nintendo 64 on October 17, 2000, shortly before the release of its PlayStation counterpart. The game features a single-player campaign in which players assume the role of MI6 agent James Bond as he fights to stop a terrorist from triggering a nuclear meltdown in the waters of Istanbul. It includes a split-screen multiplayer mode where up to four players can compete in different types of deathmatch and objective-based games.\n\nThe game runs on an engine that was adapted to take advantage of the Nintendo 64 strengths. Although Eurocom used original production material to recreate the environments of the film, the company added elements to help the game design, including a mission which takes place in the London Underground. The game supports the Nintendo 64 Expansion Pak, which provides enhanced graphics and visual effects, but a Controller Pak is required to save the player's progress through the game.\n\nThe World Is Not Enough received generally positive reviews from critics and was frequently compared to Rare's Nintendo 64 first-person shooters GoldenEye 007 and Perfect Dark. It was also considered superior to its PlayStation counterpart because of its level design and inclusion of a multiplayer mode. Critics generally praised the game's graphics and smooth frame rate, but criticized its weak and inconsistent enemy artificial intelligence. In the United States, the game sold more than one million copies.","tags":[1,268435461,268435487,536871378,536872085,536881361,536897818,536898539],"videos":[{"id":46456,"video_id":"hSwyofrAZqY"}]},{"id":129436,"cover":{"id":121287,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co2ll3.jpg"},"name":"Bingo Hall","platforms":[{"id":6,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}],"screenshots":[{"id":365862,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc7uau.jpg"},{"id":365863,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc7uav.jpg"},{"id":365864,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc7uaw.jpg"},{"id":365865,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc7uax.jpg"},{"id":365866,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc7uay.jpg"},{"id":365867,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc7uaz.jpg"},{"id":365868,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc7ub0.jpg"},{"id":365869,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc7ub1.jpg"}],"summary":"Bingo Hall is a very fun and simple game to play with almost any number of people.

The games were developed by the same team who are responsible for the Street Fighter III series. \n \nIt was originally released in the arcade in 1998 on the CPS-3 arcade system; this version was known outside Japan as JoJo's Venture. An updated version of the game was released in 1999 as JoJo's Bizarre Adventure: Heritage for the Future (ジョジョの奇妙な冒険 未来への遺産 JoJo no Kimyō na Bōken Mirai e no Isan?), becoming the sixth and last game released for the CPS-3 board. Console ports for the PlayStation and Dreamcast were also released that year. A high-definition version of the game was released on PlayStation Network and Xbox Live Arcade in August 2012.[1] \n \nThe game combines Capcom's trademark anime-inspired graphics, as seen in the Darkstalkers series, with the colorful characters and events of Hirohiko Araki's creation, resulting in a highly stylized and detailed visual style. It also features many of the gameplay mechanics seen on previous Capcom fighting games, such as the use of power gauges for super moves, as well as a brand new Stand Mode, consisting of the series' signature guardian spirits that accompanies almost every character and can be summoned or dismissed at will by the player, resulting in variations in the character's move list and abilities. \n \nOriginal author Hirohiko Araki served as a consultant for the game and created exclusive pieces of artwork for its promotion and packaging; most notably, he developed from scratch a new character design for Midler, since Capcom was interested in using her in the game and she had been only vaguely shown in the original manga."},{"id":4783,"aggregated_rating":65.0,"cover":{"id":178471,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co3tpj.jpg"},"name":"Cursed Mountain","platforms":[{"id":5,"name":"Wii"},{"id":6,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}],"screenshots":[{"id":27128,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/xx4tequlrm4rksdqgdrs.jpg"},{"id":28141,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/oarpefqndczewfvsoz9j.jpg"},{"id":28142,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/r19z7jpxbs4o70191ygn.jpg"},{"id":28143,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sxryydnzdd7jozyo7t3c.jpg"},{"id":28144,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/frp0yz3xipw7othpny41.jpg"},{"id":155832,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/zrd7e61nqd0b1l6e3z1i.jpg"},{"id":155833,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/zcmahetktx316e215lyh.jpg"},{"id":155834,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/q5v0u00escwx7twjuaty.jpg"},{"id":155835,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/mnpsqmmwb6enkoqp9d4d.jpg"},{"id":155836,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/kwkfarcipkqiukdusulk.jpg"},{"id":155837,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/teuitjpxcyxstyr27uko.jpg"},{"id":155838,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/ulgfyqdasligs7lwvqzg.jpg"}],"summary":"After his brother, known for taking extreme risks, disappears in the Himalayas, Eric Simmons reluctantly heads off to the village of Lhando, his last known location.

The train tracks circulate those dispensers as they keep filling the inner field around them with balls. Matching 3 or more balls of the same color makes them disappear. If the spheres accumulate, a floating time bomb appears. Its detonation ends the game. \n \nSpecial balls with symbols are thrown randomly on the field. They act as a power-up when matched. Nuke balls explode surrounding balls. Haste balls temporally increase the train speed. Color bomb balls pop all spheres of the same color on the field. Time balls temporally stop the dispensers. \n \nA hollow pole with a factory whistle at the left-side of the screen slowly fills with each match. Matching spheres also gives extra ammunition for the weapons. The level ends when the bar is complete and the whistle blown. \n \nThe train movement is controlled by the keyboard and the cannon aiming and shooting by the mouse. Some levels have gates, balls or enemies on the tracks, stopping the train movement. Other levels have pinball slider tracks and bouncer springs. \n \nEnemies throw bombs that stop the train or the cannon from working. Most can be killed with one of the weapons, although some have to be color matched with a ball to be destroyed. \n \nThe weapons can be selected with the mouse wheel or pressing a number key. Besides the default ball-shooting cannon, there is a weapon with homing bees that wait for an enemy came out from hiding to attack it. The gun shoots a bullet that pops balls and kills vulnerable enemies. The laser cannon shoots a beam that destroys everything in its path. Tisha also can throw herself on balls and enemies, eliminating both in a kamikaze attack."},{"id":30307,"cover":{"id":102654,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co277i.jpg"},"name":"Market Tycoon","platforms":[{"id":6,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}],"screenshots":[{"id":103217,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/hpkdodh4wdfiemcp4e9x.jpg"},{"id":103218,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/ttiylhwud3mfvp772in4.jpg"},{"id":103219,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/bcn1saxxze2fpymqpqa7.jpg"},{"id":103220,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/zdqo4ev3nxxwdridsjqi.jpg"},{"id":103221,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/fm6bmiec1qsaqjlyeqwm.jpg"}],"summary":"Market Tycoon is a Tycoon game where you Grow your Market from a small Mini Market all the way up to a Hyper Market.  \nManage, Create and customize your Market  from wall paint to placing Cashiers,Shelves and Fridges.

Originally released for the Super Famicom, it was released on the Japanese Virtual Console in 2007 and a mobile phone in 2008 by G-Mode.\n\nThe game's plot and setting are loosely based around various episodes included in Greek mythology. The hero begins the game in a state of total memory-loss, but discovers that he has somehow acquired a mysterious power that shields him from all bodily harm, essentially making him immortal. The only clue the hero has in discovering his own identity is a mysterious dream that he sees every night, and he begins his journey in search of the location shown in the dream.\n\nThe gameplay borrows various motifs from ancient mythology, particularly the concept of immortality. An immortal character can execute certain actions that other characters cannot, like jumping off high cliffs without being injured. The game's writer, Kazushige Nojima, composed a storyline where the hero encounters the Greek gods while trying to discover his own true identity. Like the game's predecessor, Heracles no Eikō II: Titan no Metsubō, the game focuses on its rich storyline rather than the game system, which does not differ significantly from other role-playing video games of the period.","tags":[17,268435468,536870947,536871390,536872446,536896177,536896555,536900657,536902076]},{"id":33592,"name":"Eclipsed","platforms":[{"id":6,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}],"screenshots":[{"id":60402,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/uia9lcco3iea7lvulgnp.jpg"},{"id":60403,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/zoybaweq2iayqevyyzww.jpg"},{"id":60404,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/xnsbqz4ke21iidewnz3a.jpg"},{"id":60405,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/xc3t6sfpvck2yrzjykek.jpg"},{"id":60406,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/qahmc2pgnsuhb1jlsnii.jpg"}],"summary":"Eclipsed is a monochromatic adventure platform puzzle game.

She introduces herself as Lilia and tells Adol he is in the land of Ys. Finally he was able to establish a connection between his world and this mysterious land! But finding the gateway to Ys is not enough: Adol must stop an evil entity that his archenemy Dark Fact served. And his foes already know where he is. \n \nYs II: Ancient Ys Vanished - The Final Chapter is a direct sequel to Ys: The Vanished Omens. The game continues to utilize the action role-playing combat style of the first installment, which requires the player to make the protagonist run into the enemy in order to cause damage, without the need to press an attack button. The player should choose the angles and the measure of contact with the enemy carefully, otherwise the hero will be killed. The player character can (and should) level up, perform quests for village people, gather money, and upgrade weapons and inventory, like in most other RPGs. \n \nThe sequel offers a longer quest than the first installment, and adds a magic arsenal to Adol's abilities. Among the magic spells is a fire attack, a time-stopping spell, and a transformation ability that allows Adol to pass for a monster and converse with enemies. Magic spells deplete Adol's magic points bar.","tags":[1,17,268435468,268435487,536870990,536871059,536871138,536871139,536871208,536871301,536871938,536871939,536872201,536872425,536872617,536872793,536873065,536873066,536873154,536873384,536873863,536874745,536874830,536875055,536875132,536875318,536875372,536875396,536875453,536875472,536875505,536875525,536875639,536875779,536875827,536875830,536875837,536875855,536875942,536876199,536876267,536876286,536876299,536876333,536876557,536876847,536876974,536876976,536877029,536877207,536877216,536877238,536877380,536877422,536877596,536877973,536878299,536878366,536879765,536880171,536880243,536880251,536880316,536880960,536882800]},{"id":51568,"name":"Memories of Home","platforms":[{"id":6,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}],"screenshots":[{"id":113154,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/ybcnfss0qpypvq6hdjsn.jpg"},{"id":113155,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/jvkfujchxwvtejpi4f5j.jpg"},{"id":113156,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/ohhvfjpngyanzz49gxtc.jpg"},{"id":113157,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/jgbgsfrpleqeluzranfk.jpg"},{"id":113158,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/e30t7aie3gmj6dbpd86i.jpg"}],"summary":"Brian Tomaskie awakens in the dead of night during a power outage.
