Players can command an elite force of Colonial Marines, stalk their prey as a member of the Predator clan, or scurry along in packs as the acid-spitting Aliens. Gameplay involves advancing through a series of missions ranging in locale from jungles and caverns to futuristic battlefields and space colonies. Each faction offers ten types of combat units that can be upgraded over time with new attributes or equipment specific to the species. Predators, for instance, increase their number of vision modes, Aliens impregnate their victims with facehuggers, while Colonial Marines receive new weapon enhancements. As in titles like StarCraft, units range in scope from standard grunts and infantry to specialized forces and massive troop transports.",

You get points for missing as many times as possible before hitting. Event 2 is based on shooting ability and is in two stages. First you must shoot the targets of criminals (but not innocents) as they emerge from the ground, next you must shoot the bottles they throw at you from over the horizon. \n \nEvent 3 is Calf Roping, in which you must position yourself so as to be able to throw your rope around the poor cow\u0027s neck. This is followed by Bronco Riding, in which you must adjust your balance to compensate for the Bronco trying to throw you off, by pushing the joystick out to balance two bars. Level 5 starts off like the Cow Roping, as you jump onto a Steer, before a joystick-waggling section starts. Last of all is a side-scrolling game in which you jump onto a stagecoach which has been invaded by Indians, and beat up the hijacker.",

The series is known for some mistranslations from its original Japanese language to western language. The title of the series is portmanteau of the words \"onee-chan\" which means \"big sister\" and \"chanbara\" which means \"sword fighting\" which the story follows the eldest sister Aya from the start of the series accompanied by her younger sister Saki as they attempt to bring back their mother Tsubaki but learn their Baneful Blood clan heritage and the truth behind it. Onee Chanbara Origin is prequel to the events of Bikini Samurai Squad long before the events of Z2: Chaos story long and the ZPF was formed.\n\nOnee Chanbara Origin is a remake of the story from the first two games in the series which were never published to the western audience within a new engine and new art style to accompany multiple returning features from the previous games redone and tailored to the games improved experience on the series formula.\n\nReturning features to the series is:\nWeapon degradation in which they become covered in blood and start losing their effectiveness until wiped clean.\nBlood Lust/Blood Frenzy makes a return with some slight changes that improve character damage and speed when activated but also comes with a draw back that can punish players by lowering their defensive capabilities by increasing how much damage they will take if hit.\nBerserk mechanic which takes the effects of Blood-Lust even further but also bring one more draw back being that your life force drains at a constant rate and can be replenished by dealing damage and spilling the blood of enemies in combat during this enhanced transformation.\nParry mechanic has received some changes since the previous games and becomes far more useful with being able to nullify an incoming attack and potentially stun the target allowing for quick counter attacks if timed well, parrying to soon or to late will result in being put into a recovery state where you become vulnerable for a brief time.\nDodge/Run mechanic has been improved to recover energy when dodging attacks to allow faster charge up of your Special/Signature attack, Running speeds up your movement while allowing you to re-engage enemies with gap closing attacks that blend into your combo chains this also works with dodging attacks to extend combos or modify attacks.\nInfinite Mode makes a return from Bikini Samurai Squad where you can level up and test your skills in increasingly difficult fights as you climb the supposed endless number of floors.\nRe-recorded signature OST tracks as well as brand new tracks just for this release to really put the emphasis on the action for the series.\nFamiliar control scheme that has been very much the staple of the series but with vast improvements with responsiveness and tighter control over movement and combat while keeping this fast and fluid.",

    "summary": "Hi-Octane is a racing/vehicular combat video game released in 1995 for the PC, PlayStation and Sega Saturn developed by Bullfrog and based upon their earlier Magic Carpet game code. \n \nIt is notable amongst racing games for its wide and open tracks, and the resulting freedom offered to the player, and also for its excessive speed. It suffered in the marketplace due to thematic similarities with the better received Wipeout by Psygnosis and the generality of its graphics engine made for a very short depth of view compared to contemporary racing games. \n \nHi-Octane is rumored to begin life as something several Bullfrog programmers coded in free time, and then decided to improve the game and market it under the auspices of Electronic Arts. Another version of the legend is: EA set Bullfrog under pressure to release Dungeon Keeper or Magic Carpet 2 - but they weren\u0027t able to. So they released Hi-Octane, a quickly done game. \n \nIn a Gamasutra article it was mentioned that \"PC and Saturn racing game Hi-Octane, was developed in just eight weeks using the Magic Carpet engine, as a way to “fill a quarter that didn\u0027t have enough revenue”.",

You\u0027re going into combat against the best the enemy can offer, but you\u0027ve got the most advanced fighting helicopter in the world at your fingertips, packed with a devastating array of lethal weapons and state-of-the art technology.\n\nYou\u0027re ready to rock and roll but so is the enemy! They\u0027re waiting for you with combat helicopters of their own, backed up by radar-guided anti-aircraft guns and missiles and fixed wing aircraft. It\u0027s not going to be a cakewalk but you and your Apache are up to the challenge. Across four theaters of war-- Fort Hood where you train and then in war zones in Cyprus, Yemen, and Korea--you will fly the most fearsome helicopter that has ever been designed against enemies on land, sea, and air.\n\nApache Longbow took flying simulators to the next level. The developers constructed the flight model with fanatical attention to detail, going so far as to bring in Apache pilots to fly the in-game chopper and offer their feedback on how real the experience felt. Every flight simulator enthusiast will be pleased with the complexity and realism this game has to offer. Meanwhile, to make the game more accessible there is also an arcade mode where the flight mechanics aren\u0027t nearly as realistic, but there\u0027s still tons of fun to be had. So whichever you are - a slow-and-low hardcore sim fan or someone who just likes to fly about and blow things up - this game has something for you.",

The story is influenced by moral decisions the protagonist makes, aligning him either with the Order, the Ring of Gaea, or setting him up as an independent agent.\n\nThe gameplay uses first-person navigation of dungeons and turn-based battles against demons. The player can recruit demons as allies by talking to them rather than fighting them, and two to three demons can be fused to create new demons.",

    "summary": "Two of gaming\u0027s all-time classics are reborn on DS. Stories tell of a land of yore, now shrouded by centuries of time forgotten, called Ys. Despite its great knowledge, endless wealth, and bountiful prosperity, a sudden and unexpected cataclysm devastated the realm. Soon, its memory had faded completely from the minds of man. Centuries later, a young adventurer named Adol set sail to explore the world and leave his mark on history. During his travels, he learned of the tragic tale of Esteria, a once prosperous island now inexplicably engulfed by a crippling storm. Adol plotted a course for the besieged isle, curious to unravel the mystery... Available to North American audiences for the first time, this ultimate translation delivers the most substantial version of the famous Ys story ever made. Two games in one, Ys was released separately overseas, but North American gamers get them together. One of the longest-running, most beloved action RPGs of all-time, Ys has features exclusive to DS including 3D graphics, multiplayer, touch support, and more.",

Set in the year 3010, this game envisions a world where evil governments are desperate for something good to put on TV to entertain their teeming masses. The solution - a race. In this race the runner races around an obstacle strewn track chased by a machine that is a cross between a tank and a steam roller. Stay ahead and you win, get caught and you\u0027re history.  \n \nThe player\u0027s point of view is always above and in front of the runner, looking back at them as they run towards the camera. The track is littered with objects which the runner must either avoid, jump over, or duck under. These obstacles can just pop up out of the track as the runner approaches so quick reactions are needed. \n \nThere are three game modes:  \n \nStandard Mode: here there is the Single sprint mode where the player can practice any unlocked circuit. Then there\u0027s the Multiple Sprint mode which is locked until Tournament Mode has been completed, completing the Multiple Sprint mode unlocks 16th stadium.  \n \nTournament Mode: here there are five leagues, completing a league will unlock further stadiums and hence give access to the next league. Completing the final league unlocks stadium fifteen and the Multiple Sprints mode  \n \nExploration Mode: Here the player has to complete series of races that unlock new characters.",

    "summary": "Stationfall is an interactive fiction computer game written by Steve Meretzky and released by Infocom in 1987. Like the majority of Infocom\u0027s works, it was released simultaneously for several popular computer platforms of the time, such as the Commodore 64, Apple II, and PC. The game is a sequel to Planetfall, one of Infocom\u0027s most popular titles. It is Infocom\u0027s twenty-fifth game.\n\nFollowing the events on Resida in Planetfall, the player\u0027s character received a promotion from lowly Ensign Seventh Class to Lieutenant First Class. The life of an officer in the Stellar Patrol is no better than that of a humble enlistee, however. Five years after the thrills of saving an entire planet from destruction, the character is stuck in a boring desk job that demands piles of tedious paperwork instead of menial cleaning duties.\n\nA typically boring assignment comes in: accompany a spacetruck to a space station and pick up a load of \"Request for Stellar Patrol Issue Regulation Black Form Binders Request Form Forms\". To make things even more dull, spacetrucks are fully automated, so it will pilot itself once the proper coordinates are entered.\n\nBut the task does authorize the use of a robot assistant, and coincidentally enough, Floyd, a beloved companion revived at the end of Planetfall, is one of the choices.",

The matched set disappears, allowing gem tiles to drop into the gaps from above; if more matched sets form as a result, they disappear as well.\n\nWhenever tiles disappear, the background grid positions turn gold. The player must turn every square on the board to gold in order to complete the level. Failing to do so within the given time limit, or reaching a situation in which no more swaps are possible, costs one life and sends the player back to the start of that level.",

The game was released simultaneously for many platforms, including the IBM PC, Apple II, Amiga, Atari ST and Commodore 64. It is Infocom\u0027s twenty-second game.\nGalley and Lawrence previously wrote Seastalker for Infocom.\n\nThe player\u0027s character is a young detective, asked by friend Tamara Lynd to investigate her new home of Tresyllian Castle in Cornwall, England. Tamara has recently become engaged to the castle\u0027s lord, Jack Tresyllian. She was very happy until she began seeing what appeared to be The White Lady, a ghost who has allegedly haunted the castle for centuries. As if seeing a ghost wasn\u0027t nerve-racking enough, she\u0027s also begun to fear for her life. Is Tamara\u0027s imagination just overly excited from living in a large old castle, or is someone really trying to kill her? And if her life is in danger, is it from a ghost or someone using it as a disguise?",

    "summary": "Sound Fantasy, titled Sound Factory during development, is an unreleased video game for the Super NES/Super Famicom. Designer Toshio Iwai was inspired by his earlier interactive installation art piece titled Music Insects, to develop a video game at Nintendo between 1993 and late 1994. The completed product was inexplicably canceled by Nintendo, and the game\u0027s key elements were later developed into Maxis\u0027s 1996 PC game release titled SimTunes.\n\nSound Fantasy contains eccentric concepts and untested game mechanics. Music games, especially on home consoles, were not popular in the early 1990s, and it wouldn\u0027t be until much later in the decade that they gained mainstream attention.[citation needed] The Sound Fantasy prototype contains four different games in one cartridge.\n\nPix Quartet was inspired by Toshio Iwai\u0027s Music Insects. There are four insects of different colors, where the player can select different insect to each represent a different instrument. They crawl all over the screen, where the player can draw. Insects that crawl over a colored pixel make a note. Each color represents a different note for each insects. Sample Demos can be loaded to demonstrate the capabilities of this game.\n\nBeat Hopper contains three different modes: A-type, B-type and Training. A-type is a rhythm game in the style of Q-bert, where an insect on a pogo must make every block disappear after stepping on it as many times needed. Each block makes its own sound and the order does not matter. The player can improvise a song with each block. B-type requires the player to follow a path of blocks that appears every time the player touches one. The player must make as many steps as possible without losing three lives.\n\nIce Sweeper indicates two modes: A-type and B-type. This game is a Breakout clone with a few new twists added after a few stages, such as four bats controlled by a single player.\n\nStar Fly is inspired by music boxes, where the player can set a sequence of stars in the sky, to compose a song. A higher star corresponds to a higher musical note. The player may set the speed and the tone.",
