Baseball Stars 2 for the Nintendo Entertainment System was distributed by Romstar in 1992. Changes made from the original Baseball Stars, released by SNK in 1989: Female players are no longer included in any form. Two additional batting stances. These additional stances are never used for players on custom teams. They will only appear on the pre-made teams\u0027 players. Enhanced pitch control. Ability to shift field formations when playing defense. Ability to view your team roster and ratings while in-game. Sidearm-style pitchers are never generated on custom teams. They can only be hired. Easier bunting controls; bunts are now retractable. (Hold Down+A to bunt instead of stopping the swing partway through.) Ability to see lead-offs while pitching/batting. Six pitchers and four bench players instead of five each. New music and home run animations. These include the \"Power connect\" graphic for a two-run home run, an animated graphic of the batter rounding the bases and pumping his fist for a 3-run home run or grand slam, and a similar (yet very rare) graphic including a Yorkshire terrier following the batter for a come-from-behind (usually game-ending) home run in a dramatic situation. Can no longer name custom teams or rename players on custom teams. You can still upgrade player using the same 15-point system introduced in the original Baseball Stars. However, the random points you get to disperse to various skills each time you purchase a player upgrade changed from between 1 and 6 to between 1 and 5. Player upgrades overall are much more expensive while the money received during play has remained about the same. This makes it much more time-consuming to upgrade players to maximum. You can still fire players and hire players. However, due to the fact you cannot change the names of hired players your hired player will always be named generic names given by the game (examples \u0027STAR 5\u0027, \u0027ROOK 2\u0027, etc.). This can also lead to multiple players sharing the same name throughout the custom teams, even conceivably multiple players on the same team with the same name. Players can still create leagues of up to 125 games (6 teams playing each other 25 times) and view statistics such as League Standings and Top 10 in Average, Home Runs, Runs Batted In, Earned Run Average, Wins and Saves. (A peculiar glitch occurs when viewing league leaders. The last pitcher listed on any user-created team in \"View Team\" does not appear in any of the Top 10 leaderboards.)",

Their thirst for conflict, however, followed them. It was only once scientists realized the sun was dying that man finally learned to work together.

Once all bricks are destroyed in a level, you proceed to the next one. When all your lives are gone, you have lost.\n\nThe unique thing about this Breakout is that you don\u0027t just control one single paddle (which is usually on the lower side of the screen), but you control actually four paddles simultaneously (on each side of the screen is one paddle).\n\nThe paddle control is so made, that you can easily move all four paddle just with your mouse. But the result is, that only two paddles are normal (left to right; up to down). The other two are reverse (moving the mouse left to right will move the paddle right to left).\n\nThe game itself offers two game modes, Classic and Extreme. Classic is the actual Breakout game, where you play through 12 levels. Extreme is basically Classic minus Breakout. All you need to do is to reflect the ball as long as possible (the often the ball hits the paddles, the more you score).",

The arsenal consists of single or dual pistols, shotguns, machine guns, shotguns and other items such as a scope, dynamite and boiler plates. Weapons can be found by picking them off dead players or through the in-game buy menu. Cash for the weapons is earned by killing players or by collecting it in the level where it respawns regularly. Through the same menu, ammunition can be bought. \n \nThe levels often offer a stealth approach, hiding behind crates or shooting through windows that can break. Weapons can only contain a small amount of bullets (unless an additional ammo belt is bought) and need to be reloaded regularly. Different body parts can be targeted for different damage and when hit players notice a small slowdown in movement. \n \nSingleplayer is also available with all the team modes, but with the same maps and game modes to be played against bots with customizable skill levels. It is also possible to play a game with a handicap to even the odds. All levels come with a proper soundtrack that fits the theme.",

The quaint kingdom lacks the highly developed machinery and alchemy of the larger nation, but is nonetheless poised to join the Republic. However, many obstacles must first be overcome.\n\nTo minimize criticism from opposition parties, Arls proposes a development project to increase its influence. To begin, a number of skilled adventurers are dispatched to Arls from Arland, including the alchemist Totori Helmold, the star of Atelier Totori. Meruru, Princess of Arls, maneuvers to become Totori’s apprentice with aspirations of becoming an alchemist in her own right.\n\nMeruru’s quest is to develop her kingdom before Arls becomes part of Arland. Enlisting the help of her friends, Meruru will synthesize, explore, build, and battle her way to making a bigger and better kingdom.",

Step into Mack’s shoes in this guided first-person shooter as he takes on the invading aliens with only his trusty recycle cannon and a can-do attitude. Blast and vacuum (yes, vacuum) your way to victory, by keeping in mind that every shot counts—because your ammo also doubles as your health, and every enemy you destroy leaves behind Can Energy that you can vacuum up and use as ammo. Uncomplicated controls (including optional Wii Zapper support) give everyone the chance to save the earth, while advanced tactics like consecutive hit combos and the tough Challenge mode give even the best players a run for their money.

    "summary": "World in Conflict focuses on real-time tactics (RTT) gameplay, in a similar manner to Ground Control, a game also developed by Massive Entertainment, in which players deploy units onto a battlefield and must carefully make use of them to achieve victory, making use of support assets to further assist them. World in Conflict contains three factions: the United States, Soviet Union, and NATO. While players may only play as US and NATO forces during the single-player campaign, all three factions can be used in multiplayer games. \n \nDuring a game, players are given a pre-determined amount of reinforcement points, with which to purchase units with varying costs. Once the player deploys the units they purchase, they must wait 20 seconds for them to be airdropped to the field. If a unit is destroyed, the points are refunded to the player in order to allow them to bring in more units. During the single-player campaign, most missions vary what units the player can recruit, while some missions will offer the opportunity to recruit free units, though these cannot be replaced if destroyed. Each unit has strengths and weaknesses, such as mobile anti-air guns being most effective against enemy helicopters, and repair tanks being most effective at keeping vehicles and armor repaired. Each unit possesses a defensive ability, such as deploying smokescreens, while some units possess an offensive ability, such as marking targets for bombardment or using grenade launchers on enemy infantry. Once a unit\u0027s special ability(ies) has been spent, players must wait for them to recharge before they can be used again. \n \nIn addition to controlling units, players may also call in tactical aid by spending tactical aid points. Points are primarily earned from destroying enemy units in battle. Tactical Aids allow the player to call in anything, from airstrikes on enemy positions, the deployment of paratroopers, to launching carpet bombing raids and tactical nuclear strikes. Tactical aids can allow up to three deployments, after which the player must wait until the support has recharged. In the single-player campaign, players are restricted by what tactical aid they can use, which can change during a mission. \n \nThe game interface for World in Conflict has no framing in the game. A list of units occupies the bottom center, whereas the top right hand corner contains the expandable reinforcement procurement list. The mini map is in the bottom left hand corner, while the bottom right hand corner contains the special abilities buttons (including unit formation). Players can also use a messaging system that is designed to allow conversation between individuals regardless of whether they are on the same server or playing the same game. World in Conflict features a fully rotational 360 degree camera.",

It is a world of automation, a utopia gone wrong in which all of humanity have transferred their minds into robotic imposter bodies and are ruled by a deranged computer. It’s being published by Adult Swim, and has Stacking’s Lee Petty at the helm here on the good ship Double Fine.\n\nYou are the last known human in the universe, and all that’s left of you is a disembodied head. Seeking clues to your fractured past, you must travel through a hostile world of machines, using a special helmet that allows you to dock into and take control of any robotic host body. As you launch from one body to the next, you’ll start to discover that things are not quite what they appear to be, and the fate of humanity has yet to be decided…",

The main character, Naughty Bear, is a shabby teddy bear who has a tendency to be mischievous, which earns him the dislike of the other bears. Like the other teddy bears, he does not speak but instead conveys his emotions through a variety of sounds and facial expressions. His actions are influenced by an unseen narrator with a demeanor reminiscent of that of a young children\u0027s television show host.[2][3]",

Villages provide food as well as villagers, who are weak warriors, but attack in hordes and when they turn to berserkers, they can gain a destructible force. Gold can be gathered at mines, mage towers can shoot fireballs and destroy garrisons in enemy houses, etc.",

Battles reward smart tactics and aggressive offense by tying stamina pools to both skill usage and damage reduction. Enemies are challenging, but an understanding of the options each character has available to them will take you farther than grinding levels will.\n\nEach ally\u0027s personality traits affect their combat prowess and abilities. As the story goes on and the stakes are raised, these traits will develop (and degrade!) along with the character\u0027s mental state.

A significant update from PS1, it allowed players to manage in one of six European leagues, all of which were processed by the game simultaneously (the top two divisions in Italy, Spain, Germany and France were added, in addition to the existing top four divisions in England and Scotland). On the PS2, matches played out in full in a 3D match environment, followed by post-match highlights voiced by famous BBC presenter Gary Lineker alongside the returning Hansen. The game play advanced in this game from the 2001 version, in particular the in-match style. Players tend to shoot early, from around thirty yards, rather than enter into the penalty area.",

Inspired by the novel \"The island of Doctor Moreau\" by HG Wells. \n \nThe English expedition \"Peary \u0026 Scott\" discovers an island populated by strange and ferocious creatures. Half-human, half-animal, they were created by the famous Dr. Moreau. Peary, a scientist and biologist, resumes his work. \n \nAt a time when the abolition of slavery continues to grow worldwide, Scott, a wealthy industrialist and close to the royal family, sees huge potential in those \"beasts\": Cheap, hardworking manpower, easily renewable, and gifted with remarkable physical abilities. \n \nIn just 20 years, in secret, Peary and Scott will create hundreds of these \"beasts\" and build an empire. Inevitably, however, humans will lose control of the island: The north is occupied by humans, trapped and hidden behind their wall; while the rest of the island is populated by various generations of \"beasts\", which are often hostile towards each other. Most degenerate very quickly, and fall in bestial madness. \n \nThis is where your story begins: you are one of those \"beasts\". Your task will be long and difficult: Explore, develop, understand and reclaim the island, while respecting the law of Moreau. \n \nWill you keep your faith in humanity until the end of this journey ?",
