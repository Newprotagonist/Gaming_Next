Following the concept of Taito\u0027s Bubble Bobble, the rod doesn\u0027t kill the monsters directly, but only leaves them immobilized, crying. To kill them, the rod can grasp them in a magic force-field and the player can smash them down over her head until they disappear and leave a power-up behind.\n\nEach level is only one small screen composed of monsters, platforms, ladders and, later, tunnels. Unlike other games of the genre, the players can never jump, but have to use ladders. They can conjure one custom ladder above or below them in order to go to the appropriate platform. There can be only one such \u0027custom\u0027 ladder; therefore if the fairy summons it again, it will disappear from its previous position in order to appear again next to the fairy. This can be beneficial for the player, if a monster is climbing that ladder to approach her.\n\nThe fairies\u0027 quest is to rescue their mother, trapped in a tower. In the sequel (part of the original arcade machine) they must venture into a pyramid, to stop an evil demon that is building a mobile fortress. The spirit of their departed father \"guides\" them at a couple of points. The ending implies that the demon in the pyramid was somehow responsible for their father\u0027s death.",

    "summary": "Linda \u0026 Joan is a narrative game about a British family. You play as Russell, Linda, and Joan — son, mother, and grandmother — switching between them to help the family cope with a series of traumatic events. Based on a true story. \n \nThe main game is scheduled for release in 2022. It will be part two of the Linda \u0026 Joan story. Part one is Prologue: “Four Months Earlier” which was released in July 2020. \n \nPlayers experience the events from the perspectives of Russell, Linda, and Joan through exploration, conversation, and tasks designed to give emotional insight into the themes of caregiving, dying, bereavement, and homeland. \n \nWhat sets Linda \u0026 Joan apart from other branching-narrative experiences is that while the player has many choices to make, nothing can change the core events that follow — there is only one ending. \n \nHowever, actions, dialogue choices, and task completion, do affect the characters’ perception of events. By spending time with happier memories, taking care of themselves, and choosing the right things to say to each other, the characters — and therefore the player — will find themselves able to deal with the impossible. \n \nThe characters’ emotional states will be graphically represented in the game. The player will have to carefully balance the needs of the characters to progress, sometimes requiring difficult zero-sum tradeoffs. \n \nThese mechanisms attempt to mirror the real-life feeling of being powerless in the face of looming trauma, when you realize that no decision can affect the outcome, but you can affect how you and others feel about it. \n \nEven when life’s story feels like it’s on rails, we still have some power over our own realities. There is still room for dignity, compassion, honesty. For fear and for love. There is a time for self-care. There is a time for duty. The choices we make will define the memories we hold for the rest of our lives.",

Gaia no Monshō is a turn-based strategy game at heart - the player moves troops around a battlefield and attacks nearby enemy units. An Auto Battle mode is also available and gives the option to let the AI figure out of the player\u0027s next move. The game offers several play modes - the first one (Scenario Mode) gives the player the chance to jump straight into battle using predefined troops. The second (Construction Mode) allows him to build his own army using unit points. The last one (Campaign Mode) conveys story plot elements and starts in the siege town of Dirl, where king Sieghart battles the fierce Böser. This mode requires more complex strategy and the player must assemble his own troops using unit points and units lost in battle don\u0027t come back during the campaign. Unlike the other two modes, it offers a password system to save the player\u0027s progress through the game.",

Kyle Katarn, a formal Imperial Stormtrooper must join the Rebel Alliance\u0027s covert operations division, and re-take the Empire from the inside, one battle at a time.\n\nUnlike many other Doom-based games, Star Wars: Dark Forces attempted a realistic approach: the missions followed a specific storyline, sometimes cut up by scenes to progress the narrative. Each mission had its own briefing and objective. The levels were designed to represent actual bases, mines, facilities, and other known places from the Star Wars universe, like Star Destroyer interiors, Jabba\u0027s ship, Coruscant, etc.",

There are several mini games as bonuses in the game.\n\nAll through the game, they try to take these things while avoiding the Sniffer, (Dwayne the Verminator), who tries to defeat them by using mind-controlled vermin he has captured as his \"henchmen.\" At one point, many animals, including weasels, badgers, and even Vincent the bear are controlled.",

    "summary": "Developed by Ubisoft Montpellier, the studio behind critically acclaimed titles like From Dust, Beyond Good \u0026 Evil and, Ghost Recon Advanced Warfighter, ZombiU puts players in the middle of London circa 2012, where an outbreak has infected the population, destroying their humanity and turning them into mindless monsters preying on the flesh of the few remaining survivors. This fear-fueled first-person shooter invites takes all the horror, chaos and tension found in the best of the horror genre and adds original interactive elements, including a unique death mechanic that puts players in the body of a different survivor each time they die, allowing them to track and take down their old, infected characters, recover their equipment and see if they can stay alive just a little bit longer this time.",

The sprites are recoloured in a more vibrant cartoon-esque style, as opposed to the washed out effect from the games, to match the style of the Marvel vs Capcom series. If two players get Lou, then the second player\u0027s pallette is Green, and is most likely based on Siva\u0027s color clothing from the Midnight Wanderers game. Player two\u0027s firestorm is colored orange.\n\nLou\u0027s Companion Siva, has a character based on him as a tribute, featuring on Capcom\u0027s Cannon Spike game.

The first version of the game was released as freeware on December 21, 2005 on Marco Incitti\u0027s Blitz Creations website.\n\nAlthough other freeware games similar to Geometry Wars exist, GridWars eventually became so popular that Bizarre emailed Incitti and asked him to take the game down, citing that they were \"beginning to feel the Geometry Wars clone\u0027s effects on our sales via Microsoft now and are beginning a process to begin to more robustly protect our copyright and intellectual property\". The link to the download was pulled from the site on August 8, 2006. The game was subsequently released on a German website dedicated to Flash and freeware games and is available for Windows, OS X and Linux.\n\nUnlike Geometry Wars which eventually plateaus in difficulty facilitating high scores in the range of hundreds of millions of points, GridWars 2 has an exponentially increasing difficulty curve. Eventually, the enemy spawn sites become so large that they nearly envelop the entire grid.\n\nAnother important difference from Geometry Wars is the ability to \"farm\" black holes. Besides distracting and swallowing enemies, the black holes can net points (and thus bombs/lives) based on the square of the number of enemies they have swallowed."

This was the territory of the demi-humans who have resided here peacefully for thousands of years. \n \nOne time, the ‘Kami no Kaido’, the ruler of the southeastern plains who is close to God, declared that he would train a successor to inherit his immense power and knowledge. With those words, he opened the gates to the holy land, ‘Shrine of the End’ (Tsui no Goshi). The successor candidates were bestowed the privilege to explore the previously-sealed area and various abilities by the Kami no Kaido, to overcome the severe trials that lay before them. \n \nYouths from all races and religions heeded this call and gathered together, including the young researcher Erballade who left his hometown to seek wisdom and the unknown. There will only be one successor. With honour, wisdom, power and wealth, along with the expectations of their hometowns, a fierce competition is about to begin.",

It was allegedly discovered by a prospector named Jacob Waltz, an old German immigrant who wandered the Superstitions during the early 1880\u0027s. He claimed the mine was so rich that the gold could be removed with only a knife.\n\nWaltz died on October 25, 1891, but he left behind many clues as to the location of his fabulous mine. One clue was to look for a pointed peek. Many people believe this peak is the landmark known today as Weaver\u0027s Needle. He also claimed his mine was located where no miner would ever look. Many old maps have A surfaced purporting to show the location of Waltz\u0027s treasure, but none have proven genuine.\n\nToday the Superstition Mountains continue to draw those who seek the fabled wealth of the King of precious metals. And Weaver\u0027s Needle still stands guard over Jacob Waltz\u0027s tantalizing secret... the Lost Dutchman Mine.",

Its gameplay is very similar to that of its predecessor, The Settlers, albeit with a Roman theme and improved graphics. It is the second game in The Settlers series. \n \nMany fans of the franchise consider this the best game of the series, primarily because future instalments changed the transport management aspect considerably. This popularity encouraged Blue Byte to publish a remake of the game, The Settlers II (10th Anniversary) for Windows and release a port of the original game on Nintendo DS.",

These include combining archaic technology such as biplanes with more advanced machinery; firing and power-up system; and a medal collecting system which drastically increases scoring. The game features a similar method of earning bombs and a delay when launching them as well.\n\nA notable feature of Ibara is the inclusion of a variable, real-time difficulty system by way of the Rank system. The player\u0027s rank increases as they acquire more items and cause more damage, increasing the difficulty of the game along with it. The number of enemies does not increase but the number of bullets fired towards the user does, often reaching a ridiculous level of bullet density.\n\nThere are ways of lowering this rank system if the odds appear too much. The only known way of decreasing the player\u0027s Rank in Ibara is to die. The more lives you have, the less the rank decreases when you die.",

    "summary": "Twenty-two years after making his groundbreaking debut on the Atari 2600, Activision\u0027s Pitfall Harry returns for more jungle-exploring action. The intrepid adventurer is brought to life for more than 50 perilous levels set in such exotic South American locales as rainforests, glaciers, mines, and ancient ruins. As in the original, players must utilize Harry\u0027s athletic prowess to swing from vines, run from rolling logs, hop over treacherous pits, avoid snapping crocodiles, and more, while trying to survive the hostile environment.\n\nHis objectives? To retrieve lost artifacts before they fall into the hands of his rival and to save those in danger. Pitfall Harry will eventually encounter situations that even he can\u0027t conquer with a well-timed jump or two, so players can pull items stored in his knapsack to assist him. Like the character\u0027s single foray on the original PlayStation, this game is designed to make players smile while exploring the mysterious lands before them. Although Pitfall 3D made use of Bruce Campbell\u0027s voice for its comic effect, Pitfall Harry attempts to use its visuals to elicit grins, with the protagonist drawn as a caricature, with a large head balanced atop a slender body.\n\nAs the story begins, Harry is a member of a treasure-hunting expedition whose plane goes down in the forest. The other survivors are scattered throughout the game; an older, wiser adventurer who was on the plane -- and who becomes incapacitated during the accident -- urges Harry to embark on a quest to save them while battling a rival, eco-unfriendly group of treasure hunters for the relics of the jungle so they can be returned to their rightful owners. He hands Harry the \"Hero\u0027s Handbook\" and Harry\u0027s off to adventure. The \"Hero\u0027s Handbook\u0027s\" pages are scattered throughout the levels just like the crash survivors are. Find new pages, and Harry will learn new moves.",

By conversing with the troubled A.I. and rearranging his fragmented book, players decide how (and if) his book should end. A logic-driven combinatorial narrative system allows the player\u0027s input to shape the story with far more fidelity than most story-based games.\n\nThe game works with the physical printed book \"The Ice-Bound Compendium.\" This full-color 80-page art book unlocks new levels and pieces of the A.I. writer\u0027s past. Seen through the iPad camera or laptop webcam, the book\u0027s pages come alive via augmented reality tech, with new layers of secrets inscribed onto its pages.",

    "summary": "007: Quantum of Solace is a James Bond video game based on the films Casino Royale and Quantum of Solace. Several different versions of the game were released across seven platforms, with the PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, Wii and PC designed as first-person shooters and the PlayStation 2 and Nintendo DS as third-person shooters. It is powered by the Call of Duty 4 game engine.\n\nThe core gameplay in Quantum of Solace is that of a first-person shooter. Throughout the game, however, the view will switch to a third-person view to emphasize that the player is playing as James Bond. This third-person view will be used with a cover system and quick time events, among other scenarios. An example is using quick time events to chase Mollaka during a level that is a recreation of the construction site chase at the beginning of the Casino Royale film.",

Armed with a sword and a ‘hand cannon’, all manner of nasty dungeon dwellers, bosses and traps will need to be defeated or traversed in order to emerge from the dungeon victorious!\n\nTo aid you in your quest, you may be lucky enough to encounter one or more upgrades or new abilities scattered throughout the dungeon, or bump into the remnants of other players (Champions) via the unlockable \u0027Champion Mode\u0027. Champions wander atop the dungeon walls, ready to unleash their souls upon passers by. Be careful though, as not all Champions are helpful.\n\nA randomly generated dungeon is created every playthrough, with many secrets and multiple outcomes.\n\nThe game features a dynamic difficulty and ranking system - the better you do, the more challenging the game will become. Only the most skilled dungeon escapees will attain the highest ranks.",

On offense, the player simply receives the ball upon the snap and either attempt to run with the quarterback, toss the ball to a running back, or throw the ball to the one long distance receiver - basically the option offense. On defense, the player chooses one of two players to control, and the computer manipulates the others. The ball can also be punted or a field goal can be attempted.\n\n10-Yard Fight has five levels of difficulty; from easiest to most difficult: high school, college, professional, playoff, and Super Bowl. If the player wins both halves of an \"accelerated real time\" 30-minute half at an easier level, the player advanced to the next level of difficulty, like a career mode.",

Players take turns to insert their current tile in one of the rows or columns. If a column is full, the bottom most tiles is crushed, if a row is full, tile falls at the opposite end out of the grid. Once three or more tiles of a kind form a line, the player is awarded points depending on type and number of tiles. With each 60 points of difference between the two players, one of the ten lamas switches the side. The game ends once the first player has all the lamas on their side.\n\nThe game became popular as a flash game ICQ users could play against their contacts.

French comic-book artist Philippe Druillet also worked on the game, providing much of the artwork.\n\nThe game makes a significant departure from the source material by binding the stories behind the four parts of the cycle with a surrealist science fiction background; the main plot involves a being by the name of ISH, who is guided by the voice of Erda, and who discovers the story of the Nibelungen.",

    "summary": "The second installment in the AoF series added the \"rage gauge\"; similar to the \"spirit system\" of its predecessor, it limited the use and effectiveness of special attacks.\nThe game\u0027s story is set a year after the original. Geese Howard, a rising star in South Town\u0027s criminal underworld, calls fighters to the city for a new tournament, \"The King of Fighters.\" Howard was the final boss and series villain of SNK\u0027s other fighting game franchise Fatal Fury (though he is a secret boss in this game), whose story took place over a decade after the events of Art of Fighting.\nArt of Fighting 2 was the only time Yuri Sakazaki was a playable character in the series. It also marked the only time that she donned her trademark outfit, which was made famous in The King of Fighters series. This game also marks the debut of Takuma Sakazaki without his Mr. Karate persona, as well as Eiji Kisaragi, who both appear in the King of Fighters series. Ryuhaku Todo, the first boss in the original AOF, is the only character dropped; all characters are playable from the beginning. The final boss is always Mr. Big, though as mentioned earlier, an extra match will be played against Geese Howard if the player unlocks him through good performance.\nThis game is also notorious for its difficulty, with it being referred in many fighting circles as having some of the toughest opponent AI in a fighting game.",

This is an all-new game which picks up where Edelweiss ended. \n \nThe heroines of this new story are Takase Sakura and Fujisaki Rin, two background characters who dominated the popularity polls and conquered the original heroines. This fan-disk will present an all-new story full of laughs and naughty things. \n \nOne scenario begins when Sakura, the girl many people suspect is a lesbian, is hanging with the guys and evaluating other chicks with them. When Kazushi says there’s no way he would ever fall for Sakura, Sakura puts her pride as a girl on the line and their competition begins. If he falls for her, he loses! As their classmates start a betting pool to see who’ll win and interfering to better their chances, who knows what ending awaits, let alone how Eiden Island’s power will affect the outcome! \n \nThe other scenario begins when Rin and Kazushi are both elected as their class representatives. As the two grow closer together, Kazushi winds up in an accident trying to save her. As a result, he suddenly finds himself with something that speaks residing in his crotch.",
