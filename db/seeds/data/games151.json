To that end, the organization has established a series of schools up and down the country. Mihama Academy more-or-less left to rot after its abrupt closure, has been given a new purpose as one such 'specialist training school'. Mihama now entrusts the misfit girls who attend it with guns and live ammunition. Paying their own safety no heed, these students are again and again plunged into dangerous extrajudicial missions - all for the good of the realm. No matter how much life grinds them down, what future awaits these girls, who've themselves chosen the path of the gun? \n \nGrisaia: Phantom Trigger 02 \nA VIP arriving from abroad mysteriously disappears in transit. The SORD team at Mihama Academy is presented with a new mission: finding and recovering him. Whenever they appear to be closing in on this missing \"package\", though, it somehow slips through their fingers. Accompanying them on their mission are two fellow SORD from the Kyousen Sakuragaoka campus - twin sisters, who both help and hinder the crew. There have also been rumors floating around of a daredevil biker named \"Soul Speed\", who tears up the streets at night. Before long, the team's thrilling chase descends into a deathmatch, pushing the combatants to their limits and beyond. Rena and Haruto, meanwhile, are taken on a journey deep into the past, to their first-ever encounter. \n \nGrisaia: Phantom Trigger 03 \nWhile Rena and Maki recover from their injuries, the other SORD members jet off overseas for a school trip.

Tohka's the star of the show this time round, but she's wrestling with her own issues - old memories of her parents, and a promise to a friend that she wasn't able to keep... \n“You're right. There's a reason we need to get back... even if it means crawling home on our hands and knees.” \n“Let's meet up again someday... if we're still alive.” \nAnd introducing Sengoku Ayame - Sengoku Ichiru's brother, and a handler at St. Aile's: \n“If taking her in alive's too much of a challenge, just get rid of her - I don't give a damn. I simply want to see this mess cleaned up.” \nWhat answers will Tohka find? \nShe has the truth in her sights... \n \nGrisaia: Phantom Trigger 04 \nKumashiro Megumi (Gumi), recently transferred from St. Aile's International School, has been training hard together with Rena and Maki – now fully recovered from their injuries. With the help of her mentor, Tohka, she's shaping up to be a fine sniper. \nJust as one new student settles in, another has her sights set on joining the girls in Class A, Mihama's elite combat unit. Her name? Sengoku Taiga. Haruto, the team's handler, has one condition for Taiga's transfer: that Chris serves as her supervising officer. \nThe two seem an unlikely pair at first, but after spending some time with little Taiga, Chris soon finds a way to see things from her perspective. \nIt's at that moment that the nation is suddenly rocked by a terror attack on an unprecedented scale. Chris rushes to the scene, aware of what's at stake, but paying no heed to the dangers ahead. \nJust as she did, once before. \n\"This is even worse than we could've imagined...\" \nThe death toll keeps on rising, but SORD are stuck watching helplessly from the sidelines. What destiny awaits Chris, Taiga... and Mihama Academy? \n\"Oh, right... I must have died...\" \nClutching to memories of her long-dead mother, she too prepares for an eternity of slumber... \n \nGrisaia: Phantom Trigger 05 \nA few weeks have passed since SORD successfully resolved the Kitaoka University terrorist incident - albeit with some sacrifices - when Murasaki's older sister Yuuki returns to Japan and returns to Mihama Academy. \nBeing more sociable and capable than her sister, Yuuki immediately befriends the other students and builds a trusting relationship with them. \n\"There's no reason for me to be at Mihama anymore...\" \nAs Murasaki starts questioning her raison d'etre, she reminisces about the time when she first met Haruto. \nA few years earlier... \nLamenting his lack of experience, he had come to her village hidden deep in the mountains in search of new skills. \nHe got to know the Ikoma sisters better and kept up with his training. As he seeks out the village's \"secret art\", a sudden tragedy befalls them. \n\"I'll never forgive you...!!\" \n\"It's okay... Don't worry... I'm not... going anywhere... I'm here with you...\" \n\"I'm stumped... It's exactly as she said - and there's no way to cut a phantom...\" \n\"Come on. Chin up... Show me your courage...\" \nTheir fateful meeting was also the beginning of a tragic story...","tags":[268435487]},{"id":187466,"cover":{"id":204608,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co4dvk.jpg"},"name":"Sit-Ups Workout","platforms":[{"id":130,"name":"Nintendo Switch"}],"screenshots":[{"id":712280,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scf9lk.jpg"},{"id":712281,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scf9ll.jpg"},{"id":712282,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scf9lm.jpg"}],"summary":"Are you ready for the 250 Sit-Ups Challenge?

Initially this version of the game was exclusively available through a crowdfunding action with a physical release containing a cartridge, but in the spirit of the original game both the game and the source code were eventually made available as a free download afterwards.\n\nThis release improves the original game by correcting a number of map bugs and imperfections. It also adds new colours and tweaks the movement to optimize it and make it more responsive. By completing the game two additional playable characters can be unlocked. Completing it once unlocks Zazelle and a second time Johnny Limite. They each have different moves providing different gameplay.\n\nThe crowdfunded version comes on a cartridge with a box and manual. The cartridges are numbered with a unique serial number. Based on the tier different extras were provided, such as having your name listed in the manual. There is also a tier with a blue cartridge limited to six copies. This tier comes with two bottles of Gik Blue wine.\n\nAlthough not directly confirmed, the CPC version of the game called Sir Ababol: NES-OM Edition listed here is most likely based on this 2017 NES version.","tags":[1,268435464,536871208,536872529,536895784,536902521]},{"id":135262,"cover":{"id":124504,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co2o2g.jpg"},"name":"Rayman Redemption","platforms":[{"id":6,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}],"screenshots":[{"id":389440,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc8chs.jpg"},{"id":389441,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc8cht.jpg"},{"id":389442,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc8chu.jpg"},{"id":389443,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc8chv.jpg"},{"id":389444,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc8chw.jpg"},{"id":389445,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc8chx.jpg"},{"id":389446,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc8chy.jpg"},{"id":389447,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc8chz.jpg"},{"id":389448,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc8ci0.jpg"},{"id":389449,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc8ci1.jpg"},{"id":389450,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc8ci2.jpg"},{"id":389451,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc8ci3.jpg"}],"summary":"Rayman Redemption is a reimagination of the original Rayman game from 1995.

Battles are team oriented, which allows building complex strategies to defeat strong ennemies.\n\nAn accent has been put on the world's richness. Never explore an empty world again: Mystria is filled with resources to harvest, random encounters to make, and secrets that are waiting to be discovered. Every time you explore a map, random elements will either spawn or not, which may open unknown paths. There is no level scaling in the game, and each of the 300 maps can be explored right from the beginning. Explore the world at your own risks!\n\nDuring fights, while one's soul can hold up to 10 Achivaras, but only 3 can be summoned at a time; strategies should be prepared thoroughly in order to win against strong opponents. Actions, which can be either of a sin or a virtue type, have different properties and can combo with other actions. If you don't have any Achivara alive anymore, the fight isn't over! In Unleashed, you have to fight yourself for your survival.\n\nFeedback from indie development forums:\n\"I am glad I took the time to click, because it looks great!\" - Typogre\n\"Certainly sounds like an interesting concept!\" - bfarnsey\n\"I love the art style.\" - ThylacineStudios\n\"This is potentially really cool-looking.

As Agent 47, you perform contract hits on powerful, high-profile targets in exotic locations around the world. Gameplay focuses on taking out targets in huge and intricate sandbox levels with complete freedom of approach. Where to go, when to strike and who to kill – it is all up to you.\n\nHITMAN is an expanding and evolving world of assassination. The experience began with a Prologue and Paris location in March, continued with Episode 2: Sapienza in April, Episode 3: Marrakesh in May, the Summer Bonus Episode in July, Episode 4: Bangkok in August and Episode 5: Colorado in September. The season finale in Hokkaido, Japan arrived on October 31st.\n\nHITMAN also features a major live component, which is made up of Elusive Targets, Escalation Contracts, Community-inspired Challenge Packs and Contracts Mode.\n\nAn Elusive Target is the closest thing to the Hitman fantasy that we’ve ever created. These targets will be custom-created characters that are added to existing locations and are only there for a limited time in real-time. You’ll only have one chance to take them down. If they escape, they are gone for good. If you kill them, that’s the way that you killed them. There are no do-overs and no second chances. When an Elusive Target leaves the game world (one way or another) they never return.\n\nEscalation Mode is something else completely new for HITMAN and was created as a way to regularly provide a fresh challenge to players. You’ll need to master the location as well as the gameplay mechanics to complete a hit that will escalate in difficulty by adding new elements. This mode has a strong focus on having fun with the game mechanics and mixing them up. It’s more about being playful than realistic.\n\nContracts Mode returns from Hitman Absolution; Play-to-create, mark your own targets, choose how to kill them and compete against your friends.

The plot calls for three cinematic musical features and battles between giant robots; like other Ganbare Goemon games, it is peppered with surrealist humor and anachronisms.\n\nThe protagonist of Mystical Ninja is Goemon, a hot-blooded, kiseru-wielding ninja with blue, bushy hair based loosely on the legendary thief Ishikawa Goemon. The lord of Oedo asks him to find those who maimed Oedo Castle. Goemon lives in Oedo Town and is friends with Ebisumaru, a strange, gluttonous fat man who wears a blue bandana. Ebisumaru is defined as lazy and perverted. Their kunai-throwing friend Sasuke is a mechanical ninja (made by the Wise Man of Iga) who enjoys hot baths and Japanese tea. Rounding out the heroes is Yae, a fierce sword-wielding kunoichi, who happens upon Goemon's band in Zazen Town. The villains of the game hail from the organization Peach Mountain Shoguns and include a gang of four \"weirdos\" led by Spring Breeze Dancin' (Danshin Harukaze) and Kitty Lily (Margaret Ranko). They intend to transform Japan into a stage for their talents.","tags":[1,17,22,27,268435464,268435487,536871076,536871079,536871262,536871761,536875046,536875067,536875282,536875434,536897818,536899615],"videos":[{"id":10094,"video_id":"-NQKAsvlKcE"}]},{"id":171219,"cover":{"id":179253,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co3ub9.jpg"},"name":"SpongeBob SquarePants: The Cosmic Shake","platforms":[{"id":6,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"},{"id":48,"name":"PlayStation 4"},{"id":49,"name":"Xbox One"},{"id":130,"name":"Nintendo Switch"}],"screenshots":[{"id":633868,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scdl3g.jpg"},{"id":633869,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scdl3h.jpg"},{"id":633870,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scdl3i.jpg"},{"id":633871,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scdl3j.jpg"},{"id":633872,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scdl3k.jpg"},{"id":633873,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scdl3l.jpg"},{"id":633874,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scdl3m.jpg"},{"id":633875,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scdl3n.jpg"},{"id":633876,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scdl3o.jpg"},{"id":633877,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scdl3p.jpg"}],"summary":"Wish-granting Mermaid’s Tears in the hands of SpongeBob and Patrick… What could go wrong?

Rather than the typical heavy emphasis on hunting, firearms, and dangerous animal species, Adventure Camp focuses on the more \"outdoorsy sportsman\" and camping aspects of the Cabela's brand. Here, the only hunting is with a bow and arrow, and the targets are merely cardboard shapes of animals like deer--when the targets aren't simple round concentric circles. \n \nThere are six playable characters, all children or young teens who are \"attending\" a Cabela's-themed camp. Hair and clothing colors can be changed, and stats are recorded. Another child, known as Greg, exists to grief the player during some points in certain events, which includes things like dropping boulders into the river during a kayaking event. Greg takes no active role in the gameplay, rather, unusual challenges or obstacles are \"blamed\" on the character. \n \nEvents in the game include kayaking, skeet shooting, archery, bicycling, and others. Two somewhat more \"unusual\" games also exist, one of which is a form of Whack-a-Mole combined with the memorization of the classic electronic game Simon. The other is a variation on Rock-Paper-Scissors called \"Bear-Hunter-Ninja\" and requires the players to stand in predefined stances to pose as a Bear, a Hunter, or a Ninja. Aside from the Whack-a-Mole and Bear-Hunter-Ninja games, all the other games have at least two variations, typically a different course or set of challenges, and can be played by two to four players. Coins/Emblems can be collected in many events, along with large gems for extra points.","tags":[1,40,268435470,536871106,536871186,536871614,536871936,536872205,536875046,536875157,536875240,536875257,536875271,536875349,536875802,536876260,536876695,536877160,536877208,536877830,536879187,536879233]},{"id":135008,"cover":{"id":216618,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co4n56.jpg"},"name":"Meeting in the Flesh","platforms":[{"id":6,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}],"screenshots":[{"id":663982,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sce8by.jpg"},{"id":663984,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sce8c0.jpg"},{"id":663986,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sce8c2.jpg"},{"id":663988,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sce8c4.jpg"},{"id":663989,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sce8c5.jpg"}],"summary":"Meeting in the Flesh is a free horror/romance visual novel.

It serves as a reboot of the franchise, with a new incarnation of Lara Croft. The typical third-person action-adventuring exploring is still present, and Lara can move more freely because she is no longer limited by specific jumps. As you travel through rough environments, you will need to run, dive, swim, climb on poles, ladders, roofs, use zip lines, shimmy, and vault, with acrobatic actions such as somersaults and flips. You need to cross difficult terrain, solve puzzles to advance or open up new areas, and engage in combat.","tags":[1,268435461,268435487,536870926,536870958,536870969,536871208,536871306,536871470,536871874,536871945,536872010,536872070,536872205,536872221,536872257,536872509,536873192,536873236,536873299,536873810,536873973,536874398,536874943,536875046,536875047,536875057,536875058,536875073,536875095,536875101,536875158,536875178,536875209,536875249,536875257,536875259,536875271,536875301,536875319,536875437,536875523,536875556,536875572,536875597,536875682,536875689,536875804,536875815,536875819,536875830,536875870,536875941,536876011,536876303,536876351,536876476,536876528,536876695,536876715,536876726,536876816,536876874,536876901,536876922,536877040,536877049,536877056,536877128,536877172,536877230,536877264,536877294,536877373,536877425,536877426,536877628,536877658,536877677,536878112,536878127,536878256,536878481,536878490,536879061,536879108,536879177,536879216,536879770,536880294,536880441,536881452,536881726,536883653,536883757,536884021,536884507,536885632,536888348,536893584,536893585],"videos":[{"id":53551,"video_id":"5NyY9cuNLR8"},{"id":53552,"video_id":"DcWrQyVOSS8"}]},{"id":166063,"cover":{"id":175262,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co3r8e.jpg"},"name":"Parquet","platforms":[{"id":6,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"},{"id":34,"name":"Android"},{"id":39,"name":"iOS"}],"screenshots":[{"id":600075,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sccv0r.jpg"},{"id":600076,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sccv0s.jpg"},{"id":600078,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sccv0u.jpg"},{"id":600080,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sccv0w.jpg"},{"id":600083,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sccv0z.jpg"},{"id":600084,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sccv10.jpg"},{"id":600086,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sccv12.jpg"},{"id":600088,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sccv14.jpg"}],"summary":"In the near future, a technology called Brain-Machine Interface connects the brain and machines.

A blend of exciting arcade style combat and stealth mechanics packed with amazing graphics in a moody, immersive setting, Batman: Arkham Asylum offers diverse gameplay options that push the envelope for all action, adventure and superhero games.\n'Batman: Arkham Asylum' game logo\nBatman in hand to hand combat in 'Batman: Arkham Asylum'\nKick it in combat gameplay.\nView larger.\nBatman gliding in on an enemy in 'Batman: Arkham Asylum'\nAnd stealth action.\nView larger.\nThe Joker in 'Batman: Arkham Asylum'\nMatch wits with The Joker.\nView larger.\nThe batarang in flight in 'Batman: Arkham Asylum'\nUtilize utility belt gadgets.\nView larger.\nThe huge Killer Croc in 'Batman: Arkham Asylum'\nTake on dangerous bosses.\nView larger.\nStory\nBatman: Arkham Asylum features an original story penned exclusively for the game by famous Batman author and five-time Emmy award winner, Paul Dini, whose credits include \"Lost\" season one and \"Batman: The Animated Series.\" As the game begins Batman is personally delivering his nemesis, The Joker, to the asylum at Arkham Island, but he is uneasy. Although the Arkham asylum is well fortified, he has a nagging feeling that all is not well, which proves to be the case when seconds after turning The Joker over to the guards, the master criminal breaks free of his captors. Even more surprising than this quick turn of events is the revelation that it was never The Joker's intent to escape the vault-like facility, but instead to trap Batman there. Surrounded by an asylum full of dangerous criminals, many of which he put there and all at the beck and call of the Joker, can Batman survive and discover what is behind the Joker's intricate plot?\n\nGameplay\nIn Batman: Arkham Asylum players strap on the gadget-heavy utility belt of the Caped Crusader. Gameplay here is a combination of both the knuckle crunching rush of hand to hand combat as you take on the hordes of thugs that infest Arkham Asylum, and stealth gameplay in which you must dispatch individuals from the shadows. Players can expect an engrossing single player campaign in which Batman continually moves forward to face the henchmen, bosses and traps that The Joker has set for him. With regards to opponents, in addition to The Joker who you will hear more than you see, the dark walls of Arkham also hold familiar villains from the the Batman criminal universe including Harley Quinn, Victor Zsasz and Killer Croc, that you will have to deal with, but don't expect a one-dimensional experience. As players progress from environment to environment within Arkham they will have to use varying combinations of muscle, detective skills, gadgetry and a certain degree of light RPG-like leveling of Batman's skills, arsenal and physical characteristics to survive and discover what The Joker's underlying scheme is.\n\nIn addition to the story-driven single player campaign Arkham Asylum also contains various additional play modes. These include an arcade styled combat mode where players accumulate points by engaging hordes of thugs in a hand to hand slugfest across a series of maps, in which Batman's physical strength and agility play a major role. The key here is to chain together as many attacks as possible due to the fact that with each successful combo players increase the point multiplier associated with their actions. The game also features a time-based stealth mode where players must hone their ability to strike silently from the shadows. This gameplay, referred to as 'Invisible Predator' utilizes the Dark Knight's skill with gadgets like the grapple tool, batarang and explosives. These allow for vertical/horizontal mobility, the ability to quickly strike from above and at a distance and to take out enemies and create distractions, even through walls. But remember that Batman works solo and is not superhuman. Your enemies will congregate around trouble areas and work as a team against you, so you must be silent, plan your attacks wisely, strike quickly and discover the value of encouraging fear within enemies.\n\nKey Features\n\nUtilize the unique FreeFlow combat system to chain together unlimited combos seamlessly and battle with huge groups of The Joker's henchmen in brutal melee brawls.\nInvestigate as Batman, the world's greatest detective, by solving intricate puzzles with the help of cutting edge forensic tools including x-ray scanning, fingerprint scans, 'Amido Black' spray and a pheromone tracker.\nFace off against Gotham's greatest villains including The Joker, Harley Quinn, Victor Zsasz and Killer Croc.\nBecome the Invisible Predator with Batman's fear takedowns and unique vantage point system to move without being seen and hunt enemies.\nChoose multiple takedown methods, including swooping from the sky and smashing through walls, and use the predator camera get a closer look at the action.\nExplore every inch of Arkham Asylum and roam freely on the infamous island, presented for the first time ever in its gritty and realistic entirety.\nExperience what it's like to be Batman using batarangs, explosive gel aerosol, the Batclaw, sonar resonator and the line launcher.\nUnlock more secrets by completing hidden challenges in the world and develop and customize equipment by earning experience points.\nEnjoy complete superhero freedom in the environment with the use of Batman's grapple to get to any place you can see, jump from any height and glide in any direction.","tags":[1,23,38,43,268435481,268435487,536871383,536871395,536873689,536889383,536895231,536896832],"videos":[{"id":39966,"video_id":"uPnTSvX86Dw"}]},{"id":912,"aggregated_rating":84.6,"cover":{"id":162573,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co3hfx.jpg"},"name":"Tomb Raider","platforms":[{"id":6,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"},{"id":7,"name":"PlayStation"},{"id":9,"name":"PlayStation 3"},{"id":13,"name":"PC DOS"},{"id":32,"name":"Sega Saturn"},{"id":38,"name":"PlayStation Portable"},{"id":42,"name":"N-Gage"},{"id":46,"name":"PlayStation Vita"}],"screenshots":[{"id":552491,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scbuaz.jpg"},{"id":552492,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scbub0.jpg"},{"id":552493,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scbub1.jpg"},{"id":552494,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scbub2.jpg"},{"id":552495,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scbub3.jpg"},{"id":552496,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scbub4.jpg"},{"id":552497,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scbub5.jpg"}],"summary":"Tomb Raider is a 3D action game developed by Core Design and published by Eidos Interactive.

Taking a unique and meta approach towards the Gundam universe, Gundam Breaker 3 continues the formula of bringing about action-packed mecha on mecha battles that revolve around one of the core aspects of the series: Gunpla aka Gundam Model Kits! For those new to this specific spin-off, the core mechanics revolve around the creative choice of building your own Gundam based on the many real life parts featured in the game; the previous title, Gundam Breaker 2, included over 100 Gunpla kits to choose form, which massively increased the number of options and customizations available to a total of over 10,000,000,000 different options! Customization is a big part of the Gundam Breaker series and the upcoming release will channel that mindset by allowing players more to choose from when it comes to Gunpla colors, as well as the plating coating and dirtiness, and the expression of damage. In addition to missile pods, rail cannons, beam launchers, and other weapons, there is expansion equipment with various abilities that can be equipped. This will allow players to create a Full Armor Mobile Suit of their own! The SD (Super Deformed) series of Gundam will now also be available in support roles, who will take instructions from the player during battles.

Players use the stylus to point at oncoming zombies on the bottom screen. Pointing fires the weapon Steiner has equipped. Shots can be delivered to the head, arms, legs, and stomach.\n\nTo reload, players must simply grab a clip icon (located in the bottom right hand corner of the touch screen), and drag it to the bottom left hand corner which has an image of the 'magazine'.\n\nThe D-pad and face buttons of the console are simply used to switch weapons. Both serve the same purpose, and work for both right-handed and left-handed players.\n\nHealth and ammunition can be recovered by shooting crates and cabinets. The player also has the option of shooting switches to open doors and choose a left or right path when a fork appears. Either path chosen will still yield the same bonuses.","tags":[1,19,536870918,536872032,536872232,536872748,536875242,536875358,536875422,536877306]},{"id":140472,"cover":{"id":124678,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co2o7a.jpg"},"name":"Tree of Life: Oddria!","platforms":[{"id":6,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}],"screenshots":[{"id":405982,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc8p9a.jpg"},{"id":405983,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc8p9b.jpg"},{"id":421866,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc91ii.jpg"},{"id":421867,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc91ij.jpg"},{"id":421868,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc91ik.jpg"},{"id":421869,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc91il.jpg"},{"id":421870,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc91im.jpg"},{"id":421871,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc91in.jpg"},{"id":421872,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc91io.jpg"},{"id":421873,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc91ip.jpg"}],"summary":"The journey begins once again.

The main portion of the game is Tour mode, where the player visits a series of different levels representing different countries of the world. Each player's character is armed with a gun, which shoots a vertical cable. If this hits a bubble, it will cause it to split in two. Upgrades allow two cables to be shot at once, or the ability to stick a cable to the ceiling where it will cling for a few seconds, bursting any bubble that hits it.\n\nPlayers must clear each screen of bubbles before progressing to the next one. The largest bubbles will have 4 degrees of splitting before clearing. Many level layouts have ladders, barriers and breakable bricks in part of the screen, affecting movement of both the player and the bubbles. Faster bubbles in the shape of diamonds also bounce around the screen going any which way rather than bouncing in predictable arcs like the other bubbles.\n\nSeveral power-up tokens are also available, offering features such as splitting all bubbles down to their minimal size, freezing the bubbles for a few seconds, and various different weapons. Monsters also enter the screen periodically, which hit the bubbles and take them down a size, and can often be directed by the cable weapon.\n\nIn addition to the main Tour mode, the game also features Panic mode, in which a succession of bubbles are thrown at at the players. As the player progresses, the amount of bubbles required to reach the next level also increases, similar to scoring on Tetris.","tags":[1,268435465,536871078,536872211,536873064,536875056,536875072,536875076,536875201,536875229,536875489,536875666,536876120,536876216,536876542,536877570,536878192],"videos":[{"id":49244,"video_id":"1iHR7pHMs-M"}]},{"id":197543,"cover":{"id":217480,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co4nt4.jpg"},"name":"Hatsumira: From the Future Undying","platforms":[{"id":6,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"},{"id":46,"name":"PlayStation Vita"}],"screenshots":[{"id":776853,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scgnf9.jpg"},{"id":776854,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scgnfa.jpg"},{"id":776855,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scgnfb.jpg"},{"id":776856,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scgnfc.jpg"},{"id":776857,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scgnfd.jpg"},{"id":776858,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scgnfe.jpg"},{"id":776859,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scgnff.jpg"},{"id":776860,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scgnfg.jpg"},{"id":776861,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scgnfh.jpg"},{"id":776862,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scgnfi.jpg"},{"id":776865,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scgnfl.jpg"},{"id":776869,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scgnfp.jpg"},{"id":776870,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scgnfq.jpg"},{"id":776871,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scgnfr.jpg"},{"id":776872,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scgnfs.jpg"},{"id":776874,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scgnfu.jpg"},{"id":776875,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scgnfv.jpg"}],"summary":"From the development team behind the Grisaia series, Hatsumira -From the Future Undying- is a fantasy visual novel that transports you into a whole new world filled with swords and sorcery!","tags":[42,268435487,536870990,536871255,536872873,536874498]},{"id":140372,"cover":{"id":118194,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co2j76.jpg"},"name":"HOUSE","platforms":[{"id":6,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}],"screenshots":[{"id":405640,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc8ozs.jpg"},{"id":405641,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc8ozt.jpg"},{"id":405659,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc8p0b.jpg"}],"summary":"HOUSE is a survival-horror game where you play as a young girl exploring an ever-changing HOUSE.","tags":[1,19,21,268435465,268435487,268435488,536872032,536887612],"videos":[{"id":57699,"video_id":"S-M6p01gRCw"}]},{"id":20072,"aggregated_rating":50.0,"cover":{"id":23237,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/vx9vyjyj7y5ffaovjnla.jpg"},"name":"Valhalla Knights 3","platforms":[{"id":46,"name":"PlayStation Vita"}],"screenshots":[{"id":117219,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/w5stiu7lu1qy7bnh2zbf.jpg"},{"id":117220,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/ncigti3sno5r4qtlp5n5.jpg"},{"id":117221,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/ueewlwwbgpzujk5el4b6.jpg"},{"id":117222,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/vwytr7xtxks6rglfeocw.jpg"},{"id":117223,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/w25xoccmkjwqyqczdwas.jpg"}],"summary":"Valhalla Knights 3 marks the return of the gritty action RPG series, now taking full advantage of the powerful PS Vita hardware to provide intense real-time battle and smooth seven-on-seven party-based combat.

Magical Drop Plus 1! was released in North America and Europe as \"Chain Reaction\"; in this version, the puzzle pieces are changed from spherical Drops to various items (such as food or celestial bodies) and the character-unique voice acting is replaced by a single male narrator.\n\nAll versions of the original arcade game were developed for Data East's \"MLC\" arcade hardware.\n\nThe game includes two game modes: the one-player score-based Solo Play (where additional lines of tiles regularly drop from the top of the screen) and two-player competitive Battle Mode (where the second player can be human or CPU opponents). Similar to Tetris Attack, players can make \"chain reactions\" by quickly creating near-simultaneous matches to either boost their score (in Solo Play) or fill up more of their opponent's playfield (in Battle Mode).\n\nMagical Drop was ported to the Super Famicom, which includes a puzzle mode that challenges players to solve preset puzzles given a limited number of possible moves. The game was re-imagined for the Sony PlayStation and Sega Saturn with different, pre-rendered characters. The Sega Saturn port was going to be released in America by Koei, and appeared at E3 1997, however the American release was cancelled. Finally, a port of the game is part of Magical Drop III + Wonderful; this includes the PAL version of III + Wonderful, which retains the Magical Drop Plus 1! name as opposed to using Chain Reaction.","tags":[17,268435465,268435469,268435471,536872060,536874694,536875472,536900657,536901515,536901516,536902076],"videos":[{"id":54771,"video_id":"sYWNFrXdl8E"},{"id":54772,"video_id":"4H1-sFhWUXs"},{"id":54773,"video_id":"DAEx55q8h-8"}]},{"id":7464,"aggregated_rating":79.0,"cover":{"id":115375,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co2h0v.jpg"},"name":"Tales of Symphonia Chronicles","platforms":[{"id":9,"name":"PlayStation 3"}],"screenshots":[{"id":15463,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/v2eegctacoqkwippkbj7.jpg"},{"id":15464,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/panlw8ra8iyk1ze9xq7r.jpg"},{"id":15465,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/xqmgtgxfszkru5udz6ps.jpg"},{"id":15466,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/p4zx6jxykjdf2bc3o7xo.jpg"},{"id":15467,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/etalwffmwsrmy94pvunu.jpg"}],"summary":"Tales of Symphonia Chronicles is a compilation release of Tales of Symphonia and Tales of Symphonia: Dawn of the New World HD remasters with additional content.","tags":[1,268435468,536870990,536871208,536871433,536871504,536871872,536871938,536872205,536872235,536872587,536872665,536872780,536872978,536873154,536873384,536875153,536875157,536875259,536875265,536875380,536875437,536875755,536875764,536875830,536876007,536876095,536876241,536876607,536876650,536877383,536877560,536877593,536877594,536877595,536877596,536877597,536877598,536877599,536877600,536877601,536877602],"videos":[{"id":10418,"video_id":"_K-bRrxOMcI"}]},{"id":147680,"cover":{"id":165994,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co3k2y.jpg"},"name":"Get 10 quest","platforms":[{"id":49,"name":"Xbox One"},{"id":130,"name":"Nintendo Switch"}],"screenshots":[{"id":448058,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc9lq2.jpg"},{"id":448060,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc9lq4.jpg"},{"id":448063,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc9lq7.jpg"},{"id":448064,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc9lq8.jpg"},{"id":448065,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc9lq9.jpg"}],"summary":"80 levels, 6 different gameplay and the original endless mode.","tags":[268435465,268435471,268435489]},{"id":60357,"cover":{"id":127516,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co2qe4.jpg"},"name":"ICBM","platforms":[{"id":6,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}],"screenshots":[{"id":504442,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scat8a.jpg"},{"id":504444,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scat8c.jpg"},{"id":504446,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scat8e.jpg"},{"id":504448,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scat8g.jpg"},{"id":504454,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scat8m.jpg"},{"id":504457,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scat8p.jpg"},{"id":504460,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scat8s.jpg"},{"id":504461,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scat8t.jpg"}],"summary":"NOVEMBER 5TH, 1983.
