Only by sinking enemy bosses do players move to the next level - and they encounter some familiar faces along the way. The dreaded Pooka and Fygar are back to threaten Dig Dug, along with a host of never-before-seen bosses. Dig Dug is armed with a series of thrilling weapons to combat monsters as well as elements from the environment including rolling rocks, quicksand and flowing lava.",

In Karmaflow, the game’s story is presented entirely in the form of a rock opera, sung by some of the world’s most talented rock voices.\n\nKarmaflow: The Rock Opera Videogame is a puzzle platformer featuring music performed by various musicians. Simone Simons (Epica), Dani Filth (Cradle of Filth), Marc Hudson (Dragonforce), Tony Kakko (Sonata Artica) and Alissa White-Gluz (Arch Enemy) all have lent their vocal talents to Karmaflow, along with the Metropole Orkest (the world’s biggest – Grammy-award winning – professional pop and jazz orchestra) working on the game’s score.\n\nThe aesthetic of Karmaflow is inspired by games such as the Zelda-series, Journey and the darker tone of Darksiders. The first world starts out rather dark and mysterious, while the third world has got plenty of crimson and its character design is directly influenced by the culture and legends of the Tibetan people. The sung narrative itself will have real depth and cover fascinating themes such as balance and contradictions.",

Scarlet, Violet, and Orange—the vampires divided into three houses, but you feel a strange sense of intensity. And then you remember. \n \n—Who you are, and who they are. \n \nThe vampires whose memories have gone astray, who forgot their original selves and live with false brethren. They accept this situation as reality. No matter how much you try to appeal to them, your words do not reach them. Your beloved, their memories with you forgotten, heartlessly draw near. Every day, you have no choice but to watch them kill each other, blood-lust and snarling. In this closed world with no escape, can these broken gears really be stopped? This is the twisted “Blood Lineage” of the vampires that you follow.",

The two male and two female characters have different strengths and weaknesses, which can be offset to a degree by leveling up. Experience points earned in combat can be used to improve a character\u0027s attributes and fighting skills. \n \nWhen firearms and ammo are in limited supply, you\u0027ll be able to engage enemies in hand-to-hand combat with axes, machetes, knives, clubs, and similar edged or bludgeoning weapons that will degrade over time. Explore the island\u0027s urban areas, forests, mountain highlands, caves, beaches, and other locales from a first-person perspective, or utilize an over-the-shoulder view for melee combat. \n \nThe \"Game of the Year Edition\" for Xbox 360 includes new blueprints and weapons, the original Dead Island, and its two main DLC releases: the multiplayer \"Bloodbath Arena\" and the single-player \"Ryder White\" campaign.",

    "summary": "An eager soldier, Fatima Daoud’s ambition and ability got her noticed by M.A.Y.H.E.M. who recruited her as a field agent. Under the codename Dynamo, she worked for the agency as an advanced scout for new cities to determine the extent of L.E.G.I.O.N. activity. However, L.E.G.I.O.N. found Dynamo and led her into a trapped laboratory which was buried in a vault deep underground. An explosion left Dynamo with serious injuries, almost killing her. While she began to bleed out, Ariadne, unbeknownst to Dynamo, sauntered in and flipped a coin. The result was Ariadne injecting Dynamo with experimental nanites. The nanites rebuilt Dynamo into a merging of woman and machine, the next step along the evolutionary ladder. She was presumed dead by M.A.Y.H.E.M., though upon returning to The A.R.K. Persephone renamed her Lazarus and she rejoined the other agents in the field.\n\nLazarus is on a constant quest to prove that she’s the top rung of the evolutionary ladder. As an agent of M.A.Y.H.E.M., she encounters an endless stream of competitors ready to challenge her for that distinction. While she’s evolved beyond her own humanity, she still has a great love and respect for humankind as a whole. M.A.Y.H.E.M. allows her to watch over those quirky human beings whose flaws and peculiarities continue to fascinate her to this day.",

The game was developed by Maurice Guégan of Stabyourself.net, who has previously worked on parody games such as Not Tetris. Mari0 was developed with the LÖVE framework, and is cross-platform. The game was released on March 3, 2012 for Windows, Mac OS X, and Linux under a Creative Commons license (BY-NC-SA). The source code is also available to download.\nThe core game of Mari0 plays directly from the 8-bit Super Mario Bros. 2D platform game, where the player controls Mario via the keyboard, running and jumping through levels, avoiding or jumping on enemies to defeat them, while collecting coins to earn points towards their score. The game adds the concept of the \"portal gun\" from the Portal series; the player can click with the mouse device on two separate surfaces on the level to create a portal between them. This can be used for a number of gameplay options, often using vertical momentum entering one portal to \"fling\" the Mario character horizontally out of the other portal, but will also affect enemies and other game elements in similar manners.\nThe core game uses the level designs from the original Super Mario Bros. as well as sets of test chambers inspired by Portal \u0027​s Aperture Science, but a level editor, along with different graphic sets and shaders are provided to create new content. Up to four players can cooperatively play in the game. Online multiplayer is to be released in a future version.",

    "summary": "The first two games in the Wild Arms series garnered attention and acclaim as they brought classic console role-playing to the original PlayStation. Though crafted in the same story-telling spirit, Wild Arms 3 (titled Wild Arms Advanced 3rd in Japan) boasts major technological improvements and a number of new gameplay elements. Featuring \"stroke-shaded\" animation-style graphics, a \"Wild West\" setting, and a completely 3D game engine (not just for battles, as in the previous games), Wild Arms 3 is designed to make good use of the power of the PlayStation 2.\n\nWild Arms 3 features four main characters and takes the time to let players become acquainted with each of them. The \"drifters\" Virginia, Gallows, Jet, and Clive are four very different adventurers whose paths intertwine toward a shared destiny. Though each has his or her own personal motivations, all four seek an explanation for why the once-verdant lands of Filgaia have become dry and barren. Differences must be overcome and the characters must act in harmony if they are to truly understand the ancient mystical forces at work.\n\nAs the drifters move through the desolate land of Filgaia, they are challenged with a number of mysteries to solve and barriers to overcome. The different special abilities of each character must be used to solve different parts of the game\u0027s complex puzzles. A technique dubbed \"expressive communication\" is designed to allow players to quickly gauge the moods and emotions of the onscreen characters. Monsters, villains, and other horrible creatures stand between the drifters and their destinations as well. The Wild Arms 3 turn-based battle system is designed to offer players an intricate level of control, allowing tactics that make wise use of the various powers and weaponry of the drifters while presenting combat with cinematic flair.\n\nWild Arms 3 delivers everything RPG gamers expect: an in-depth storyline, puzzling dungeons \u0026 a unique battling system. Journey along with Virginia, Jet, Clive and Gallows and discover the mystery behind the Prophets to revive the memories of Filgaia. Explore dungeons to unlock secret pathways and find mythical treasures. Gun Blazing shoot-outs deliver intense cinematic battles. Wild Arms 3 embodies tried-and-true elements of a role-playing classic.",

You have a set amount of time to train and prepare for the fight against trillion to defend the underworld. You can train stats, learn skills, go into a dungeon to gather items, strengthen weapons, and rest to get rid of fatigue. You can also interact with the Overlord to raise affection points, raise affection to a certain level and events related to the Overlord will occur.\n\nAffection points are also used in the battle against Trillion where they act as a buffer for your health and mana. As long as you still have affection points in the battle you will also have the option to retreat from the battle, giving up a section of the underworld for more time to train. If the Overlords health reaches 0 they will be able to activate a final death skill that could deal massive damage, seal one of Trillion\u0027s attacks, or stop Trillion\u0027s advance for a longer training period. The Overlords items, equipment, and seals will be passed on to the next Overlord you train along with a portion experience.",

This game also features the longest most involved storyline of any Monster Rancher game to date. \n \nYour goal is to raise monsters to win in-game tournaments, explore for items, and improve your ranch. You can also test your raising skills by battling your monsters against a friend in 2P mode. \n \nThe game still uses the innovative system of having a player insert music CDs, game discs, or DVDs into the PS2 to be read and used in making monsters. If you have a good sized collection of music, games, or movies, you can have access to a large variety of monsters very fast.",

Players can also cooperate in Ad-Hoc while gunning down hordes of humorous foes using familiar weapons in seven distinct levels that will see our heroes traverse deserts, mountains, caves and lava pits to finally put an end to their longtime enemy.\n\nThis revised version includes additional content including co-op multiplayer and downloadable content, as well as the character Leona Heidern.",

The game has been split up in a Campaign Mode, in which you take on all levels of the Monster Coliseum on your own, a Free Battle Mode where you play skirmish matches against enemies defeated in the campaign, and a versus mode to take on a human opponent. Before starting, you have to choose a symbol, assign parameters to it (based on monster points, action points and power points) and buy a starter kit card deck. \n \nIn a typical campaign game, you start in the entrance hall, where you manage your cards and monsters. To duel, you choose one of the four areas with five levels each, and defeat the opponents. New monsters are acquired by winning the match. The turn-based duels are played as a card game. Both characters start with a deck of cards and a number of health points. When a health status reaches zero, the battle is over. You attack your opponent by summoning monsters and assigning abilities to them. Trick cards can be used to gain both offensive and defensive advantages. Before each duel, you have to pick a monster that is up for ante, and the fighting is influenced by various parameters, including the land form you are playing on.",

Each phrase entered will create a unique monster, which will always appear when that specific phrase is entered. Players can experiment with many different phrases for unexpected results. Two separate monsters can also be combined with special items to form an entirely new monster. Certain combinations will lead to hidden, rare monsters which can not be obtained through the normal monster generation process.\n\nThe Coaching System from Monster Rancher Advance has been dramatically improved for added depth in the sequel. Depending on the monster type, certain coaches will offer unique training sessions which other monster coaches will not be able to provide. These special training sessions can be very difficult and dangerous, yet have potential to yield major results. A monster\u0027s charisma and skills will also be crucial factors in deciding whether it is suitable to be a good coach or not. Coaches will now recognize and alert you to certain warnings which your breeding assistant may not notice.",

When a marble runs over certain sections of the puzzle, the paths may be rerouted or cut off, either temporarily or permanently.

The game’s design is not for the faint of heart as players will need to traverse the underworld, combat skillful undead, and best unforgiving bosses. The epic story follows Andronikos, the resurrected King of the Underworld and the embodiment of the Deathbat, who is tasked with reclaiming the lands of Haides from the despotic Dark Andronikos. Along the way you’ll mix and match brutal melee combat with projectile magic attacks battling through beautifully designed and hellish landscapes inspired by the band’s iconic discography and artwork. Interact with characters along the way to solve puzzles and unlock the mysteries of Moros Island.",

    "summary": "Toy Soldiers: War Chest is similar to the previous games where players prevent enemy units from reaching the toybox by building and upgrading turrets. In War Chest, turrets can be improved by upgrading armor, fire rate and damage separately. The enemy AI is improved as well. For example destroying a bridge will cause ground units to take a different path to the toybox. Certain units have the ability to heal nearby units and some will focus on destroying any placed turrets.\n\nBarrages and playable units from Toy Soldiers: Cold War returns with a few changes. Instead of earning killstreaks or destroying a specially marked enemy unit, the game uses a bar that fills up when killing enemy units. When the bar is filled to a certain amount, a special ability can used to call in barrages or spawn a hero unit such a zeppelin that performs a bombing run.\n\nThe game features 4 highly customizable armies (8 in Hall of Fame Edition). Players can choose which turrets to deploy, barrages and modify the hero\u0027s arsenal. As the game progresses, new customization options will become available.\n\nThe Hall of Fame Edition features four additional licensed armies based on fictional characters. This includes Duke and Cobra Commander from G.I. Joe, Ezio Auditore da Firenze from Assassin\u0027s Creed and He-Man from Masters of the Universe. The characters can be purchased separately or as a bundle on the standard version.",

The player controls the character with arrow keys and types the desired action using the parser.\n\nThe game focuses on a morbid atmosphere and on violence with many nasty and gory situations in it.

The basic gist of Arcade mode is a score attack mechanic where you want to survive to level 100 with the highest score. Fight back a never ending spawn of game pieces by making matches of 3 or more before the board fills up, or even worse, you are killed by one of the traps that could spawn at any moment. There are some things to make it not so hopeless; like some pickups, bombs and even extra lives.",

When he encounters these enemies as a cub, his roar does little to scare them off. However, maturing into a majestic lion deepens his voice and makes the growl useful as a weapon. As he explores the nine levels, Simba will be able to collect a wide variety of items that will open several bonuses that include puzzles, mini-games, and movies. While the film was animated in 2D, Simba and his world are rendered in three dimensions, and the plot unfolds in cinematic sequences between each level.

The player\u0027s \"hand\" has a limited number of slots available, and if the player fills it up with pieces that don\u0027t match then they have failed. There is also a timer for the whole round that ticks down whenever the player is deliberating on their next move, and removing pairs of pieces from play will slightly refill it. There are also special power-up tiles that increase the timer.\n\nAs with mahjong solitaire, the player can only match identical tiles. The exception are the eight unique season and flower tiles, which can be paired off with any other season or flower (though it has to be two seasons or two flowers).",

    "summary": "Throughout Ace Combat 6, the player must pilot a fighter jet or other aircraft to destroy foes both in the air and on the ground. As an arcade flight game, it simplifies flight controls and gives the player a large amount of bullets, missiles and other weapons, putting them up against a very large amount of enemy forces. In addition to missiles and a vulcan cannon, the player can equip special weapons such as heat-seeking missiles, bombs, rocket launchers, and others. The player can lock on to a number of foes, and assist different tactical squads by switching between their respective HUD readouts.\n\nThe game includes 4 default multiplayer modes: Battle Royale, Siege Battle, Team Battle, and Co-Op Battle. In Battle Royale, the basic Deathmatch game mode, up to sixteen players shoot each other down to earn the highest points at the time limit. In Team Battle, a basic Team Deathmatch game is created. Points are awarded based on the type of aircraft destroyed. A unique type of multiplayer game, Siege Battle is played with two teams, Attacking and Defending. The Attacking team attempts to destroy the target (usually heavily defended by flak) within the time limit. The Defending team tries to halt their attack. The co-op battle mode consists of two single-player missions without AI that can be played with up to three other players.",

    "summary": "Eternal Darkness: Sanity\u0027s Requiem is a psychological horror action adventure, released in 2002 by Nintendo for the Gamecube. It tells the stories of twelve characters that span across the world and two millennia who have to deal with ancient forces of evil which have been trying to manifest themselves in our world. Chapters take place in Ancient Rome, Persia, the Middle East, and modern-day Rhode Island. Throughout the game, the protagonists will have access to several weapons appropriate for their era, from bastard sword \u0026 gladius to flintlock pistol and shotgun.\n\nThe game features an involved Magic system, which allows different spells to be created through the combination of runes. These spells can attack enemies, dispel illusions, and heal both the body and items.\n\nEternal Darkness: Sanity\u0027s Requiem also has a unique feature called Sanity. If an enemy sees a character, their Sanity meter drops. When Sanity gets low, hallucinations begin to plague the character. Walls bleed, voices whisper from nowhere, the camera gets disoriented. Sanity can be restored by dealing a finishing move on a dying enemy, or with spells or some items.",

Needless to say, it is up to the player to stop Klogg and his devious plans. \n \nMuch like The Neverhood, Skullmonkeys is a 2D platformer built entirely of Claymation characters, enemies, and environments. Throughout the game\u0027s seven worlds spanning ninety levels, the basic objective of each is to destroy as many Skullmonkeys as possible. Destroying the simians can be done one of two ways: firing projectile weapons or butt-bouncing off their heads.",
