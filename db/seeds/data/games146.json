The game also features 51 tracks, many of which are new or modified versions of old Gran Turismo favorites, with some notable real-world additions.","tags":[1,268435466,268435469,536870940,536871183,536871313,536872060,536872152,536872321,536872590,536872656,536872695,536872842,536872983,536873390,536874337,536874822,536875061,536875069,536875117,536875128,536875133,536875194,536875207,536875242,536875271,536875356,536875364,536875385,536875559,536875692,536875955,536876108,536876314,536876465,536876484,536876666,536876701,536876786,536876787,536876790,536876795,536877039,536877049,536877318,536877744,536877983,536878111,536878319,536878545,536879167,536879193,536879647,536879989,536880024,536880193,536880441,536880875,536881253,536881348,536881349,536881377,536881382,536881407,536881976,536881977,536882050,536882177,536882304,536883082,536884022,536884027,536884430,536884431,536885091,536885092,536885093,536885095,536885103,536885819,536886261,536886262,536886263,536886264],"videos":[{"id":1021,"video_id":"3EsVfR7aKoY"},{"id":5184,"video_id":"lZvg1pa1lYw"}]},{"id":32594,"cover":{"id":191796,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co43zo.jpg"},"name":"The NADI Project","platforms":[{"id":3,"name":"Linux"},{"id":6,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"},{"id":14,"name":"Mac"}],"screenshots":[{"id":55204,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/jhqoiqtpu5usidn6un3w.jpg"},{"id":55205,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/rji4hnypnormqpfsjbyi.jpg"},{"id":55206,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/nihfekicerfu9pmq5axc.jpg"},{"id":55207,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/lpuri9c6f9ew9uayfygg.jpg"},{"id":55208,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/ww1cmthqg7oz2w3jqzf7.jpg"}],"summary":"The NADI Project it is a first person graphic adventure, in which you will face various obstacles to escape from your destiny.","tags":[268435487,268435488,536871939]},{"id":136415,"cover":{"id":111961,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co2ee1.jpg"},"name":"Agony of a Dying MMO","platforms":[{"id":6,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}],"screenshots":[{"id":394644,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc8gic.jpg"},{"id":394645,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc8gid.jpg"},{"id":394646,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc8gie.jpg"},{"id":394647,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc8gif.jpg"},{"id":394648,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc8gig.jpg"},{"id":394649,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc8gih.jpg"},{"id":394650,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc8gii.jpg"},{"id":394651,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc8gij.jpg"}],"summary":"Agony of a Dying MMO is a narrative horror game that takes place in the final hours of a massively multiplayer online game before its servers shut down for good leaving behind a dedicated, but divided community of players.","tags":[1,19,268435487,268435488,536871043,536871434,536873137,536873338],"videos":[{"id":64022,"video_id":"lTTOZZb1pJY"}]},{"id":27258,"aggregated_rating":76.75,"cover":{"id":200221,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co4ahp.jpg"},"name":"Culdcept Revolt","platforms":[{"id":37,"name":"Nintendo 3DS"}],"screenshots":[{"id":125714,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/n8lmpeispgxifd30hvky.jpg"},{"id":155811,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/d1pyinggwy5ljwuonhjl.jpg"},{"id":155812,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/gey2yzxacyiry9zjkx8a.jpg"},{"id":155813,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/mbbxr39xxdqyqauy7y0r.jpg"},{"id":155814,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/hkejzb7em0vs7oicpocn.jpg"}],"summary":"\"A world of strategy awaits.\n\nAs the Culdcept series celebrates its 20th Anniversary, the addictive card game-meets-board game is back, bigger and better than ever with hundreds of new cards, inventive boards, and exciting multiplayer!

The game uses two different modes: Arcade Mode and Gran Turismo Mode. In the arcade mode, the player can freely choose vehicles they wish to use, and can enable damage. However, the Gran Turismo Mode requires the player to earn driver's licenses, pay for vehicles, and earn trophies in order to unlock new courses. Gran Turismo 2 features nearly 650 automobiles and 27 racing tracks, including rally tracks. Compared with Gran Turismo, the gameplay, physics and graphics are very similar. The major changes are the vastly expanded number of cars, tracks and races in simulation mode. Other differences include that the player can race events separately, if they don't want to enter the whole tournament. The player is no longer able to \"qualify\" for each race entered.","tags":[32,268435466,268435469,536871067,536871313,536871396,536871690,536871807,536872060,536872152,536872321,536872590,536872653,536872695,536872729,536872842,536872983,536873390,536874337,536875069,536875117,536875122,536875128,536875151,536875207,536875242,536875271,536875356,536875364,536875456,536875559,536875692,536875955,536876108,536876465,536876484,536876666,536876701,536876787,536876795,536877039,536877049,536877318,536877677,536877744,536878005,536878319,536879167,536879193,536879989,536880193,536880441,536880875,536881382,536881407,536881976,536882177,536882304,536883097,536884031,536884431,536884863,536885091,536885092,536885103,536885573,536885819,536886261,536886262,536886264,536886466,536886541],"videos":[{"id":7367,"video_id":"SPy0sPBVfhk"},{"id":40301,"video_id":"NC2qKy-WMf4"}]},{"id":31438,"cover":{"id":95694,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co21u6.jpg"},"name":"Alice's Patchworks 2","platforms":[{"id":6,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"},{"id":34,"name":"Android"}],"screenshots":[{"id":48182,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sqc4tq4nhuxq1zhcutw8.jpg"},{"id":48183,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/v3bs4lgg0yngx7su8v3t.jpg"},{"id":48184,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/gu5yecm7muajyieyuuix.jpg"},{"id":48185,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/fer9vzql6obskm9c0z1x.jpg"},{"id":48186,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/xblbghdtf3mssyxltggr.jpg"}],"summary":"Alice’s Patchwork 2 is a game of mosaic puzzles made of 6 different materials: wood, cloth, glass, paper, precious stones and metal.

The Emperor has crucified his four loyal heroes to a magic tree, driven by a maniac thirst for their immortality. Hundreds of years later, as only a ghost, he came to regret all the wrong deeds he has done and frees them, asking them to defeat his six former advisors in an attempt to undo what he has done.\n\nThis version of Gauntlet goes back to the roots: The warrior, valkyrie, elf, and wizard fight their way through hordes of enemies to make their way to the six bosses. The game is mostly a hack'n'slash affair, puzzles are limited to finding keys and pressing buttons that open doors and portals. Every character has a unique set of moves and attacks: The warrior has rather powerful attacks, the valkyrie has quick moves, the elf can shoot powerful arrows, and the wizard has several magical range attacks.\n\nDefeating enemies gives you experience points that may be used to increase your three stats; some chests in the levels contain better armor or weapons. Also, new moves can be purchased with gold.\n\nThe game can be played both in single-player as well as cooperative multi-player, where up to four players fight together.\n\nThe newest feature of this game (other than the much better graphics) is the online gaming feature. Played online, the game is identical to a regular multiplayer game, with each player on a different box.","tags":[1,268435481,268435487,536871208,536871301,536871470,536875198,536875304,536875331,536875361,536875496,536875610,536875611,536875639,536875699,536875738,536875802,536875803,536876489,536876695,536881347,536883028,536883778,536884021,536884207,536885061]},{"id":15267,"cover":{"id":114958,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co2gpa.jpg"},"name":"Moonfall","platforms":[{"id":6,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}],"screenshots":[{"id":64845,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/bpzc0hrdc4cgnhgceboe.jpg"},{"id":64846,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/jxhek675cs785tesbkqp.jpg"},{"id":64847,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/q10l1ihna7pq6j1hzuli.jpg"},{"id":64848,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/ggzive5br2zo1neznpqn.jpg"},{"id":64849,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/hscnyzkncp5t9ieftbr6.jpg"}],"summary":"Moonfall is a hand-painted side-scrolling 2D action RPG beat’em up set in an industrial gothic universe named Terra Nihil.

Like many villages, it has been tainted by modernity and economic failure; sallow youths hide in the shadows, losing their minds to chemical slime, while others simply disappear into the woods, never to be seen again. The elders of the village hide indoors, all too aware of the darkness that lurks outside. The once grand Train Station was the heart of the community, but only the very brave, or the very stupid, now approach the place. Adjoining the station is the Victorian Station Hotel. Once a haven for weary travelers and adulterous lovers, the hotel is now in ruins. Rot, decay and time are tearing this place to pieces. This, is where the Dark Fall flourishes.\n\nYou must watch your step, and never turn your back on the darkness.... Something evil, unknowable and hungry is hiding in the darkness of these old buildings. It wants your soul; to feed upon, devour and torture.

It was released on September 14, 2004 in North America. The game focuses on the final parts of the Dragon Ball Z series (season 7), namely the battles with Majin Buu. The game added several new additions to the series. First, the game added equipment, which could be equipped to characters to alter their stats and provide various other benefits. The game also allowed players to allocate their own stat points, of which three were given per level. Also added was the ability to block by holding the R button, and also to energy block by holding the B button while blocking. Using the energy block slowly drains the user's energy gauge. Both techniques greatly decrease the amount of damage that is received from attacks. The game also added various other features such as fusions and the ability to transform into a Super Saiyan 3. Although many features were added, the ability to use charge attacks by holding and releasing the A button was eliminated.\n\nThe dialogues used in the English edition of the game are very similar, and sometimes identical, to the ones used in the English dubbed animated series.","tags":[1,268435468,268435487,536870990,536871213,536871904,536871938,536871977,536872673,536873314,536873393,536873394,536875053,536875054,536875094,536875180,536875198,536875525,536875803,536875837,536875881,536875882,536875934,536876694,536877000,536877002,536877005,536877006,536877018,536877755,536878458,536879681,536880286,536880918,536881147,536884505,536885024]},{"id":96189,"cover":{"id":191780,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co43z8.jpg"},"name":"The Mirror's End","platforms":[{"id":6,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}],"screenshots":[{"id":209644,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/x5vw87rjohwv1rcemnoo.jpg"},{"id":209645,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/c6g89jzovg4at969lxle.jpg"},{"id":209646,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/gwcefr4tzvca3dkraxzr.jpg"}],"summary":"The Mirror's End is a top-down perspective adventure game with arcade elements, a sophisticated low-poly look and feel, and tons of retro gaming influences.","tags":[1,268435471,268435487,268435488,536875258]},{"id":6407,"aggregated_rating":63.3333333333333,"cover":{"id":6591,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/ziabz9meyocmriowlqux.jpg"},"name":"Fire Pro Wrestling","platforms":[{"id":24,"name":"Game Boy Advance"}],"screenshots":[{"id":26980,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/zhrpsbeeeevq328jtjx1.jpg"}],"summary":"Step into the Fire Pro Wrestling ring and experience blistering hot wrestling action that will blow you away!

But his reign of freedom doesn't last long. The Messian faith gains power, expanding the Cathedral into a new enclosed environment named Tokyo Millennium. The Gaians rise up, but their rebellion is repressed by the Messians' elite warrior class, the Temple Knights. People flock into the encapsulated city, submitting themselves to the strict hierarchy imposed by the Messian Center, where only the privileged living in the Center district are safe from demonic assaults.\n\nA few years later, a retired arena fighter Okamoto rescues a man named Hawk, who was fighting for his life against a demon. He trains him to fight in the arena of the Valhalla district, hoping that he would win the tournament, which will grant them both citizenship in the Center district. When Hawk succeeds, he is brought before a Messian bishop, and learns the shocking truth about his own origins and the role he is supposed to play in the grand scheme of events. A new battle for a better future begins.\n\nShin Megami Tensei II retains all the gameplay features of the previous game. The player is able to summon demons, fuse them to create more powerful ones, make them participate in battles, talk to random enemies and receive information from them, etc. The combat is turn-based, and the player explores the complex, maze-like dungeons from a first-person perspective view. Like in the first game, the Law, Chaos, and Neutral alignments play an important role: during the course of the game, the player will have to make choices that influence the alignment of the protagonist, steering the storyline into different directions.\n\nNew features include a \"magic succession\" system, which allows demons to carry over their original magic spells when they are fused into new ones, a few additional spells and abilities, and the possibility to play at the casino and win unique items.","tags":[17,18,20,39,268435468,536895433,536896177,536900657,536902076],"videos":[{"id":65545,"video_id":"tZ7Pq_yjorA"}]},{"id":11240,"aggregated_rating":80.0,"cover":{"id":129655,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co2s1j.jpg"},"name":"Joe Danger","platforms":[{"id":6,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"},{"id":9,"name":"PlayStation 3"},{"id":12,"name":"Xbox 360"},{"id":39,"name":"iOS"},{"id":46,"name":"PlayStation Vita"}],"screenshots":[{"id":101031,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/qxvawdfm0infdpgooxvm.jpg"},{"id":101032,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/l1fj2ineznf2iw8cfzzt.jpg"},{"id":101033,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/lap7w6s4orai7cmxxapr.jpg"},{"id":101034,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/idsyltm22s41atn8mp6p.jpg"},{"id":101035,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/pdvlqftvchq6pyl1efg8.jpg"}],"summary":"Can you put the world’s most determined stuntman back into the limelight?

Used in hatred, drenched in blood, the cursed blades condemn those who use them to tragedy, madness, and untimely deaths. As chaos spreads, denizens from the netherworld breach their realm as these malevolent swords summon evil spirits -- and the Dragon and Demon Gods as well. \nFeaturing hand-drawn 2D art reflecting the heritage and tone of the storyline, Muramasa: The Demon Blade transports players into a little known mythology, envisioned by the creators of the critically acclaimed Odin Sphere. Players take on the role of a male ninja or female kunoichi, utilizing their ninja prowess to traverse the clever side-scrolling levels that feature vertical progression as well as the traditional horizontal stage advancement.","tags":[1,268435468,268435487,536870928,536870973,536870988,536870990,536871049,536871076,536871088,536871138,536871139,536871165,536871208,536871244,536871301,536871389,536871470,536871581,536871670,536871865,536871945,536871971,536872225,536872339,536872617,536872622,536872793,536873023,536873208,536873370,536873591,536873863,536874398,536874688,536874745,536875057,536875074,536875089,536875196,536875198,536875200,536875262,536875298,536875316,536875320,536875377,536875383,536875436,536875453,536875494,536875525,536875590,536875638,536875778,536875808,536875830,536875872,536875934,536876057,536876220,536876240,536876266,536876329,536876496,536876607,536876752,536876758,536876853,536876876,536876878,536877016,536877035,536877383,536877612,536877752,536877778,536877779,536877813,536877850,536877956,536877997,536878132,536880021,536880046,536880051,536880227,536880359,536880812,536880843,536880987,536880988,536881238,536881315,536881578,536882306,536883865,536883980,536884486,536884736],"videos":[{"id":1309,"video_id":"rKl0o3B4Sr4"}]},{"id":36462,"aggregated_rating":65.3333333333333,"cover":{"id":99568,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co24ts.jpg"},"name":"Spellspire","platforms":[{"id":6,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"},{"id":46,"name":"PlayStation Vita"},{"id":48,"name":"PlayStation 4"},{"id":49,"name":"Xbox One"},{"id":130,"name":"Nintendo Switch"}],"screenshots":[{"id":63730,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/fmfk0wpplmtgexbbzv94.jpg"},{"id":63731,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/jxk7z78euwru3pewwnjc.jpg"},{"id":63732,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/psdpa0mielshrmuutlig.jpg"},{"id":63733,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/nf3aenb6wzjl3jgqyiwd.jpg"},{"id":63734,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/lj6fask11zwqit71rjal.jpg"},{"id":173488,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/o8jhug8wdeuvy2mbqtmd.jpg"},{"id":173489,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/jnqqam9zghpgthzo7jtw.jpg"},{"id":173490,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/cfqxmexruzmhcesn05km.jpg"},{"id":173491,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/e8poyqty47zsvkbj2nki.jpg"},{"id":173492,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/foew9ftzhxthnycgtnnn.jpg"},{"id":173493,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/cbhdqwmsfzah8nokvb2q.jpg"}],"summary":"Spellspire is a thrilling mashup of word game and action role playing game.

Besides platforming, the gameplay twist is the magic marker which introduces a creative and open approach to how puzzles can be solved.

Tree branches - You can grow trees to use them as platforms, springboards, rafts and moveable objects. Branches also catch fire.\n3. Vines which work like ropes. You can crawl and swing in vines, but vines can also be used to tie objects together.\n4. Water streams can be shaped freely and will move objects as well as Max along their path.\n5. You must destroy obstacles and defeat Mustacho’s minions.\n\nEach of the five powers are introduced in settings similar to the power themselves. The magic marker is triggered by pressing and holding RT and controlled by the right analog stick of the Xbox One controller and while controlling the magic marker Max cannot move at all.","tags":[1,268435464,268435465,268435487,536871075,536871737,536871931,536872070,536872205,536872695,536872961,536873787,536875046,536875060,536875073,536875089,536875090,536875109,536875209,536875228,536875229,536875340,536875440,536875500,536875650,536875700,536875745,536875802,536875808,536875937,536876218,536876486,536876572,536877726,536878215,536878406,536878407],"videos":[{"id":2504,"video_id":"_Y0cyo7u5gk"},{"id":16461,"video_id":"AQrurs5-U6c"}]},{"id":33406,"cover":{"id":125949,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co2p6l.jpg"},"name":"Maria the Witch","platforms":[{"id":6,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"},{"id":48,"name":"PlayStation 4"},{"id":49,"name":"Xbox One"},{"id":130,"name":"Nintendo Switch"}],"screenshots":[{"id":59317,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/rhuubfd5dp2iotau6ror.jpg"},{"id":59318,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/qvrdzk71lqlrre1rlkbb.jpg"},{"id":59319,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/ozi8bqsbmj2gu9yrlklr.jpg"},{"id":59320,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/btb4ymbiosngwlgl9af0.jpg"}],"summary":"Zaki&Mia stole all the mails and spread them all over the worlds !\nHelp Maria to bring them back to their owners !","tags":[1,17,268435464,268435487,268435488,268435489,536871208,536872070,536872961,536875046]},{"id":44794,"cover":{"id":51682,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/mxzsigidkltpiazqw0bx.jpg"},"name":"Ganbare Goemon: Ooedo Daikaiten","platforms":[{"id":7,"name":"PlayStation"}],"summary":"Ganbare Goemon: Ōedo Daikaiten is a Ganbare Goemon game released for the PlayStation on March 29, 2001.\n\nA villain named Ecorori kidnaps Omitsu, and it's up to Goemon and his crew to stop him.\n\nThe game is extremely similar to Ganbare Goemon 2 for Super Famicom and Goemon's Great Adventure/Mystical Ninja 2 in that there's mostly sidescrolling levels, accompanied by some Impact bosses.

Offbeat male and female characters of varying skill play for the Wild Cats, Pranksters, Heart Breakers, Ninjas, Snipers, Fireballs, Thunder Bolts, and Elementals.\n\nThe game follows the general rules of dodge ball, in that the object is to knock out the opposing members of a team within a time limit. Players with the ball can aim right, left, high, or low. Thrown balls can be caught by the opposing team, which awards them points. These points can then be used to implement special throws such as the grenade, boomerang, and the screwdriver, making the balls more difficult to avoid or catch. Options include adjustable time limits for Single Matches and three levels of difficulty.","tags":[268435470,536870990,536872078]},{"id":167115,"cover":{"id":191631,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co43v3.jpg"},"name":"Persona 5: Steelbook Edition","platforms":[{"id":48,"name":"PlayStation 4"}],"tags":[268435468]},{"id":29599,"cover":{"id":107615,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co2b1b.jpg"},"name":"Elsewhere High: Chapter 1 - A Visual Novel","platforms":[{"id":6,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"},{"id":14,"name":"Mac"}],"screenshots":[{"id":67616,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/t3dxyvdzcqtuz1vqwly2.jpg"},{"id":67617,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/tdn7fzcyo4cfsv0klnsa.jpg"},{"id":67618,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/ly4yauxplhgnvlvffgbs.jpg"},{"id":67619,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/wwikp5r6brxlr8lbxqcb.jpg"},{"id":67620,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/rybqpcbsjjzm3maaj9g9.jpg"}],"summary":"Welcome to Elsewhere High, \"a school for exceptional children.\"\n\nIn this visual novel, players are able to immerse themselves in the world of the outcast.
