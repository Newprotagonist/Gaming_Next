However, points are scored based on how many other tiles surround the selected tile: A maximum of 320 points are awarded for tiles completely surrounded on all six sides by other tiles. Any tiles that aren't \"standing\" on at least one other tile will fall off the board causing a premature game over: players need to balance earning points by removing entrenched tiles while ensuring that no tile will fall off the table as a result of the removal. \n \nBecause the game is not a true version of Shanghai it is named after another Chinese city - Hong Kong - instead.","tags":[268435465,268435482,536873513,536873787,536875051,536876709,536877023]},{"id":126970,"cover":{"id":173590,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co3pxy.jpg"},"name":"Epic World","platforms":[{"id":48,"name":"PlayStation 4"}],"screenshots":[{"id":361369,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc7qu1.jpg"},{"id":361370,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc7qu2.jpg"},{"id":361371,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc7qu3.jpg"},{"id":361372,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc7qu4.jpg"},{"id":361373,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc7qu5.jpg"},{"id":361374,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc7qu6.jpg"},{"id":361375,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc7qu7.jpg"},{"id":361376,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc7qu8.jpg"},{"id":361377,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc7qu9.jpg"},{"id":361378,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc7qua.jpg"}],"summary":"Epic World is a Platformer action game with tricky elements, hidden treasures and dangerous enemies.

Give them too much and their greed may get the upper hand.","tags":[17,268435465,268435469,268435471,268435488,536870972,536871013,536871027,536871029,536871208,536871456,536871906,536872060,536872070,536872149,536872282,536872315,536872406,536872421,536873787,536874694,536874706,536874916,536875046,536875050,536875244,536875531,536876018,536876124,536876217,536877368,536877754,536889431],"videos":[{"id":3973,"video_id":"HmKlAlV9IpE"}]},{"id":148155,"cover":{"id":140739,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co30lf.jpg"},"name":"SnowRunner: Burning Bright Vinyl Wrap Pack","platforms":[{"id":6,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}],"screenshots":[{"id":451009,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc9o01.jpg"}],"summary":"Customize your SnowRunner experience further with the Burning Bright Vinyl Wrap Pack, adding four exclusive skins for the Azov 5319, Azov 73210, YAR 87 and Voron AE-4380!","tags":[268435469,268435487],"videos":[{"id":62346,"video_id":"ldisM89LrHQ"}]},{"id":16560,"cover":{"id":127530,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co2qei.jpg"},"name":"In Verbis Virtus","platforms":[{"id":6,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}],"screenshots":[{"id":100459,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/ciqwingjuru0lvywowjf.jpg"},{"id":100460,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/dqlani1nchz231xeywd3.jpg"},{"id":100461,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/ybsxiuzey4olg8jlrgg6.jpg"},{"id":100462,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/u0qddggyzkla4g0kujkq.jpg"},{"id":100463,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/wmrihsevwrivdlluo6e0.jpg"}],"summary":"Use your real voice to cast spells in In Verbis Virtus, a fantasy adventure unlike any other.

Set in the year 2083 in Neo Hong-Kong the story follows Mei-Lin Mak, a young woman with cybernetic eyes pulled into the maelstrom of an unsolved supernatural mystery from centuries past. As she peers deeper into the mystery, her perception of reality slowly crumbles around her, leaving her to question every intricacy of her surroundings.\n\nUnder the neon lights of a cyperpunk dystopia, the ruins of the Chung Sing building hide a bloody mystery illuminated by both the traditions of Chinese folklore and the innovations of the industrial future. If there is any hope of escaping this nightmare, Mei-Lin must explore this complex, piecing together the stories of 14 lost souls, and discover the truth of her own family curse. With careful attention to pacing, atmosphere and storytelling, Sense hopes to return the horror genre to its roots; celebrating the slow, fearful creep of dread instead of turning to action and jump scares. Mei is not a trained agent; she is a programmer and not a soldier; the ghosts – the glitches of reality – are spirits and not spectral zombies; and the scares are from within, not from the horrors around.","tags":[19,21,268435468,268435487,268435488,536871015,536871874,536872609],"videos":[{"id":29376,"video_id":"9qdq2jMwjbs"}]},{"id":30317,"cover":{"id":108633,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co2btl.jpg"},"name":"KORABLIK","platforms":[{"id":6,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}],"screenshots":[{"id":71349,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/cr1ghzg9nntvxouoiwpp.jpg"},{"id":71350,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/pzug8wnlvvy8skjwxtem.jpg"},{"id":71351,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/mt5zftkkcbm9r81wdazu.jpg"},{"id":71352,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/vpejkwjd9qusmbub8ibo.jpg"},{"id":71353,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/xjl91puwvalbw2hzwaub.jpg"}],"summary":"Making the way through clouds of the hostile ships, turning aside and shooting garbage tons, you fly to the purpose!

The wars, famines and suffering of the last 20 millennia were to become a distant, fading memory, as scientific advances brought global peace and prosperity. Toward the end of the 20th century, a now forgotten US president even went so far as to officially proclaim the arrival of a New World Order, in which right, not might, would govern international relations. This bright future was not to be. First came a meltdown of the international stock and currency exchanges. Then the major international conglomerates were dissolved in a vain attempt to stop the fiscal hemorrhage. By 2012 the world economy had collapsed. Poverty and hunger caused social and political tensions to flare. As the crisis wore on, few were bold or naive enough to predict anything positive for the future. Most realized that the planet was on the verge of global conflict.\n\nIn 2048, the anticipated global conflict broke out with a violence that shook the planet to its core. All major centralized governments were destroyed in the maelstrom. Europe and Eastern Asia bore the brunt of the devastation, as entire urban centres, from Madrid to Moscow and from Seoul to Singapore were literally wiped off the map. \nThe human race has always been known for its resiliency. Within a dozen years, the Earth's inhabitants had begun to restore their old nationalities - with a few twists. Twelve states of the former United States joined together to form a new country, called the United Civilized States. The UCS citizens had essentially given up their old roles as producers and leaders. Nearly all work was being performed by robots which are controlled by expert computer systems. Not surprisingly, the human inhabitants of the UCS had become lazy and decadent.\n\nThe 20th-century dream for a better world had ended in death and destruction.EARTH 2150: THE MOON PROJECTThe year 2150 … one of the blackest chapters in the history of mankind. While the Lunar Corporation, Eurasian Dynasty and the United Civilized States are preparing themselves for the last all-encompassing battle, work is being feverishly carried out on a secret project on the Moon. Only the code name of this project is known ………… \"SUNLIGHT\"EARTH 2150: LOST SOULSIt is the 7th of December 2150 – in a few hours our beloved planet Earth will no longer exist.\nDevastating wars between the Eurasian Dynasty and the United Civilized States have wreaked havoc and caused mortal wounds to our planet, but that is not all, a series of nuclear explosions close to the Antarctic had changed the Earth’s orbit around the sun, glaciers melted, the sea rose to a threatening level, and meteorite showers buried whole parts of the world. Famous scientists from the Lunar corporation, a long forgotten colony on the moon first recognized the signs of the imminent catastrophe. According to their calculations  the distance between the sun and earth would decrease in the next few years by 17%, which would lead to terrible consequences.\n\nThe only hope left for the population was the escape to the red planet Mars.

There he received instruction from his wise teacher, Juan. At a young age he became a master of Kempo. One day, his teacher Juan was attacked and robbed of the Secret Scrolls of Hiryu-no-Ken, of which he was the author. Ryuhi possessed the 6th volume of the Secret Scrolls, the Shingan No Sho, or Book of the Mind's Eye which Juan had managed to save. Ryuhi begins his journey to Shorinji as a last request from a dying Juan. Gengai, the bishop of Shorinji welcomed the little Ryuhi, and begins to train him in Shorinji Kempo. Six years later, they received a letter of challenge from the Tusk Soldiers, a mysterious organization of enemies of the Shorinji. Ryuhi is determined to take part in the upcoming \"World Tournament of Contact Sports\" as a representative of Shorinji. His motive is to prevent the Tusk Soldiers from becoming champions of Contact Sports at the tournament. After learning from Gengai that it was the Tusk Soldiers who attacked his teacher and robbed him of the Secret Scrolls, he leaves for the World Tournament. There are two different types of gameplay. Journey levels are side-scrolling levels where Ryuhi must defeat five bosses and find certain items valuable to the mission. The tournament levels are where the player gets to fight one-on-one against enemies in the same way as the first game in the series released in 1985, Shanghai Kid. The player must go through the game twice to get the true ending. All six scrolls must be collected the first time through to get the first ending. The second time through the player needs to collect all six scrolls again, along with four crystal balls. The crystal balls can only be found in the second quest. However, players can miss one of these items and finish the game, but the true ending will not be received.","tags":[1,17,268435460,268435464,268435481,536870973,536871019,536871894,536872961,536875046,536875434,536876348,536886460]},{"id":44476,"cover":{"id":30375,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/eicr9xlhaua6nwdk8dch.jpg"},"name":"Karoshi","platforms":[{"id":38,"name":"PlayStation Portable"}],"summary":"We were taught to survive - now that's going to change completely.","tags":[17,18,22,27,268435461,268435464,268435465,268435471,536870915,536871262,536871882,536871937,536871945,536873787,536874694,536875046,536875067,536876054,536879582]},{"id":60035,"cover":{"id":114496,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co2gcg.jpg"},"name":"Hero Must Die","platforms":[{"id":46,"name":"PlayStation Vita"}],"screenshots":[{"id":399658,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc8kdm.jpg"},{"id":399659,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc8kdn.jpg"},{"id":399660,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc8kdo.jpg"},{"id":399661,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc8kdp.jpg"}],"tags":[268435468,268435487,536871208,536871938,536871939],"videos":[{"id":40534,"video_id":"xRT2f8VdW54"}]},{"id":134197,"cover":{"id":103794,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co2836.jpg"},"name":"Neko Ex Machina","platforms":[{"id":6,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}],"screenshots":[{"id":385771,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc89nv.jpg"},{"id":385772,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc89nw.jpg"},{"id":385773,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc89nx.jpg"},{"id":385774,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc89ny.jpg"},{"id":385775,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc89nz.jpg"}],"summary":"A love letter to the golden age of retro JRPGs! \n \n8 playable classes for your characters! \nYou can play as a warrior or an elementalist if you like being brutal.

Renamed Phantasy Star Complete Collection, this version includes the Phantasy Star II Text Adventures series, released exclusively to the Sega Meganet network, with the first of the eight games (the one following the adventures of Rolf) available to be played without unlocking. It also includes the two Game Gear titles of the series, Phantasy Star Gaiden and Phantasy Star Adventure. Unlike the GBA version, it includes all four titles of the original series. While, unlike the Sega Ages titles Phantasy Star Generation 1 and Phantasy Star Generation 2, the games are mainly untouched, several options that are not available in the Sega Saturn version are included. These options can drastically alter the games, both visually (with graphical options ranging from changing resolution, interlacing, smoothness and scanlines) and in gameplay. The changes in gameplay can alter the speed of the characters (much like the option available for Phantasy Star II and Phantasy Star III in the Saturn version, but available to all games) and also the difficulty, by changing how much money and experience the player gets from fights, which can drastically reduce the time necessary to complete the games. There are also options to change the type of machine and localization of the games, making it possible to play them in their Japanese version as well as their English localized counterparts. This compilation was released on PlayStation Network for the PlayStation 3 in 2012.","tags":[17,268435468,536871390,536875409,536890297,536890433,536896101,536896177,536896818,536896819],"videos":[{"id":39547,"video_id":"u_qdAiLGMxI"},{"id":39548,"video_id":"ARuAXMH1ZrU"}]},{"id":130974,"cover":{"id":172160,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co3ou8.jpg"},"name":"Dodge If you Can!","platforms":[{"id":6,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}],"screenshots":[{"id":380892,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc85wc.jpg"},{"id":380893,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc85wd.jpg"},{"id":380894,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc85we.jpg"},{"id":380895,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc85wf.jpg"},{"id":380896,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc85wg.jpg"},{"id":380897,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc85wh.jpg"}],"summary":"Dodge If you Can!

Depending whether or not the player completes the mission will determine whether the player can continue to the next stage or what the next stage will be.

It's also improved in that the game continues to play even when one player is choosing a character upon continuing.\n\nIn a 2-player game, when certain characters are near enough, a third-shot appears between them which can be purple shots that swirl all-over the screen, hearts that home in on enemies, or rockets that shoot straight ahead. This feature was first seen on Konami's arcade game Trigon.\n\nThe playable characters in this game are:\n\nVic Viper/Lord British\nMichael/Gabriel\nHikaru/Akane\nIvan/Toby\nMambo/Samba\nKoitsu/Aitsu\nOption/Multiple\nShooting Star/Black Viper","tags":[1,27,42,268435461,536870990,536871262,536871470,536871904,536871937,536872626,536874098,536874706,536875077,536875155,536875232,536875281,536875595,536876099,536876634,536876635,536877386,536877913,536878379,536879161,536879715,536879809,536880906]},{"id":95136,"name":"BadLands RoadTrip","platforms":[{"id":3,"name":"Linux"},{"id":6,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"},{"id":14,"name":"Mac"}],"screenshots":[{"id":219219,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/aybfi2ohrccoahrwdyhv.jpg"},{"id":219220,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/gckmlyf0im9iex6jl2iq.jpg"},{"id":219221,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/phhgwbuxjvnksgu28wak.jpg"},{"id":219222,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/tnroeofugaynixuojq2n.jpg"},{"id":219223,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/omhmj4zloefsawykxka7.jpg"},{"id":219224,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/vxmu6wk8rvzhvf7xgwpq.jpg"},{"id":219225,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/xluix7xtalyw0varl3bp.jpg"},{"id":219226,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/xv4uxcmtthabkqkcvp80.jpg"},{"id":219227,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/h6spsfbl3t1upkm9vl8f.jpg"},{"id":219228,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/yk7voppvr4lg4kwoezqh.jpg"}],"summary":"BadLands RoadTrip is a physics-based shooter, open world RPG where you build your own weapons to fight against the robot apocalypse!

When Kirby awoke, he found that it was still daytime. And evermore, it would be daytime, unless Kirby made the journey to find King Dedede and recover the stars to restore the night's sky. So begins the latest Kirby adventure, another action adventure with the morphing marshmallow in a starnge fantasy world. However, the one thing separating this latest adventure is the control scheme. Here, you don't control Kirby directly. Instead, you guide Kirby by tipping your system to roll the little round pink puff through a series of mazes.
