Co-designed by Winston Cup Champion Bill Elliott and Distinctive Software- developed or Test Drive and The Duel- this is a test of your mettle and milliseconds on the banked ovals of six official, perfectly scaled NASCAR tracks like Daytona, Talladega, Bristol, Darlington, Michigan and Atlanta. Or the two twisting road courses of Sears Point or Watkins Glen. All with bit map graphics plus a scaling technique, creating graphics so detailed you can actually read the car\u0027s make when you go bumper to bumper.\n\nOn-screen statistics tell you course length, maximum banking and the total number of laps in each race. With this vital data, adapt your car to each unique track by adjusting gear ratio, transmission, spoiler angle and tire stagger. Depending on whether you\u0027re racing or qualifying for pole position, you must also decide which type of engine to use. But \"dial in\" your car carefully. One miscalculation could send you reeling into the wall.\n\nWhen you think you have the right stuff, drop the hammer on NASCAR\u0027s finest field of racers- including Bill Elliott himself- in single races or compete for the Cup in the Championship Season.",

There are 3 different game modes: Attack mode, Endless mode \u0026 VS mode.\n\nWith roots in the classic Breakout game from a few decades ago, Block Kuzushi continues where Arkanoid left off and updates the theme with colorful jewels to hit in addition to the standard rows of bricks.\n\nDuring the course of play, weapon upgrades may be picked up such as multiple balls, shooting power and other brick bashing powerups. Roaming objects on-screen may deflect your ball so watch out for surprise changes in trajectory when these nuisances are afoot.\n\n60 levels of cleverly designed boards (and some not so clever ones) should hold your attention for a few hours.",

A returning element from the original Samurai Warriors is the Survival Mode. In this mode, the player chooses a character and fights through an endless castle. The game also contains a Sugoroku mini-game as an additional feature. Up to four players can participate in this mode, and each player has to choose a character.

The Empire mode allows the player to select from some of Japan\u0027s greatest battles. In the CAW Mode, the options are limited to 13 models with 10 color patterns each, as well as four different voices. Fortunately, a new feature is added to the mix: the ability to copy movesets of other characters. Unlike Samurai Warriors: Xtreme Legends, the game does not feature new characters for the series. However, Sasaki Kojiro and Shibata Katsuie, who were unplayable special bodyguards in the original Samurai Warriors 2, are now playable characters in Samurai Warriors 2 Empires.",

Taking inspiration from George Romero\u0027s \"Of the Dead\" series, the mod is set during a time in which the world is on the verge of collapsing into chaos from a disease whose origin is unknown. Many experts and organizations have their theories and ideas on how such a disease emerged and started to systematically destroy our very way of life, but one fact is clear to all. Whoever perishes from the disease gets up and kills, and the people they killed get up and kill. \n \nThe chances of you surviving this all out war of society and the undead are slim to none. Already, there are millions of the walking dead shambling about, searching for food to eat. There\u0027s no known cure. One bite can possibly end it all for you. However, you aren\u0027t alone in this nightmare. There are still a handful of uninfected survivors left in this god forsaken hellhole, and with co-operation and teamwork, you may live long enough to fight your way to salvation.Features:Teamwork: Co-operative play with up to eight players. \n \nVoice and Text Communications Limited by Distance: The further you\u0027re away the harder it is for other players to hear you. Keep those walkie talkies close. \n \nDynamic Objective Maps: The next playthrough may not be the same as the last! \nSurvival Mode: Defend and maintain your shelter against the undead in the hopes of getting extracted to a safe area. \n \nA Realistic Approach: In short, no crosshairs with limited \"only when you want it\" HUD. In addition, ammo and weapons are extremely scarce. With that in mind, aim down your sights and shoot for the head! \n \nMultitude of Different Opponents: Ranging from the iconic \"walking zombie\" to the more contemporary \"runners\", NMRiH will keep you on your toes with a mix of dangerous foes to face down. However, the most dangerous enemy may not always be the walking dead... \n \nInfection: One bite may be what it takes to bring you down. If infected, you must decide if you want to alert your team to rid you of your burden, or to keep quiet in the hopes of finding a cure...",

Tasked with tracking down the source of an inscrutable signal, she must navigate, survey and survive an eerie, ever-shifting landscape reclaimed by nature — and perhaps something stranger.\n\n\u0027My Work Is Not Yet Done\u0027 seeks to provide a unique and innovative take on the survival genre aimed at accurately reproducing the physical and psychological experience of being alone and lost in the wilderness, resituating the player’s role within nature as an interloper rather than conquistador. The game is set in an expansive open world environment that eschews the genre tropes of cold weather survival for a dense, oppressively rainy and humid forest, seamlessly blending procedural generation with a variety of handcrafted locations to ensure a sense of constant disorientation even across repeat playthroughs.",

The Mercury blob itself has now been given an overhaul and has 4 varying \u0027states\u0027 - Normal, Solid, Fast and Slow. These states allow for larger more complex levels, which in turn mean a greater challenge and more enjoyment to be had for the player. The number of levels has more than doubled - now 160+, and with the newly added feature of Downloadable Content more levels will be made available at a later date. Wireless 2 Player modes have also been an important addition, with 5 sub games each providing a challenge against the computer or a friend.",

    "summary": "Metro: Last Light (also known as Metro 2033: A Light of Hope in Russia) is a single-player post-apocalyptic-themed first-person shooter video game with stealth and survival horror elements, developed by Ukrainian studio 4A Games and published by Deep Silver for Microsoft Windows, OS X, Linux, PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 in May 2013. PlayStation 4 and Xbox One versions of the game were released August 26, 2014. \n \nThe game is set in a post-apocalyptic Moscow, part of the universe of the novel Metro 2033 and its sequels, written by Russian author Dmitry Glukhovsky, but does not follow any direct storylines from the books. Previously announced as Metro 2034, the game is a sequel to the video game Metro 2033, and although Glukhovsky did work with developer 4A Games, it bears no relation to the book Metro 2034. Rumors on his website point to the upcoming book, Metro 2035, to be a novelization of Metro: Last Light, but it will cover the plot and dialogue in much greater detail and length. \n \nInitially, the game was to be published under THQ and expected to be released in the middle of 2012; it was announced on February 2, 2012, that the game would be delayed until the first quarter of 2013, and on March 1, 2013 the game was delayed again until May. Following THQ\u0027s closure in January 2013, the intellectual property was acquired by video game publisher Deep Silver. \n \nMetro: Last Light received positive reviews from critics. Praise was directed at the game\u0027s story (including its atmosphere, presentation, and environments), graphics (especially on Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One), and the improvements made over Metro 2033 (such as the controls, gunplay, sound, and stealth mechanics). The game did, however, draw some criticism for its linear sequences, AI, and technical issues.",

Though it was developed by the Turbine team (with Microsoft\u0027s extensive assistance), it was published as a Microsoft title until 2004.\n\nThe game was set on the island continent of Dereth and several surrounding smaller islands and archipelagos on the fictional planet of Auberean. The game was played in a large, seamless 3D virtual world which could host thousands of players\u0027 characters at a time.\n\nReleased on November 2, 1999, it was the third major MMORPG to be released and was developed at the same time as Ultima Online and Everquest. After initial success, its subscription numbers dropped as newer MMORPGs moved into the market. Its host servers remained online for over 17 years after the game\u0027s original launch.",

    "summary": "Merchants of Kaidan is a challenging trading game fused with lots of RPG elements. You start very humble, one cart, a purse of gold and silver coins is all that you have. Your task is to roam the world and search of opportunities to score some profit. Buy low, sell high - a merchant\u0027s motto is easy to grasp. And yet the job is harder than it seems.\n\nA good merchant needs to know everything about the market, he is always on the lookout for a deal, always listening, always engaging and deepening his knowledge. He knows what forces influence the prices, what events affect them. A good merchant listens to rumours and gossips spread by travelers at inns and taverns; hoping for a clue, a hint where to go, where a good deal awaits. A good merchant surrounds himself with specialists smarter than him, people who help him maximize profits and minimize losses. He always expands his fleet of carts, he balances risks, calculates profitability. \n\nThe conditions are constantly changing, and supply and demand for different goods with them. Maybe you\u0027d like to pay a cheaper price for furs in the summer, and sell them for a hefty profit as the winter is coming and people need warmth.\nBut is it worth carrying them for so many days, risking robbery, moths and taking precious space that you could use to transport something now and make a profit immediately?\n\nOr is it worth to buy illegal herb in the out of reach swamps where it cost\u0027s next to nothing, and risk smuggling it into the city where you can sell it for an amazing profit? But what if the city guards want to control you? Should you pay a bribe? How big? Maybe the best course of action is to say that you have nothing and hope they don\u0027t find anything?\n\nThese are the types of questions you will have to ask yourself constantly. \n\nMerchants of Kaidan has 4 story lines each with many quests. Main quest that brings you closer to avenging your father\u0027s murder, and 3 side-quest lines. A total of over 100 quests each composed of multiple steps.",

The player is cast as Flint Lockwood, an aspiring inventor who tries to solve the hunger problem in his town by creating a machine that turns water into food. Soon, the machine is out of control, and it literally is raining food on Flint\u0027s town. It\u0027s up to him to stop the machine and get rid of the abundance of food. To make matters worse however, the machine is now protected by mutated food.\n\nThe player has to fight and puzzle their way through twenty levels, using Flint\u0027s self created gadgets such as a hair dryer converted into a heat gun, which can be used to melt obstacles composed of ice cream, or a mechanical boxing glove to punch food. Each level features thirty specific destroyable food items. Destroying all of them unlocks a piece of a blueprint for a special item.",
