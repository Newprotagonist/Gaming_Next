    "summary": "Phantom Brave is a strategy RPG which takes place in the world of Ivoire. Ivoire consists of vast seas and numerous islands; it used to be a peaceful place, but an ancient (and powerful) force is now threatening life in the various lands. The character you control in the game is Marona, a 13 year old orphaned girl. Marona has the ability to communicate with phantoms, an ability that brings a lot of resentment from other people but will help her to head out into the world and solve the problems that are occurring. A phantom known as Ash acts as Marona\u0027s guardian; as the game progresses, other phantoms will join your party, each of which have different capabilities.\n\nThe game features a turn based combat system. During battles, Marona is able to attack enemies by herself, and she can also summon phantoms in her party to help out. To summon phantoms, you will need to confine them to an object on the screen (such as a rock or tree). Once confined to an object, you will then be able to control the phantom in battle, though phantoms only remain controllable for a limited number of turns. The object you confine a phantom to will affect it\u0027s abilities; for example, a rock may make a phantom stronger but move slower. By defeating enemies in battle you earn experience points allowing to level up and become more powerful.",

    "summary": "Inspired by the naughty back room arcades of ‘90s Japan, Bishoujo Battle Cyber Panic! offers the instant gratification of a sub-genre that\u0027s both easy to learn and fun to master. Start each action-packed stage with a silhouetted girl behind the playfield and dodge enemies while drawing lines that cut away when connected, methodically uncovering the image underneath.\n\nIt\u0027s a game of risk-vs-reward as you capture as much of the playfield as possible without enemies or bullets crossing your path. Will you whittle away at smaller and safer zones along the edge, or will you go for higher scores by cutting into enemy territory? Box in power-ups to use their effects, unlock completed images in the gallery and share your victories across online leaderboards!\n\nFeatures:\n\n• Rescue anime-style mecha girls in 50 unique stages!\n• Decide your own strategy in freeform gameplay.\n• Adapt to gradually increasing difficulty.\n• Unlock special 5-star challenges with the girls in alternate outfits!\n• View your captured images in Gallery mode.\n• Enjoy a pumping soundtrack that will get you in the mood.\n• Share high scores with online leaderboards!",

    "summary": "Deer Hunter is a series of hunting simulation video games. Originally available for Windows platform published by WizardWorks Software, it was also published on Mac, and later on Game Boy Color, PlayStation 2, and mobile phones. The first game in the series was developed for only USD$125,000, yet sold over a million copies and topped the PC game charts.[1] It was an early success in the casual game market.[2] \n \nThe original game was released in November, 1997. In 2003 Southlogic Studios was commissioned by WizardWorks Software to develop Trophy Hunter 2003 and because of Trophy Hunter\u0027s success, they took over the development of the Deer Hunter franchise, with Deer Hunter 2004 and Deer Hunter 2005, distributed by Atari. Glu Mobile acquired the entire franchise in April 2012.[3] The original Deer Hunter and its sequel Deer Hunter II have also been released for Macintosh computers. \n \nGameplay usually takes place in a thick forest or meadow during different seasons of the year. Animals and objects other than deer can be seen while playing, including Bigfoot and UFOs in some incarnations, but these serve no purpose other than scenery. Some animals may be shot and killed, but the player receives no trophy and will be penalized if the animal was a protected species. In the latest versions, players can also manage a deer herd with deer growth and genetics deciding the traits of offspring",

    "summary": "Nintendogs (Japanese: ニンテンドッグス Hepburn: Nintendoggusu?) is a realtime pet simulation video game developed and published by Nintendo for the Nintendo DS handheld video game console. It was first released in Japan, and was later released in North America, Australia, Europe, and other regions. It was originally released in three different versions: Dachshund \u0026 Friends, Lab \u0026 Friends (Shiba \u0026 Friends in Japan), and Chihuahua \u0026 Friends. It has been re-released twice since then, first as a bundled release with a special edition Nintendo DS with a new version called Nintendogs: Best Friends, and then later as Nintendogs: Dalmatian \u0026 Friends.\n\nNintendogs uses the DS\u0027s touchscreen and built-in microphone. The touch screen allows the player to pet a dog, as well as to use various items that can be found or purchased. These range from balls and frisbees, to toys, to grooming supplies to keep the dogs happy. The microphone is used to call to the player\u0027s dog by speaking the name given to the dog in the beginning of the game as well as to teach the dog tricks such as \"sit\" or \"roll over\". Players can bring their dogs on walks and to the park if they so choose. They may interact with other players in multi-player by using the DS\u0027s wireless linkup. It also uses the DS\u0027s internal clock and calendar to allow the dog to grow hungrier or dirtier based on the elapsed time.\n\nNintendogs received critical acclaim. It has an aggregate score of 85% at Game Rankings, and has won many awards, including the 2006 Innovation Award from PC World and Best Handheld Game from the Associated Press. As of March 31, 2015, all versions of Nintendogs combined have sold 23.96 million copies worldwide, making it second on the Nintendo DS best-sellers list, behind only New Super Mario Bros. Because of Nintendogs\u0027 success, Nintendo has made several related products, including Nintendogs toys and a series of Nintendogs trading cards. At E3 2010, it was announced a sequel, titled Nintendogs + Cats, would be released for the Nintendo 3DS.",

    "summary": "Wizball is a scrolling shooter in similar vein to Gradius with an additional collection dynamic. It is a horizontally scrolling game taking place over eight levels, which involves navigating around a landscape and shooting at sprites. However, the aim of the game is to collect droplets of coloured paint to colour the level. Each level starts off as monochromatic, drawn in three shades of grey, and needs three colours (red, blue, and green) to be collected to complete it. The player, a wizard who has taken the form of a green ball, can navigate between the levels through portals. At first the wizard only has access to the first three levels, but completing levels gains access to further levels. Each level has bouncing spheres of a different colours, and shooting them releases droplets, which may be collected. At the same time, each level needs a different colour to be added, which can be composed by collecting sufficient quantities of the correct colours. On later levels, the spheres of paint start shooting bullets, further adding to the challenge. \n \nThe wizard himself is not capable of collecting paint droplets, and is initially capable of very limited movement, bouncing up and down at a fixed rate, with the player only controlling a speed of rotation, and thus how fast it will move horizontally after next touching the ground. Collecting green pearls (which appear when some sprites have been shot) gives the player tokens which can be used to \"buy\" enhancements, such as greater control over movement and improved firepower, and also a companion known as Catellite. Catellite (ostensibly the wizard\u0027s cat) is also spherical in form. It normally follows the wizard, but it can also be moved independently by holding down the fire button whilst moving the joystick (which also renders the wizard uncontrollable). Only Catellite is capable of collecting paint droplets; the player has to use it to do so. In the two-player mode, Catellite is controlled by the second player. As well as droplets of colours, sometimes droplets of other colours also appear, having various effects. These include: \n \nLight blue - causes a \"filth raid\", where a wave of fast-moving enemies appear, shooting bullets at the player. \nGrey - changes Catellite into an \"Indestructacat\", making it invulnerable to enemies. \nWhite - gives an extra life. \nPurple - changes Catellite into a \"mutant cat\", causing it to disobey the player\u0027s controls. \nBlack - causes \"freaky bits\", turning most of the scenery black.",

Quite a challenging one, in fact.\n- Average play time of 2 hours (or, if you like to spend more time, as long as you want)\n- Knock off enemy bullets with your sword to shoot and slash your way through stages.\n- No save points during stages. Enemies are tough, and so are the bosses. Study their moves and work around them.\n- When it’s game over, you start over from the beginning of the stage. You won’t be getting it easy!\n- Some health items, shields, bombs, etc. are just a few useful items.\n- All this for a small price.\"",

You have a strong army at your disposal, and can direct your generals as to which countries they attempt to invade.\n\nThe game is turn-based, and these turns operate in phases, beginning with the economic circumstances of population and tax income being decided - it\u0027s recommended to keep taxation taxing low unless things become desperate. The game then updates you on the statuses of your generals, and give you the chance to redistribute them to other parts of your kingdom.\n\nOfficers may rebel and cause a civil war - fortunately this can usually be pre-empted. More serious are attempts to take land from other civilizations, which take place in order and include conflicts between other groups. These, like every element of the game, are accurately historically modeled and variable in time-span as a result.",

Unlike the previous KOF tournaments depicted in the Fatal Fury series, the new King of Fighters is a team tournament, with eight teams of three, each representing a different nationality, participating this time. Most characters come from other SNK games, such as Team Italy, which is composed of three heroes from the original Fatal Fury: Terry Bogard, Andy Bogard and Joe Higashi. The two heroes from Art of Fighting (Ryo Sakazaki and Robert Garcia) are featured along with their mentor and Ryo\u0027s father (Takuma Sakazaki) make up Team Mexico. Team Korea features Kim Kaphwan from Fatal Fury 2 as the leader of two convicts he\u0027s trying to reform Chang Koehan and Choi Bounge, while Team England is a mix of female fighters from Fatal Fury 2 (Mai Shiranui) and the Art of Fighting series (Yuri Sakazaki, King). The two heroes from Psycho Soldier (Athena Asamiya and Sie Kensou) form Team China along with their mentor, Chin Gentsai. Similarly, Team Brazil features the heroes from Ikari Warriors (Ralf and Clark) along with their commanding officer Heidern. Additionally, the game features two teams composed entirely of original characters: Team Japan featuring Kyo Kusanagi, Benimaru Nikaido and Goro Daimon, and Team USA composed of Heavy D!, Lucky Glauber and Brian Battler.",

Each self-contained habitat has been separately bio-engineered by a powerful ecosystem generation network known as a Multiple Organism Unit Link. MORGUL, for short. Early colonists used MORGUL to render Alterra inhabitable. But a cataclysmic quake severed all system interface functions, and MORGUL murderously rebelled. The few colonists lucky enough to escape told a grim tale of a higher intelligence gone berserk.\n\nFor generations, mankind sought a return to Alterra. Finally, genetic science created a saviour: Turrican, a mutant warrior, bio-engineered for the task of planetary reclamation. In the meantime, MORGUL has diligently twisted Alterran life forms to his brutal, destructive purposes. Thus, Turrican\u0027s challenges consist in eliminating hostile organisms from Alterra\u0027s five multi-level worlds and, finally, destroying the three faces of MORGUL.\n\nThis previously unreleased game is available exclusively on the Analogue Super Nt consoles and in limited release prints.",

    "summary": "Medal of Honor: Frontline for PS3 is a HD remake of the classic shooter game by Dreamworks Interactive.\nThe Nazi invasion is in full swing, and you\u0027re the Lieutenant who\u0027s going to put a stop to it. Step into the shoes of Lt. Jimmy Patterson once again, sweeping across Europe to rescue the innocent and destroy the opposition. The 15 assignments range from saving captured OSS operatives from a Nazi-held Dutch manor house to dismantling a German naval base. Of course, all of the action takes place in detailed 3D; featuring some of the more amazing graphics you\u0027ll ever lay eyes on. Your job is a little too tough for any one man to pull off on his own, so you\u0027ll have a loyal group of soldiers and a slew of weaponry including the Liberator Pistol, Panzerschreck, MG42, and B.A.R. all of which will come to your aid in the heat of battle. Divided into five main missions, the gameplay is extensive and meticulously constructed, resulting in an experience that trumps earlier series installments.",

    "summary": "The lost colony of Alterra is a completely man-made lifeworld abandoned long ago in a nearby galaxy. Alterra is actually five colonies in one. Each self-contained habitat has been separately bio-engineered by a powerful ecosystem generation network known as a Multiple Organism Unit Link. MORGUL, for short. Early colonists used MORGUL to render Alterra inhabitable. But a cataclysmic quake severed all system interface functions, and MORGUL murderously rebelled. The few colonists lucky enough to escape told a grim tale of a higher intelligence gone berserk.\n\nFor generations, mankind sought a return to Alterra. Finally, genetic science created a saviour: Turrican, a mutant warrior, bio-engineered for the task of planetary reclamation. In the meantime, MORGUL has diligently twisted Alterran life forms to his brutal, destructive purposes. Thus, Turrican\u0027s challenges consist in eliminating hostile organisms from Alterra\u0027s five multi-level worlds and, finally, destroying the three faces of MORGUL.",

From majestic plains to towering mountains, the interactive environments in Dawn of Mana offer an assortment of places to visit, characters to meet, and creatures to battle.

In this setting, the players are trying to survive by constructing space ships. \n \nThe game is round-based and each round is divided up into two phases: build phase and battle phase. During the build phase, each player gets a number of components and has to assemble a spaceship from them within a certain time limit. During the battle phase, the players pilot the ships. They battle against the other or team up against the garbage drones living in the junkyard. \n \nThe randomness and unpredictable nature of the game makes every round into a new challenge, because you always have a new ship to battle with, raising the stakes and making the game quite addictive.",

A mission is completed when all enemy forces are reduced to zero. The current level is completed when you escape from the airport with the prisoners. Your injury level increases when the enemy hits you. The game automatically ends if the injury indicator on the right side of the screen becomes completely red. You can reduce your injury level by getting power drinks.",

    "summary": "Dead or Alive 3++ was released as a rebalanced version of Dead or Alive 3 for the original Xbox game system. It features various system and character balances from the previous three versions of Dead or Alive 3. Some minor tweaks have been added to the game system in the form of a four-way hold system, unrestricted 3D-axis movement, and less emphasis on the critical stun system. Some attack commands for characters are updated. The tag team system, introduced in the previous game, was also updated. Tag Battle was made available during the game\u0027s Time Attack and Survival modes. A new feature called Attack Change was added, allowing the character tagging in to attack while switching in. The Tag Throws command was made a bit easier to activate. By default, the game utilizes the Xbox controller\u0027s analog face buttons, making the controls lenient to allow players new to the series to adapt to gameplay, players have the option to turn the analog buttons on or off. As with previous entries in the series, it took advantage of the Xbox system\u0027s power to push the range of the graphics and stage sizes farther than Dead or Alive 2.",

As is the case with many titles in this sub-genre, gameplay involves careful scrutiny of each scene that players encounter, as they search for clues, information, and items that will aid them in their quest. Movement and interaction are facilitated by a context-sensitive cursor, through which players can manipulate puzzles and the environment. The puzzles themselves are a familiar blend of search quests and brain-teasers, requiring players to acquire and combine numerous items before they can be used to remove particular obstacles.",

Most of the game is viewed from a top-down view. When the player enters a building, the gameplay perspective shifts to a first-person view. The game is significant for combining two different perspectives and for being an early game mastered in surround sound (Dolby Pro Logic).",

    "summary": "Castlevania: Circle of the Moon is the first of the series to be based on the action/RPG structure of Castlevania:Symphony of the Night rather than the level-based action style of all previous Castlevania games. Dracula\u0027s castle is a single continuous building, and as Nathan discovers artifacts within it he gains new abilities that allow him to explore more of it. While Nathan can only use his Killer Whip as a weapon, he can find and equip different kinds of armor and accessories that change his stats. Unique to this entry in the series is the Dual Set-up System, where a combination of two cards will give Nathan unique magical abilities. For example, equipping a fire type card with a whip card will give the Killer Whip a fire attribute, while equipping it with a summon card will let Nathan summon a fire demon to attack onscreen enemies.",

    "summary": "Namco, the genius company behind Tekken and Ridge Racer, has also proved itself a dab-hand at the motorcycle racing game. Early 2001, the arcade giant released Moto GP for PlayStation 2, and its runaway success quickly led to the research of a sequel. After considerable development time, Namco return with the second instalment.\n\nMoto GP 2 players can expect a glut of updates. New season statistics have naturally been included, and there are now 10 circuits to race on, all of which are genuine true-to-life tracks, bustling with interactivity. The graphics are noticeably better, cleaner, with improved textures and far fewer aliasing troubles.\n\nThe gameplay is as polished as ever, with easy-to-learn controls, a steady learning curve, and AI that doesn’t make you want to tear your hair out... at least until you reach the later stages of the game. Moto GP 2 also offers the usual Championship and Time Trial mode of play. But, in typical Namco fashion, multiplayer mode is where the majority of the fun is to be had. In the entire history of video games, the ability to play the same game with one or more friends is still one of the most welcome features in a game.\n\nMoto GP 2 doesn’t disappoint in this regard. It’s frantic, it gets personal, and that’s what makes it interesting. A grand sequel, all in all. Well worth a look, even if you own the original.",

You explore your dream world. The dream world will be a huge world with everything from factories with robots to magic forests with faeries and everything in between.\n\nThe dream world will eventually tie into the real world and you can use some crops that you grow in your farm to affect the dream world (mostly the mushrooms you can grow later).

In Europe, it is known as King Kong: The Official Game of the Movie. Due to the limited technology the Game Boy Advance has, King Kong: The 8th Wonder of the World is very different from the home console versions of the game. In this game, players switch between various roles - one being the movie exhibition visiting Skull Island to do filming which comprises actress Ann Darrow, director Carl Denham and scriptwriter Jack Driscoll, and the 25 ft gorilla and king of Skull Island, King Kong. While the overhead human section focuses on puzzle-solving and adventuring elements, Kong sections are combat-oriented side-scrollers.",

As you hit the arrows, you will be informed if your step was bad timing, pretty good, or perfect. Increasing your accuracy unlocks bonus combos, and by filling the rank meter you can increase your score and change the animated visuals in the background. \n \nDance Factory includes five modes of play to entertain and exercise your body and brain. \"Normal\" mode has you dancing through one song while endurance mode challenges you to dance through an entire album. \"Fitness\" mode does not keep score, but counts calories that are lost as you boogie to the beat. \"Record\" mode allows you to save your custom dance routines for later use, and \"EyeToy Camera\" mode lets you see your movements and also adds two extra steps that you execute by using your hands. \"Creature\" mode will access bebop beasts that are hiding in music CDs everywhere. The creatures dance in the background as you cut a rug, and credits earned can be used to accessorize your new friend with sunglasses, jewelry, portable radios, and more. Challenge your friends to a den dance-off with a multiplayer option for up to 16 jivers.",

The player is armed with an arsenal consisting of the scepter of Ra and the Kanopic bombs of fury, with this, Anubis sets off to save Egypt once and for all! In this game, the player will have to face off with legions of evil enemies across nine playable levels of gameplay.\n\nThe player controls Anubis from a third-person perspective through levels with platform puzzles and enemies that are taken out by swinging his staff or locking on to them and shooting energy balls. In each level Anubis needs to find eight pyramids that open up the portal to end the stage. Contrary to the title, this is not the sequel to an earlier game.",

It is the first entry in the series for the Nintendo DS, and the fifth to appear on Game Boy Advance. \n \nAmerican Sk8land uses cel shaded visuals and it was developed by Vicarious Visions, the developer of the Game Boy Advance Tony Hawk games. The game is based on its console counterpart, American Wasteland, featuring the same soundtrack, many of the same environments, characters. \n \nThe top screen is used to display the main gameplay, while the touch screen displays an overhead map of the area the player is currently skating, as well as icons for easily performing tricks. The touch screen is also used to create Skateboard art. Furthering the use of the DS\u0027s functions is the ability to record, with the DS microphone, your own sound clips for use in the game. \n \nAmerican Sk8land was the first Nintendo DS game released by a third party to support the Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection, the online service for the Nintendo DS. Players are able to play Trick Attack, Score Challenge, Combo Mambo and The Price is Wrong. Players are also able to upload or download graffiti, board art, highscores, and replays to one of the servers, and can periodically download new goals to complete. \n \nIn the DS version, the ability to get off the skateboard and walk around was removed; however, this was somewhat balanced by the ability to come to a complete stop and rotate the camera. \n \nThe name is shared by the Game Boy Advance version, also created by Vicarious Visions. The GBA version does not share the same graphics, however, having an isometric point of view, polygonal skaters and pre-rendered levels creating a 3D sensation.",
