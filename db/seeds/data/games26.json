In order to ensure their party will be, Pooh and Tigger are going to need some honey (known in Milne\u0027s world as \"hunny\"). In fact, the duo will need to find dozens of pots full of the stuff, and that will mean searching the entire forest. Much to Pooh and Tigger\u0027s collective dismay, the area is populated by dozens of insects, angry animals, and environmental dangers. In addition to searching for the hunny, you\u0027ll have to help your pals find such popular characters as Rabbit, Piglet, and Owl, as well as unlocking dozens of hidden areas and special power-ups. Three mini-games Veggy Match, River Run, and Fence Off can also be uncovered, and you can save all of your progress and resume play with a password. The game spans 18 levels and five diverse environments including The Spring Glade, The Nighttime Forest, Autumn Heights, Creepy Caves, and Winter Wood.",

    "summary": "In the future, cyberspace has become exceedingly dominant. Armed conflicts and cyber-terrorism flourished. Giant mechas known as Simulacrums are utilized for battles within the cyberspace. Toru Souma is an expert hacker of the Steppenwolf group, which specializes in stealing and selling valuables from servers. One day, Toru was caught in a battle between the military organization FLAK and a terrorist group. In a series of events, his friend was killed. Stricken by grief, Toru decides to avenge his death and joins FLAK, only to unravel a much larger conspiracy.\n\nBaldr Force is a follow-up to Baldr Bullet. It uses a different scenario and character cast, but is very close to its predecessor gameplay-wise. Like in Baldr Bullet (and unlike Baldrhead), there is no exploration of any kind in the game, and all battles take place within confined areas as dictated by the plot. Combat system is nearly identical to that of the previous game, with the exception of \"force crashes\", powerful attacks that can be equipped on the protagonist\u0027s mech. The game\u0027s plot may branch depending on the decisions taken by the player during the visual novel-like portions.",

It doesn\u0027t matter if you change octaves in the middle of the song or what words are you singing in (it doesn\u0027t have a word recognition), so your singing is rated by how well you manage to hit the correct note at the correct time. There\u0027s a new mode called Harmony Duet, in which two players sing different lines of the same song, at the same time.",

Raven Shield moved toward mainstream first-person shooters like Counter-Strike, adapting various features absent in previous versions. These included the ability to see one\u0027s weapon while in first-person view, many new weapons and upgrades (including larger magazines and sights), and a redesigned multiplayer. \n \nA console version, entitled Rainbow Six 3, was developed for the Xbox, PlayStation 2, and Nintendo GameCube. This iteration of the game features the same basic engine, models, textures, and artwork, but with significantly different game mechanics, gameplay, and storyline. A port was also released on Mac OS X on December 19, 2003. Due to the console version\u0027s success on the Xbox and the popularity of its subscription-based online multiplayer service, Xbox Live, an Xbox-exclusive semi-sequel was released in 2004 titled Rainbow Six 3: Black Arrow. The next full game in the Rainbow Six series, Rainbow Six: Lockdown, was released in 2005.",

Spoken dialogue is in English, with Japanese subtitles. New scenes, clarifying certain plot points, such as Riku\u0027s journey and foreshadowing of Kingdom Hearts II, were included, but no new dialogue was recorded. A gameplay option allows the player to skip cutscenes after seeing them once. The optional bosses first included in the English version were introduced to Japanese players for the first time, along with a new fight against \"Unknown Man,\" in an attempt to raise interest for the sequel.",

Three levels of realism are available to let the player customize their riding experience, building at the same time a smooth learning curve.\n\nPlaying with the Low Sim is perfect to learn the tracks and the bike behavior, Medium Sim model eases the reactions of the powerful SBK bikes, but leaves to the player the possibility of doing incredible late braking maneuvers, Full Sim gives the player the full control of the monster machines of the game. Before getting to the track, the player can set up his bike in the pits using all the options that a real race rider can use. If he doesn’t know how to improve his bike, an engineer is available to do the right fixes based on the player feedback about bike handling. All the player has to do is to tell how handling his bike felt and the engineer will do the setting changes he needs.",

You are Captain Buck Mann, a Space Runner whose job is to transport valuable cargo from one end of the galaxy to the other... and one thing’s for sure: it’s going to be a bumpy ride! Not only do the cosmic highways regularly pass through asteroid belts of all sizes, but they are also used by dangerous and unscrupulous pirates armed to the teeth, whose fighters and battle cruisers will make short work of your transport vessel if you’re totally unprepared.\nFulfil your contracts with gusto and your reputation will soar, opening the doors to new clients and more demanding and hazardous assignments... but which will also be more lucrative! Unlock new modules for your ship or upgrade those you already own: laser turrets, missile launchers, shield generators, thrusters, power plants and other modules will allow you to adapt to new combat situations in mid-flight that arise on your travels. Build, recycle, repair and reposition the modules and improvise as best you can to deal with the multiple threats you will face.\n\nRetry the first missions with the advanced modules you’ve just unlocked to improve your score, and challenge your friends to do better!",

Just like its predecessors, Downpour combines exploring abandoned surroundings, talking to characters, and solving puzzles, set against a slow, psychological horror theme. Different from the previous game Silent Hill: Shattered Memories is the return of combat. The player often has to fight off monsters using a variety of weapons, but he can carry only one melee and one ranged weapon who can deteriorate over time. Entirely new to the series is the introduction of a weather system: there is a full day and night cycle and rain often warns the player of danger that is approaching. It is possible to hide until the weather becomes better again.",

    "summary": "Minecraft focuses on allowing the player to explore, interact with, and modify a dynamically-generated map made of one-cubic-meter-sized blocks. In addition to blocks, the environment features plants, mobs, and items. Some activities in the game include mining for ore, fighting hostile mobs, and crafting new blocks and tools by gathering various resources found in the game. The game\u0027s open-ended model allows players to create structures, creations, and artwork on various multiplayer servers or their single-player maps. Other features include redstone circuits for logic computations and remote actions, minecarts and tracks, and a mysterious underworld called the Nether. A designated but completely optional goal of the game is to travel to a dimension called the End, and defeat the ender dragon.",

There can be up to three players on-screen at the same time. Using two buttons, Attack and Jump, the characters all have standard moves typical of Capcom side-scrollers of the day. Common enemies including Wei soldiers such as bandits, privatees, wrestlers, fatties and thieves will keep poping up from everywhere. In the end of each stage there is a Wei general as stage boss. Li Dian, Xiahou Dun, Xu Chu, Zhang Liao, Cao Ren, Xu Huang, the infamous Lu Bu as final boss. After defeating them all, there is also Cao Cao himself who would try to escape. \n \nThere is also a variety of weapons in the game which can be picked up. As with most side-scrollers, food is used to replenish health and can be found in various breakable containers in the game level. One notable feature of the game is the ability to summon a warhorse which adds more attacks to the characters, generally involving pole-arms (except long bow for Huang Zhong)",

    "summary": "Darkfall Online is an MMORPG released in 2009 and got shut down in 2012. Darkfall: New Dawn is a licensing project rebooting the original game and then will continue to improve its functionalities until it reaches its full potential. \n \nDesign wise, New Dawn will stay true to the dream that was sold before the original launch, while picking up the good aspects of what the game ended up being years later. Our focus being to create a meaningful empire building game where sandbox features and PvP are just tools to an end. \n \nDarkfall Online boasts impressive technology that has yet to be equaled in the industry, providing large scale battles with projectile calculation and player collisions in a seamless open world. \n \nTrue Action Combat \n \nMost of the game is played in first person view, for archery and magic, and a close third person view for melee combat. It has naval combat, mounted combat and an heroic fantasy version of tanks. \nYou could compare Darkfall to an MMOFPS, but with a living, breathing, virtual world. \n \nCharacters in Darkfall are completely free of restrictions. This is a game without classes that offered a multitude of skills and spells that increased with use and let players feel the limit of their own abilities. There are no mages, warriors or rangers, only combatants that use whatever tools they can to reach victory. \n \nLarge Scale Warfare \n \nAnd victory is of the utmost importance, as Darkfall is an open PvP full loot game, where equipment pieces are consumable commodities rather than a traditional “best in slot”. War in Agon is just as much about economy than it is about fame and glory. \n \nDarkfall pits three asymmetric racial alliances over the control of Agon. In traditional heroic fantasy fashion, the Humans, Elves and Dwarves are allies. Against them are the Orks and Mahirims, a race of wolfmen. And finally, standing alone, are the cave dwelling creations of a living god: the Alfars. \nThis racial war aspect, and the alignment system, balances the harshness of the world, as you almost always find shelter amongst your kin. \n \nHowever, where Darkfall shines the most is in its conquest and clan driven political system. The game is comprised of capturable holdings and villages where players can create a home and influence the day to day lives of each other through war, alliances, sieges and trade. \nA lot of these features were at the first step of implementation and aside from the combat aspect, Darkfall was rather incomplete. New Dawn will finish and expand Darkfall to make it the ultimate empire building game, but also a game where players can act as their own agent and have meaningful daily activities.",

    "summary": "The masterful author who brought you the Hellraiser films and countless successful horror novels tries his hand at video games with this creepy, haunting saga. Set in the early 1920s, the action takes place in the Irish countryside and revolves around a plagued fellow by the name of Patrick Galloway. Full of terrifying twists and turns, the game follows Galloway as he\u0027s haunted by specters--an ailment that will slowly drive him to the brink of insanity over the course of the game\u0027s many chapters. He\u0027ll have both magic and some powerful weaponry to help him through his journey, but as the plot thickens, so does the level of difficulty. Blending fever-pitch action with a deep, thorough story, Clive Barker\u0027s Undying is chilly enough to keep you up at night and addicting enough to occupy you for weeks.",

The player must move the cursor to as many notes as possible, and press the button on the controller in time with the music to dance along. Play well, and Riho will stay with the rhythm and earn points, but play poorly and she will start to get out of breath. If too many wrong notes are played, the song will be failed and end early. \n \nExtra songs and costumes can be unlocked by beating preset scores in the Lesson mode. There are a total of 12 songs and 14 costumes to unlock. It is also possible to save replays of performances to watch later without the note bar obscuring the view of Riho.",

Kirby\u0027s Dream Land plays like other platformers of the 8-bit and 16-bit era of video games: Kirby must use various natural abilities and occasionally external abilities or items while heading toward the goal at the end of each level. Like many 1980s-era platformers, the player can accumulate points, with an extra life granted when the player has enough points. However, because Kirby lacks a save function, scores are not recorded. Also, there are no save files, so the player has to start over again when the Game Boy is turned off, if the player chooses to return to the title screen after a Game Over, or if the player resets the game. All levels are played on a two-dimensional plane, letting Kirby move only left, right, up, and down. Kirby can walk, jump, and fly. Kirby can also inhale objects and enemies, swallowing them or spitting them out as projectiles.",

It\u0027s unknown whether or not the game takes place in the same continuity as the rest of the series as its story seems self-contained. The game has a high level of difficulty, comparable to that of games such as Ninja Gaiden and some of the achievements require hours of work to achieve.",

You can perfect your chess playing skills using various teaching options; you can even view the computer\u0027s thought process as it \"thinks\" through each move. \n \nWhile this is obviously a 3D title, you can switch the camera angle for a more traditional two-dimensional perspective. The camera is adjustable in that you\u0027re able to zoom it in and out until you find a view that is to your liking. You can even switch playing sides (from black to white pieces or vise versa) or simply have a quick look at the other side of the board.",

    "summary": "America\u0027s Army is the name given to a game technology platform used to develop first person shooter (FPS) games published in 2002 by the U.S. Army. The game is branded as a strategic communication device, designed to allow young Americans to virtually explore the Army at their own pace and according to their interests to determine if soldiering matches their needs, interests and abilities. America\u0027s Army represents the first large-scale use of game technology by the U.S. government as a platform for strategic communication and the first use of game technology in support of U.S. Army recruiting. \n \nThe America\u0027s Army concept was conceived in 1999 by Colonel Casey Wardynski; the Army\u0027s Chief Economist and Professor at the United States Military Academy.[2] Wardynski envisioned \"using computer game technology to provide the public a virtual Soldier experience that was engaging, informative and entertaining.\"[3] America\u0027s Army was managed by two other U.S. Army officers serving with Wardynski at the Office of Economic and Manpower Analysis (OEMA): Major Chris Chambers and Major Bret Wilson. \n \nThe Windows version 1.0, subtitled Recon, was first released on July 4, 2002. As of January 2014, there have been over 41 versions and updates released, including updates to America\u0027s Army: Proving Grounds which was released in August 2013. All versions have been developed on the Unreal Engine. The game is financed by the U.S. government and distributed by free download. \n \nAccording to game historian Carrie McLeroy America\u0027s Army has \"grown in ways its originators couldn\u0027t have imagined\".[3] Dozens of government training and simulation applications using the America\u0027s Army platform have been developed to train and educate U.S. Army soldiers.[4] America\u0027s Army has also been used to deliver virtual soldiering experiences to participants at events, such as air shows, amusement parks, and sporting events around the country. The America\u0027s Army series has also been expanded to include versions for Xbox and Xbox 360, arcade, and mobile applications published through licensing arrangements.[5][6]",

Life is quiet so Tomoki gets his kicks by being a peeping tom who has a number of prime viewing areas that he has mapped around town.

While watching the sky and waiting for two friends, from above an object falls from the heavens which turns out to be a female being known as an Angeloid. Her name is Ikaros and she sports a shock of pink hair, angel wings, and a large bosom. Ikaros bonds with Tomoki and takes him on a radical change of life experiences. The PSP game plies the interactive adventure trade which features a new story based on the animated source material. The dialogue is accompanied by speech for added ambiance. At the outset of the adventure, the somewhat mechanical song of the cicada signals the approach of summer. Once the warm weather arrives, the citizenry of Sorami visit hot springs, the beach, parks, and other locations that are amenable to lazy day lounging and sloth. It is within this backdrop that the cast of the PSP game interact, utilize card magic, and effect changes in the Angeloids that populate the adventure.",

    "summary": "Policenauts is an interactive movie/graphic novel/adventure game with a hard science fiction storyline, written and directed by Hideo Kojima, and published by Konami. It was initially released for the PC-9821 computer platform in 1994, followed by remade versions for the 3DO in 1995, and the PlayStation and Sega Saturn in 1996. The game has never been officially released outside Japan, despite plans for an English localization of the Saturn version. On August 24, 2009 (in honor of the 46th birthday of the game designer, Hideo Kojima), an unofficial English translation patch was released onto the internet.\n\nThe game is set in a primarily first person perspective and uses a point-and-click interface: the player can move the cursor and have the protagonist (Jonathan Ingram) analyze objects around his environment or talk to other characters in the game. Like in Snatcher, the game features shooting segments where the player must defend their character from incoming enemies. The player can use the shooting trainer at the police department to test their reflex and accuracy. There are numerous puzzles in the game, including an event where the player must dismantle a bomb by following their partner\u0027s instructions.\n\nThe console versions of the game all include support for their respective mouse peripherals. The Saturn version features light gun support for the shooting segments.\n\nThe game was notable for being an early example of extensive voice recording in video games. It also featured a theme revolving around space exploration and occasional full-motion video cut scenes. The gameplay was largely similar to Snatcher, but with the addition of a point-and-click interface and some first-person shooter segments. Policenauts also introduced summary screens, which act to refresh the player\u0027s memory of the plot upon reloading a save, an element Kojima would later use in Metal Gear Solid. The PlayStation version of Policenauts could also read the memory card and give some easter egg dialogues if a save file of Konami\u0027s dating sim Tokimeki Memorial is present, a technique Kojima would also later use in Metal Gear Solid.",

As the first racing game to incorporate this feature, Sega Rally is considered to be one of the milestones in the evolution of the racing game genre.\n\nThe music for the arcade game was composed by Takenobu Mitsuyoshi, while the Sega Saturn port\u0027s soundtrack was done by Naofumi Hataya and the Guitar were played by Joe Satriani.",

The game exposes and ridicules Trump\u0027s manipulative use of misogyny, racial hate and xenophobic fear to win the White House to the detriment of humanity as a whole. You will follow Trump and his allies as they cheat and lie their ways to win seven key battleground states. \r\n\r\nAlthough this is a work of fiction, approximately 70% of the game content is based on actual events and quotes during and following Trump\u0027s campaign, including sound clips of Trump\u0027s most controversial speeches\r\n\r\nUsing humor, Trump: Agent of Hate explores serious issues in an increasingly divided American society, including wealth inequality, racism, fear of terrorism, fake news, conflict of interest in government, LGBT rights, abortion, sexism, climate change denial and police brutality. It pokes fun at politicians who, instead of standing up against hate, are often far too willing to zig zag their ways to personal gains.\r\nOn a lighter note, Trump: Agent of Hate also includes some mindless humor with references to pop culture phenomena over the past two years.\r\n\r\nUnderlying the satire and dark humor, the game delivers an overarching positive message towards solidarity against the rise of hate. It portrays Trump supporters as victims of Trump\u0027s con man scheme as much as the rest of us.",

The arcade version of Fusion was the first arcade machine in Europe since Dancing Stage EuroMix 2 and set a milestone as the first Dance Dance Revolution arcade machine produced by Konami since Dance Dance Revolution Extreme in 2002. The arcade release marked a total game engine upgrade from the old PlayStation-based boards to a new system built on top of an off-the-shelf PlayStation 2. This hardware upgrade would be later featured in the global release of Dance Dance Revolution SuperNova in 2006.",

Sports Interactive has been working on the 3D match engine with the support of SEGA Japan-s football development team who provided the motion capture data and some of the animations. You can now watch your matches in 3D from multiple camera angles and re-watch any part of the match by fast forwarding and rewinding the action using a new match time bar that flags the key moments in the game. The old 2d view of the match engine is still there, especially for those people whose computers aren-t powerful enough to take advantage of the 3d views. TV View: Watch your matches in new full screen TV view and customise your match day screen with widgets to view the information you need as a football manager, be it player performance, match action zones, pitch radar, latest scores and many more. Assistant Manager Feedback: Pre-match and in-match feedback from your Assistant Manager on how the team is performing and your player-s motivation levels, as well as hints on how your tactics are working and how you could outwit the opposition\u0027s tactics.",
