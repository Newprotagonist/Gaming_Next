It is the successor to NCAA Football 06 in the NCAA Football series. The product features former USC player Reggie Bush on the cover. While there weren't any stunning new features added to the PS2 and Xbox games, tweaks were added to improve the existing features.\n\nThe theme for 07 is \"Turn the Tide.\" Like the 2005 version said for home-field advantage, this year's version emphasizes that momentum is more important in college football than any other sport. This is illustrated by a momentum meter on the score graphic at the top (or bottom, in the case of the Xbox 360 version) of the screen. The more the meter is shifted towards a team, the better its players will perform (ex. If momentum bar is all the way full with a +5 number below it (or above it), all players on the team will have their attributes boosted 5 points).\n\nNCAA Football 07 also includes spring drills, an update to Race for the Heisman mode called Campus Legend (which plays more like NFL Superstar mode in Madden), ESPN integration, and a spring game in Dynasty and Campus Legend modes. ESPN integration is expected to increase with the next NCAA Football releases.","tags":[268435469,268435470,536870938,536870939,536870944,536871049,536871592,536871722,536872060,536872078,536872205,536872245,536875138,536875186,536875562,536875659,536875749,536875802,536876435,536877432,536877686,536878090,536878091,536878092,536878093,536878094,536878095,536878111,536878125,536880839,536882121,536883024,536883028,536884018]},{"id":32109,"cover":{"id":99190,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co24ja.jpg"},"name":"Glider Island","platforms":[{"id":6,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}],"screenshots":[{"id":52006,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/ttukpnsrq8jltapblupr.jpg"},{"id":52007,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/loibo9yienbolevn7dne.jpg"},{"id":52008,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/torjeseui7qprdzzjyf1.jpg"},{"id":52009,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/ieezuoucfch69sdimnlq.jpg"},{"id":52010,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/xniux4wp5vei4z5cwbgn.jpg"}],"summary":"Put your gliding skills to the test in 3 vibrant landscapes each with their own magical looks and feel.

While CoE3 appears to be a simple game with limited options at first glance, delving further into the game reveals a game of complex decision making and risky endeavors.\n\nThe main focus in CoE3 is that each race plays differently. We're not talking about a unique building and unique unit, we're talking about completely differently, with different mechanics and different goals. Perhaps you're playing a druid, focused on amassing a vast forest and jungle empire from which to harvest ingredients to summon creatures of the woods with no practical need to conquer mines. Perhaps you're a dwarf, who's only concern are mines and produce units at a set rate every turn, focused almost entirely on upgrading those units to survive as long as possible since they are so difficult to replace. With 18 different factions that alone is enough to keep your play dynamic as you vie for control of the map to conquer Elysium. That isn't where it ends, however, there are 6 scenarios in which your game takes place that will help randomize the map. These scenarios range from a the early days of an agrarian world to a giant gleaming capital, which you can conquer, that spawns patrols of human guards, to a fallen empire filled with the living dead and scarred by battlefields and tombs. There's also random events to contend with, from merchants to pillage to the very gates of the underworld opening portals to your realm, your hands will be full before you even make contact with the enemy.\n\nIn each game the objective is to defeat your enemies by relying on the strengths of your chosen race. Combat in CoE3 is automatic to keep things streamlined, but that doesn't make it non-strategic. Each unit has a desired \"location\" it wants to be in the battlefield. Archers want to be in the rear, heavy infantry want to be in front. As you can imagine, putting together an army that has enough strength to protect the powerful archers and spell casters in the rear is vital. It goes beyond that though, as you must determine your enemy's strengths and hopefully be able to counter their strategy. An army of a mere 10 trolls is extremely dangerous, perhaps able to bring down a dragon, but they can only kill 10 creatures at once. An army of 50 small units will make short work of your trolls. However, an army with a wizard able to cast high level spell may completely destroy all 50 small units in one shot but would be unable to harm 10 trolls. Determining the strength and composition of an enemy army is a vital skill, and since hitting in combat, damage, and even the very spells that will be cast are randomized based on the abilities of each unit, every battle invites potential disaster and a change of plans.Key Features:\n\n18 different classes that are unique, both in resources they need and the rituals or special abilities they have\nCopious amounts of monsters and random events, good and bad\nRandom maps.\nSpell system with 42 magic paths\nNetwork or hotseat multiplayer\nTeam play, you can be 2 players against the AI for example.\nStealth and invisibility. Scouts needed to detect stealthy troops, something better (a star spawn or a beast bat will work) needed to detect the invisible ones.\nAssassins that make an assassination attack before combat starts.\nCatapults, Hill Giants and Rocs that can throw or drop boulders during sieges.\nImmortal Liches and Vampires.\nRegenerating trolls rise from the dead if they haven't been killed too badly or their side lost.\nLarge worms that can swallow smaller enemies whole. Swallowed units take a few points of damage from digestion each round until they are freed.\nShape changers that looks like something else when seen by the enemies.\nAnd many many more monsters and abilites....","tags":[17,41,268435471,268435488,536871139,536871208,536871327,536871409,536871496,536872092,536872229,536872440,536872817,536872978,536874694,536875331,536875400,536875452,536875774,536876036,536876848,536877616,536879585,536880446]},{"id":65816,"cover":{"id":30380,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/x6xxbu1oulmahvrkirt6.jpg"},"name":"The Man in the Cape: Special Edition","platforms":[{"id":6,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}],"screenshots":[{"id":126712,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/ucj5rpakmfmrujtwq1ao.jpg"},{"id":126713,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/vtoshxsmhanoyjmzpw8t.jpg"},{"id":126714,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/fzbcput7hxl9pbwrwfwj.jpg"},{"id":126715,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/cc02zkefkusugf01k5fv.jpg"},{"id":126716,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/lupmv6yhhtb7ioojjegb.jpg"}],"summary":"In retaliation for using his roof as a city lookout point, The Man in the Cape is captured and left for dead in Mr. Granderson's superhero elimination dungeon.

Becoming Master Bonk dresses Bonk in a cape and provides him with Vulcan-esque ears, and gives him the ability to move faster and jump higher. Becoming Hungry Bonk gives Bonk an animalistic appearance with evil eyes and a mouth full of razor-sharp teeth, and gives bonk the ability to chew enemies to death, as well as providing him with a much stronger head-butt that can kill nearby foes. Becoming Stealth Bonk dresses Bonk in a striped jail outfit, and gives him the ability to enter special locked doors that lead to areas such as the bank, where Bonk can collect Smileys, the butcher's, where Bonk can eat more slabs of meat in hope for a different power-up, and jail, where Bonk loses a portion of his Smileys.\n\nGrabbing one of many tulips scattered throughout the game carries Bonk to a special bonus stage where he can face off against Mechabonk -- a RoboCop-esque version of Bonk—in a best-of-three battle to \"bonk\" one another off the edge of a small stage. Winning two rounds provides Bonk with an extra life, while a loss transforms Bonk into Wounded Bonk, where Bonk resembles a mummy and takes twice as much damage as usual.\n\nThe game overall is very similar to games in the Mario series, providing linear, side-scrolling action, multiple power-ups, and several small boss confrontations leading up to a final boss. Its treatment of power-ups is similar as well: taking a hit while powered-up causes Bonk to take no damage but instead lose his power. For those who struggle with the game, the game offers passwords after game-overs so the player does not need to start over from the beginning.","tags":[1,268435464,536871075,536871971]},{"id":119326,"cover":{"id":88391,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co1w7b.jpg"},"name":"The Elder Scrolls Online: Scalebreaker","platforms":[{"id":6,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"},{"id":14,"name":"Mac"},{"id":48,"name":"PlayStation 4"},{"id":49,"name":"Xbox One"}],"summary":"The Halls of Colossus is not the only place that held Dragons.
