Strap yourself in for hardcore gameplay uniquely designed for VR headsets.\n\nTrapped in an abandoned space station, you must race against borrowed time to find your crew before your oxygen supply runs out. As you solve puzzles to open airlocks, locate power cores and disable transmitters, something tells you that you won’t be alone when you finally escape into the universe’s deep infinity.\n\n---\n\nThese are the tenets of deep space society. Detached drops you at the edge of a universe destroyed by human misrule and extortion. Thanks to years of warfare and greed, the human colonies in deep space are no more. The great factions have crumbled; the corrupt corporations have dissolved.\nMost people adhere to the last remaining code of humanity: no killing. But in the lonely expanse of space where resources are low, many are willing to bend the rules to survive.\n\n“Detached will give you tons of freedom in how you play, and the gaming sensation is intense,” says Łukasz Hacura, Creative Director of Anshar Studios, “players of our Early Access release told us exactly what we needed to know to make the game absolutely electrifying for virtual reality headset users.”\n\nDetached isn't just a game; it’s an experience. Unlike many games where VR is a mere expansion, VR is the primary asset of Detached. To complete the game, you must master the controls of your EVA spacesuit and develop your ability to move in a realistic zero-G environment.\n\nPut your skills to the test in both single-player and multiplayer modes. Multiplayer pits you against your friends in an entirely new take on capture the flag. Race against each other to gather the necessary skills and complete your mission. Every second is precious, and every choice you make can mark the difference between life and death.\n\nSingle-player mode makes full use of the VR headset, giving you the chance to interact with the tranquil expanse of space.

Interplay Entertainment, having recently purchased the Earthworm Jim rights, handed the franchise off to VIS Interactive. The game suffered a difficult, prolonged development cycle and was repeatedly delayed until it was released in 1999 for the Nintendo 64 and Microsoft Windows. The game was not received well, with critics claiming that the charm of the originals was lost, and that despite the long development period, the game still felt sloppy and lacked previously promoted features.","tags":[1,18,27,268435464,268435487,536871049,536871208,536871262,536871682,536871882,536872070,536872666,536872961,536872983,536873552,536875074,536875088,536875095,536875209,536875271,536875531,536875819,536875848,536875870,536876105,536876196,536876803,536876855,536877042,536878061,536878505,536880000,536880072,536881063,536882085,536885026],"videos":[{"id":41911,"video_id":"zjf_YLaIx6I"}]},{"id":24594,"aggregated_rating":10.0,"cover":{"id":172540,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co3p4s.jpg"},"name":"Moonbase 332","platforms":[{"id":6,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}],"screenshots":[{"id":80199,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/xvn59ychncj67ne6mmyk.jpg"},{"id":80200,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/v6jngbtyvx7tihzeqpnb.jpg"},{"id":80201,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/qiujlilzj046cayi7bpk.jpg"},{"id":80202,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/tyibtymiyq0z2dakww3v.jpg"}],"summary":"Fun meets Frustration.

The player directly controls the character Hara who wakes up on a small island floating in the clouds. This happens every day. Every level is a puzzle where a yellow key needs to be located. To reveal the key one or more red jewels need to be picked up and taken to a white square. Gradually different types of puzzle mechanics are introduced, often by a character called Hatter in the environment.\n\nEach level consists of a single, fixed screen. There are enemies such as ghosts present that need to be avoided. The main puzzle mechanic is the ability to stop time, record movement and then play back that movement at a different location. For instance Hara can stop time, move three steps down, three step left and three steps up. By recording and then launching this movement pattern at a different location, it becomes possible to move past a wall by walking on the air. This mechanic can be used as often as possible, but only one pattern can be stored and the amount of moves per pattern is limited.","tags":[17,268435465,536872529,536900556],"videos":[{"id":43006,"video_id":"K7S0E4WviIw"},{"id":53117,"video_id":"0L9k6trS9k4"}]},{"id":4719,"cover":{"id":86029,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co1udp.jpg"},"name":"Bit.Trip Complete","platforms":[{"id":5,"name":"Wii"}],"screenshots":[{"id":103868,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/exxbopy1sunklg6vapnd.jpg"},{"id":103869,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/jbcwe3naroykobioexky.jpg"},{"id":153146,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/kaiizwfe4pmsd3dq9e0l.jpg"},{"id":153147,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/la7gifogvdshqq5ibhrr.jpg"},{"id":153148,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/efxyjs7uaikcpzfzuoig.jpg"},{"id":153149,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/ypv383f0krsgzd7u2czo.jpg"},{"id":153150,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/oowiyxykyjgtrj3ko9ch.jpg"},{"id":153151,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/ocaguwchiutipntoszuf.jpg"},{"id":153152,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/zhdktgdtvdncddvtvpby.jpg"},{"id":153153,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/oiuipn37xodvgrxktnrt.jpg"}],"summary":"BIT.TRIP COMPLETE is a compilation of all 6 award-winning BIT.TRIPgames: BEAT, CORE, VOID, RUNNER, FATE, and FLUX!

The opening-day crowd includes Pauline and Donkey Kong, who immediately falls head over heels for the lovely lass. The proud ape tries to show off his Mini DK toy to Pauline, but she picks the Mini Mario toy over his and the jealous Donkey Kong becomes enraged. He smashes the displays, destroys the toys and takes Pauline to the top floor of the amusement park. Players must find Pauline and save the day.

Most of these items are hidden in passages that have locked doors at either entrance, and in order to unlock the doors, Pac needs to eat the key that is closest to the passage that he wishes to unlock. As usual, ghosts will keep chasing Pac around the maze until he has lost all his lives. However, Pac can enter the warp tunnels at either side of the maze to lose the ghosts quickly.\n\nThere are two types of power pellets in the maze: green and yellow. Yellow power pellets cause ghosts to turn blue, allowing Pac to eat them for points, whereas green ones cause Pac to enlarge and will also cause the ghosts to become much thinner and wider, allowing him to fly over them. He can also break open the doors without the need of keys. The effects of the pellets, unfortunately, only last for a number of seconds. During the time that he is enlarged, a flashing star will appear besides two boxes that are located in the middle of the maze. The first box will display the current fruit or prize, and the other will display a rotating selection of them. If Pac manages to eat the star when they match there will be a large bonus score.\n\nOccasionally, after three or more stages, there will be a bonus stage where Pac automatically gets enlarged.

It is part of the TOCA Touring Car series. \n \nIt features various Touring Car championships from around the world, but despite carrying the TOCA name, a fully licensed British Touring Car Championship (ToCa) series was not included. This upset a lot of fans of the series, but success continued. The gameplay overall became more \"Arcade\" and the replacement of qualifying laps with random grid positions together with the omission of penalties for bad driving made the game much more playable for the casual gamer. Curiously, unlike the first two titles in the TOCA series, World Touring Cars was not released in a Microsoft Windows version.","tags":[32,268435466,268435470,536872078,536875069]},{"id":107122,"cover":{"id":70510,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co1iem.jpg"},"name":"Glozzle","platforms":[{"id":6,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"},{"id":34,"name":"Android"}],"screenshots":[{"id":269780,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc5s5w.jpg"},{"id":269781,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc5s5x.jpg"},{"id":269782,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc5s5y.jpg"}],"summary":"A futuristic 3D puzzle game where you will be tasked to put back together scrambled images.","tags":[268435465,536871013]},{"id":136955,"cover":{"id":138609,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co2yy9.jpg"},"name":"Dai Gyakuten Saiban: Naruhodou Ryuunosuke no Bouken 1&2 - Best Price!","platforms":[{"id":37,"name":"Nintendo 3DS"}],"summary":"Includes The Great Ace Attorney: Ryunosuke Naruhodo’s Adventure – Best Price!, The Great Ace Attorney 2: Ryunosuke Naruhodo’s Resolution, and a mini soundtrack CD with 10 carefully selected songs from The Great Ace Attorney 1&2, all housed in an original design box.","tags":[27,31,43,268435458,268435465,268435487,268435490,536871127,536880246]},{"id":11777,"cover":{"id":139447,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co2zlj.jpg"},"name":"Saenai Heroine no Sodatekata -blessing flowers-","platforms":[{"id":46,"name":"PlayStation Vita"}],"screenshots":[{"id":12463,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/vfezpbvryfyelllvcxaq.jpg"},{"id":12464,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/zloa8goem1eiwtibmzr9.jpg"},{"id":12465,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/wurb0nhmvirj44pj6dgu.jpg"},{"id":12466,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/zy8ojzxrn6reqcwyvje2.jpg"},{"id":12467,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/golzll269nx5m5jvyl8b.jpg"}],"summary":"Saenai Heroine no Sodatekata -blessing flowers- is a Japanese visual novel based on the Saenai Heroine no Sodatekata light novel franchise.
