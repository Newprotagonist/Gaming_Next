It's pretty much a straight knock off of platformers like Sonic, but it does so with charm, personality, and bags of entertainment. The story revolves around the adventures of a little blue hedgehog (Sonic's sister perhaps?) and finds her travelling through an array of colorful environments, although it's not entirely clear why this should be necessary. In classic platform fashion, she runs around, leaps a bit and dashes at the many enemies which litter her path. In similar style to the Kirby games, you can absorb the power of defeated enemies which comes in handy during later stages, while you can also throw rocks at the bad guys a la Super Mario Bros 2. There are also Sonic-style springboards and the environments you travel through are your standard cutesy platformer-type levels. Adventures of Sting is certainly not shy about where it gets its inspiration from but while this criminal lack of originality has killed many other games in the past, here it seems to work to its advantage and actually results in a curiously enjoyable little title. The game gets off to a great start with its lush visuals which are just bursting with color and personality and with some lovely environments to discover. The controls are easy to pick up, while the platforming itself is largely entertaining and although not overly challenging, maybe this isn't such a big deal. All in all, something of a forgotten gem.","tags":[268435464],"videos":[{"id":34354,"video_id":"j8xrbA1Hhzs"}]},{"id":26896,"cover":{"id":107460,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co2ax0.jpg"},"name":"Dragons Be","platforms":[{"id":6,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}],"screenshots":[{"id":36111,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/goa4i98xwngneprof4we.jpg"},{"id":36112,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/jeoguv9nqctxa7qngmam.jpg"},{"id":36113,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/gbdwsvafeaxblglwwwok.jpg"},{"id":36114,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/bivaqygphowi8uuygdcz.jpg"},{"id":36115,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/jcnwclerqtlxshksbmuh.jpg"}],"summary":"Dragons wreaking havoc!

While your mission sounds fairly basic, it won't be easy; there are seven other pilots vying for the same prize. Residing in the far reaches of the Milky Way, competition includes a half man/half machine humanoid named Ko-Axe, the vengeful Tianna Stone, and an overconfident egomaniac that goes by the name of Dextor -- The Terrible. There are also drone pilots that fill in the rest of the playing field. \n \nBroken into quadrants, there are 44 different rails/tracks in which to race on; there are ten races per quadrant. While the bulk of the game is played against computer-controlled opposition, there are times when you'll race against the clock in a true test of speed and accuracy.

Terrorists (the Ketars, the villains of the first game Driller) hijacked the moon's facilities and built Zephyr One, an immense beam weapon on the moon's dark side with the purpose of destroying Evath. The player is a government agent, sent secretly to the moon's surface with the mission of deactivating the weapon before it becomes fully charged. This is accomplished by destroying a power network in the form of ECD (Energy Collection Device) columns, dotted around the moon and connected with power lines all the way to the beam weapon. \nAn ECD (Energy Collection Device) column. To destroy the ECD, the player needs to shoot the top part of the column. \n \nTo complete the mission, the player has at his disposal an arsenal of beam weapons mounted on a jetpack equipped pressure suit. The aim is to destroy all ECDs in a specific order and avoid capture and death by the traps left by the terrorists. ECDs are connected to power lines and can only be destroyed when all preceding ECDs have been deactivated, otherwise they will instantly regenerate. The player has limited amount of time available to complete the game, based on the energy accumulated in Zephyr One. When the weapon is fully charged, the beam is fired destroying Evath and the game ends. As the player destroys ECDs, the charge accumulation rate is reduced, allowing more time for the player to complete the mission. \n \nThe game's environment is displayed in first person view with the player seeing the world through the suit's helmet. A targeting crosshair displayed in the helmet's HUD allowing the player to fire the suit's weapon at specific locations. The player can move in all directions by walking or activating the jetpack. The suit is powered by an energy source that gets depleted with every movement and it is allocated between \"shields\" and \"fuel\". When the shields charge is depleted, the player is vulnerable to enemy fire and simply bumping into walls can end the game.

You, as Blue, are a specialist of the Leaf Dump, and you love Princess Fa of the Raguy family. Unfortunately, Princess Fa has fallen sick from the pollution. It's your job to save your princess in Blue's Journey, a 2D side-scrolling platformer with RPG elements. Go through stages jumping on platforms and avoiding traps, while dealing with a multitude of bad guys, with a special bad guy boss at the end of every level to defeat with special means. To help with this, Blue can use a leaf attack and shrink. The leaf attack, only used when Blue is full sized, lets Blue slam a leaf that stuns any enemies he hits. Blue can also pick up power-ups for a more devastating leaf attack, or change his attack entirely. When the enemies are stunned, Blue can pick them up and throw them across the screen to dispose of more baddies. Shrunken down Blue can't use his attacking power, but he can fit into small crevasses and crannies not normally accessible. Of course, Blue can also dispatch enemies by jumping on them. Since Raguy's economy is flower based, Blue can collect flowers to buy things at special huts. But Blue must take care not to fall into traps or bottomless pits, which cause instant death. Being hit by bad guys or their shots is just as bad. Blue starts the game with two hearts, losing one when he gets whacked by a bad guy. When his heart count goes to zero, Blue dies. Play the game alone (as Blue), or with your friend (as a green Blue) for two-player simultaneous fun.","tags":[268435464]},{"id":83818,"name":"声之寄托SP","platforms":[{"id":6,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}],"screenshots":[{"id":197738,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc4hqdqikjcmyzuzczg7.jpg"},{"id":197739,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/qm1fqsgzw178gahovgcy.jpg"},{"id":197740,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/bg2z37whwlmubglacfq5.jpg"},{"id":197741,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/ptpjv9hvs8pmod3rqa2l.jpg"},{"id":197742,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/jnavjsgojrg9anu2tg7l.jpg"}],"summary":"Escape by means of \"Voice\"! \nThe second installment of the new feeling puzzle and escape game! \nYou are being held in a room that you haven't been to before. \nThe only thing you can do is using telephone to ask for hint from a cooperator.","tags":[268435468,268435487,268435488]},{"id":7616,"cover":{"id":8718,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/c48iufb2cdcb6ite1nc6.jpg"},"name":"NERO - Neuro-Evolving Robotic Operatives","platforms":[{"id":6,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}],"summary":"NERO is an example of a new genre of games, called Machine Learning Games.

In the first phase individual players deploy agents, i.e. simulated robots, in a \"sandbox\" and train them to the desired tactical doctrine. Once a collection of robots has been trained, a second phase of play (either battle or territory mode) allows players to pit their robots in a battle against robots trained by some other player, to see how effective their training was. The training phase is the most innovative aspect of game play in NERO, and is also the most interesting from the perspective of AI research.","tags":[18,268435469,268435471,536871487]},{"id":105425,"name":"PENGUIN HOP","platforms":[{"id":37,"name":"Nintendo 3DS"}],"screenshots":[{"id":440578,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc9fya.jpg"}],"summary":"Ready to cool down?","tags":[268435465,268435471,268435487,268435489]},{"id":67922,"name":"TOREj 3","platforms":[{"id":6,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}],"screenshots":[{"id":124830,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/hpxakacuxl8doyni4pur.jpg"},{"id":124831,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/hzgbjad3cpmsgkiqfaxq.jpg"},{"id":124832,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/mizeiw7yvluil2xvshfo.jpg"},{"id":124833,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/jzonxomdugg9atolrfyw.jpg"},{"id":124834,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/orbqoxcfnzoorfcwaohd.jpg"}],"summary":"TOREj 3 is a puzzle game where the goal is to build a tower without it collapsing and falling of the platform.

Aside from the standard enemies, boxes, and gems, there are various hidden bonuses you can get for extra points.","tags":[268435461]},{"id":66500,"cover":{"id":220258,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co4pya.jpg"},"name":"Nikujin","platforms":[{"id":6,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}],"screenshots":[{"id":786930,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scgv76.jpg"},{"id":786931,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scgv77.jpg"},{"id":786932,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scgv78.jpg"},{"id":786933,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scgv79.jpg"},{"id":786934,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scgv7a.jpg"}],"summary":"A freeware independent title starring a nudist ninja in a platformer/action game.","tags":[1,27,268435464,536870973,536871029,536871076,536871262,536872407,536872873,536872961,536873067]},{"id":48377,"name":"Bomb Sweeper","platforms":[{"id":18,"name":"Nintendo Entertainment System (NES)"}],"summary":"Bomb Sweeper is a clone of Nintendo's Game & Watch \"BombSweeper\" from 1987.

One player need only one hand and half of gamepad to play the game. Players split into two teams. You can play as an defective robot, where your goal is to destroy as many robots as you can, or you can play as an overseer to seek and find defective robots. Gameplay is heavily inspired by Hidden in Plain Sight. With Overlook we want to push Hidden in Plain Sight to the next level. \n \nYou can support us on Kickstarter: https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1389951827/overlook-local-multiplayer-game-up-to-16-players?ref=ahkvjy \n \n# Overview \n \nOverlook is a game of moves plays and observation skills. It’s ideal for a small or big group of friends. Put your skills to the test and find out who can outplay the rest! You will often have to keep a cool head and try to mislead the opposite team in order to achieve victory. It’s not an easy task – the clock is ticking and time isn’t always in your favour. You will have to split into two teams choosing between infected robots and overseers. Thanks to game’s flexibility and party gameplay features Overlook supports 2-16 players on a single PC or console (up to 8 gamepads required). \n \n# Two Teams \n## Defective Robots \nWhen game starts you see a map full of robots. Your first goal is… to locate yourself! Try not to move too quickly because overseers are watching! When you establish your current position it’s time to infect as many robots as you can. Keep in mind that the game hides the position of infected robots until overseer puts his marker on top of them. This allows you to move freely and spread the infection, if you remain far away from your opponent’s markers. Put your skill to test and try to mislead the opposite team for as long as you can. Don’t get caught red-handed! \n \n## Overseers \nYour job is to find players from the other team and remove them from the game. Move your marker along the map and try to locate infected robots. You can examine the status of the robots only by pointing directly at them. Move quickly and try to find out who is spreading the infection! If you find any robot suspicious, mark your target and watch the tongs remove it from the game. Be careful – the number of your hits is limited!","tags":[1,23,40,268435471,268435488,536873278],"videos":[{"id":17167,"video_id":"eVFFkfqHlec"},{"id":19524,"video_id":"jXR0dHV-sbw"}]},{"id":50562,"name":"Hello Kitty no Magical Museum","platforms":[{"id":22,"name":"Game Boy Color"}],"summary":"Hello Kitty no Magical Museum is a Puzzle game, developed by Atelier Double and published by Imagineer, which was released in Japan in 1999.","tags":[268435465]},{"id":75712,"cover":{"id":108465,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co2box.jpg"},"name":"Immortal Heroes","platforms":[{"id":3,"name":"Linux"},{"id":6,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"},{"id":14,"name":"Mac"}],"screenshots":[{"id":134721,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/gpla26xga5ulzlmtikxt.jpg"},{"id":134722,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/vujwlxzjwpm8yuerqp0i.jpg"},{"id":134723,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/vqsuwbkap0v7jdv8khuo.jpg"},{"id":134724,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/ifnaldk9lx2gndygolnj.jpg"},{"id":134725,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/kjwwzwb4yhbfb79tp7yh.jpg"}],"summary":"You are a brave warrior who came to this world to save its inhabitants. \nHere you will be met by awful monsters, such as huge spiders, wolf-werewolves, bears, unicorns ... \nThe essence of the game, like any clicker, is to quickly press the button to the finish.","tags":[268435487,268435488]},{"id":35498,"name":"StarFence: Heroic Edition","platforms":[{"id":6,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}],"screenshots":[{"id":86322,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/rzc4rh7zm4rs6hc4dkwl.jpg"},{"id":86323,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/oqshnmiv8bb2vxwgty8y.jpg"},{"id":86324,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/bgge4x0dtgescji3rgok.jpg"},{"id":86325,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/m2heczpbsy7xsbhvnw0o.jpg"},{"id":86326,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/fgxi2k53yfjekjp3o98v.jpg"}],"summary":"Beautiful space shooter with addictive hurricane gameplay and tons of fun!

Custom-built, open-source relativistic graphics code allows the speed of light in the game to approach the player’s own maximum walking speed. Visual effects of special relativity gradually become apparent to the player, increasing the challenge of gameplay. These effects, rendered in realtime to vertex accuracy, include the Doppler effect (red- and blue-shifting of visible light, and the shifting of infrared and ultraviolet light into the visible spectrum); the searchlight effect (increased brightness in the direction of travel); time dilation (differences in the perceived passage of time from the player and the outside world); Lorentz transformation (warping of space at near-light speeds); and the runtime effect (the ability to see objects as they were in the past, due to the travel time of light). Players can choose to share their mastery and experience of the game through Twitter. A Slower Speed of Light combines accessible gameplay and a fantasy setting with theoretical and computational physics research to deliver an engaging and pedagogically rich experience.","tags":[17,34,268435469,268435488,536871220,536871446,536871964,536872060,536872513]},{"id":15954,"cover":{"id":21024,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/i3ni3g1igiqf5wyya98r.jpg"},"name":"Eternity's Child","platforms":[{"id":6,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}],"screenshots":[{"id":45632,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/tbacwoffj5j89xlh6yas.jpg"},{"id":45633,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/z3brv30jigfm9q8hgikf.jpg"},{"id":45634,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/hg0j600viverjgt92ln5.jpg"},{"id":45635,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/xd8pbci7xiemf2warzzw.jpg"},{"id":45636,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/z9fi7infri45h0lnecxx.jpg"}],"summary":"Eternity's Child, a quirky, hand drawn next generation 2D platformer is based on a fairy tale by Luc Bernard.

There was no shortage of martial artists who entered the tournament seeking fame, and yet there were many who left the tournament as corpses. The last challenger who remains in this lawless tournament gets to challenge the organizer of the tournament, the Head of the Huang Financial Clique, for the chance to win the massive prize money. The martial artist who can manage to defeat him will obtain the honor of truly calling him or herself the strongest. However, none of the martial artists who were chosen to challenge the champion in a private final match have ever come back alive. Nobody knows when exactly the tournament is held, since only an avaricious will was spiraling over there. The sponsor is actually an evil spirit who possessed the body of a modern man from Hong Kong who has established a selection system to amplify his dark powers. The FIST tournament has gathered numerous participants from around the globe and another sacrifice will be chosen this year.","tags":[18,268435460,268435465,268435487,536871130,536871882,536871905,536871939,536873787]},{"id":16533,"cover":{"id":94755,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co2143.jpg"},"name":"Edge of Space","platforms":[{"id":6,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}],"screenshots":[{"id":100657,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/ksoqu8i1ybw6gb3lexp8.jpg"},{"id":100658,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/kq2y0ac8lma25v3ezbli.jpg"},{"id":100659,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/nfqlqsvbagf6chfbt1wk.jpg"},{"id":100660,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/ald0dkdalgxqvsgi6o6q.jpg"},{"id":100661,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/jjvkiie8nrfylivynhlc.jpg"}],"summary":"Suit up as an operative of the Ark Corporation, sent to the farthest reaches of the universe in search of habitable planets to terraform.

While you can play EmptyEpsilon alone or with friends, the best experience involves 6 players working together on each ship. \n \nEach officer fills a unique role: Captain, Helms, Weapons, Relay, Science, and Engineering. Except for the Captain, each officer operates part of the ship through a specialized screen. The Captain relies on their trusty crew to report information and follow orders. \n \nLike Artemis Spaceship Bridge Simulator? \nArtemis Spaceship Bridge Simulator was the inspiration for EmptyEpsilon. It's pretty good as a bridge simulator, but we had some issues with it that we wanted to fix. Since Artemis isn't open source, our only solution was to start over by ourselves. \n \nFor example, the \"comms\" station of Artemis is pretty limited and can be boring for the player. The game could fall out of sync, confusing the players. Also, its Game Master screen didn't do everything that we wanted. \n \nAll in all, Artemis is a nice game.

It is the result of a collaboration between Square and The Walt Disney Company. The game combines characters and settings from Disney's animated features with those from the Final Fantasy series, developed by Square.\n\nKingdom Hearts was a departure from Square's standard role-playing games by introducing a substantial action-adventure element. In addition, it has an all-star voice cast which included many of the Disney characters' official voice actors. Kingdom Hearts was longtime Square character designer Tetsuya Nomura's first time in a directorial position.\n\nThe game uses an experience based progression system, with experience gained by defeating foes. Experience gained rises in relation to the strength of the foe, and is consistent for each enemy over the course of the game. Levels are gained with experience, and provide increases to stat attributes in strength, defence, magic, hit points, magic points and ability points, with a new, predetermined ability unlocked approximately every four levels.","tags":[1,17,27,268435468,268435487,536870916,536871139,536871148,536871186,536871208,536871213,536871262,536871409,536871470,536871506,536871635,536871758,536871938,536871945,536871987,536872119,536872201,536872225,536872293,536872647,536873236,536873384,536874098,536874398,536874745,536875050,536875073,536875074,536875105,536875157,536875178,536875196,536875199,536875232,536875241,536875271,536875292,536875294,536875301,536875308,536875318,536875330,536875340,536875364,536875380,536875437,536875453,536875455,536875482,536875523,536875559,536875590,536875597,536875621,536875637,536875639,536875695,536875758,536875778,536875791,536875803,536875819,536875822,536875830,536875852,536875868,536875870,536875896,536875930,536875934,536875952,536876017,536876027,536876125,536876208,536876232,536876266,536876281,536876286,536876316,536876365,536876402,536876499,536876506,536876540,536876551,536876573,536876595,536876651,536876678,536876722,536876764,536876769,536876847,536876848,536876875,536876919,536876976,536877000,536877006,536877016,536877029,536877037,536877057,536877129,536877130,536877131,536877135,536877136,536877139,536877172,536877237,536877276,536877405,536877406,536877424,536877554,536877632,536877690,536877780,536878193,536878236,536878345,536878440,536878441,536878465,536878555,536878564,536878589,536879206,536879696,536879716,536879756,536879806,536879887,536879992,536880121,536880137,536880188,536880240,536880243,536880274,536880286,536880312,536880359,536880415,536880441,536880443,536880469,536880573,536880706,536880891,536880943,536881125,536881516,536881656,536881768,536881990,536882169,536882421,536883241,536883263,536883361,536884029,536884030,536884829,536886470],"videos":[{"id":2275,"video_id":"NVXGKfxWAI4"},{"id":2276,"video_id":"c9-hdtsy0fA"},{"id":2277,"video_id":"ABxvDcPpJHw"}]},{"id":82415,"cover":{"id":58508,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sfrzyg9bbxocyz7w2xpl.jpg"},"name":"Speedboat Challenge","platforms":[{"id":49,"name":"Xbox One"}],"screenshots":[{"id":146595,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/otv6l3wgt8ga1kkqzsbs.jpg"},{"id":146596,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/qyedppspp6hgee6aedgu.jpg"},{"id":146597,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/mjalripgkm0tffvl0e3h.jpg"},{"id":146598,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/a8ipvfqb5hzxz24msxxo.jpg"},{"id":146599,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/og5k0shebhpbmucqu6fy.jpg"}],"summary":"Take the challenge and drive against the best pilots of the world!\n\nSpeedboat Challenge is a high quality motorboat race simulation.

Eternal War expands upon the gameplay formula of Quake by introducing additional features and playing modes.\n\nMike's journey spans 17 levels, which can be completed either in single-player mode or in co-op with other players. There is also another game mode called Flood, which involves fending off waves of demons and sealing the gates through which they come. This is primarily a multiplayer mode, but it can also be played with friendly bots.\n\nThe game's setting has strong medieval fantasy motives. The eight weapons at the player's disposal either come from a medieval arsenal (dagger, crossbow, sword) or are various holy spells like Smite and Trinity Blast which are powered by manna. Essentially, most weapons function similarly to those of Quake. However, each also has an alternate firing mode that can be toggled at any time. Alternate attacks deal more damage at the cost of increased ammo consumption.\n\nThe monsters also have medieval fantasy designs, sometimes reminiscent of Heretic or Hexen. These include zombies, levitating necromancers and various humanoid fighters in medieval attire. Many of the enemies have special abilities and alternate attacks, making them even more dangerous.\n\nOne special feature unique to Eternal War is the player's ability to pray, which allows Mike to regain full health. It is not possible to fight while praying, but the player is surrounded by an aura that will banish any demons that might try to attack him.","tags":[17,268435461,536871063,536871087,536871138,536871139,536871335,536871365,536871727,536871809,536871816,536871836,536871981,536872232,536873025,536875048,536875215,536875242,536875306,536875437,536875609,536876328,536876330,536876706,536876934,536877952,536878360,536890382,536890968]},{"id":22375,"aggregated_rating":64.0,"cover":{"id":102612,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co276c.jpg"},"name":"Strikers Edge","platforms":[{"id":6,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"},{"id":48,"name":"PlayStation 4"}],"screenshots":[{"id":48607,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/ikz2kompndez4e9z8e1c.jpg"},{"id":48608,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/miwuudruc5evs40yefki.jpg"},{"id":48609,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/g9e5glbuivahlpyxsgfe.jpg"},{"id":48610,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/uwpp0ljck5pwh8mzbv8l.jpg"},{"id":48611,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/qdj9wwqozfxxf9diqjhy.jpg"}],"summary":"\"Strikers Edge is an intense, online multiplayer ranged combat game, where you play as an ancient warrior.\"\n\n\"Play online or locally as one of 8 unique strikers across 4 different arenas.\nClimb the ranked online ladder, achieve greatness and become the top striker!\"","tags":[1,17,22,40,268435460,268435470,268435488,268435489,536871019,536871026,536871029,536871063,536871197,536871208,536871551,536871587,536872465,536872617,536875046,536875378,536888283],"videos":[{"id":9303,"video_id":"dsyEyfv0fWE"}]},{"id":108345,"cover":{"id":82510,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co1rny.jpg"},"name":"Nightmare Of Melanie","platforms":[{"id":6,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}],"screenshots":[{"id":247281,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/ofgguys5phjmxhccaki9.jpg"},{"id":247282,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/urrrwph9xzwlkmmapx1s.jpg"},{"id":247283,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/ifwq4bsxq0trfmqmcb7t.jpg"},{"id":247284,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/o6gl2dititms8863yxqb.jpg"},{"id":247285,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/kq7xj6kjsqtts9ocmirh.jpg"},{"id":247286,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/ldgnp4ymigkmqpg4iqaf.jpg"},{"id":247287,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/hh5rb66gzsb40trogv6s.jpg"},{"id":247288,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/tzov2zpndztm1ofylilx.jpg"},{"id":247289,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/e5epkuhlaipqmri78snx.jpg"},{"id":247290,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/k9jbmnkgkfcqs8apat7d.jpg"},{"id":247291,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/jqtluih5ymdkdjvv5ovx.jpg"},{"id":247292,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/ftxhcuegon2tl7tmnbxx.jpg"}],"summary":"玩家将以泠的视角在真相和恐惧之间不断体会自己的内心深处的呼唤，视野一层一层清晰、被恐惧一次一次的席卷过后，面对那隐藏在最深处黑暗之中的最为残酷的命运……","tags":[268435468,268435469,268435471,268435487,268435488]},{"id":191292,"cover":{"id":208067,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co4gjn.jpg"},"name":"The Tribe Game","platforms":[{"id":6,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"},{"id":14,"name":"Mac"}],"screenshots":[{"id":757890,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scg8si.jpg"},{"id":757891,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scg8sj.jpg"},{"id":757892,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scg8sk.jpg"},{"id":757893,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scg8sl.jpg"},{"id":757894,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scg8sm.jpg"},{"id":757895,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scg8sn.jpg"},{"id":757896,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scg8so.jpg"},{"id":757897,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scg8sp.jpg"},{"id":757898,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scg8sq.jpg"},{"id":757899,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scg8sr.jpg"},{"id":757900,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scg8ss.jpg"},{"id":757901,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scg8st.jpg"},{"id":757902,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scg8su.jpg"},{"id":757903,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scg8sv.jpg"}],"summary":"The Tribe Game is a story-driven video game where the player gets to create their own custom character and step into the world of The Tribe.
