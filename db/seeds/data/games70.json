Select your favorites and nurture them to adulthood. Feeding them, petting them, and cleaning up their messes is a great way to form a lasting bond. Each animal's personality will change depending on how you take care of them. Watch them get spoiled, turn into over-eaters, and more as they grow on a daily basis. Some animals will even have a baby on occasion, and once it's born, you've got another mouth to feed. Game time passes much more quickly than real time, and the different animal types are active at various hours--some during the day, and some at night. Sometimes it's fun to just kick back and watch what they do. So what are you waiting for? It's time to create your own personal zoo.","tags":[34,268435469,536871446,536872060]},{"id":114333,"cover":{"id":169691,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co3mxn.jpg"},"name":"Catalyst","platforms":[{"id":6,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}],"screenshots":[{"id":281527,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc6187.jpg"},{"id":281528,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc6188.jpg"},{"id":281529,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc6189.jpg"},{"id":281530,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc618a.jpg"},{"id":281531,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc618b.jpg"}],"summary":"Catalyst is an interactive narrative into the world on psychotherapy.

This means the most important aspect is learning enemy placements, their patterns and how to avoid them. But he has to hurry because of the time limit.

Survival lets you put your skydiving skills to the test.\n\nDas Überleben is a multiplayer skydiving game, with 8-bit retro graphics. The story is that you've gone skydiving, but your plans have gone horribly wrong!\n\nThis means you have to skydive through lots of obstacles, trying to reach your landing point. Your plans have gone so wrong, that you may be skydiving through a mine, a molten volcano, or even Star Wars' Death Star!\n\nControls are via keyboard, mouse or gamepad, and if you have enough controllers, can handle up to seven players! There are lots of options, which is pretty cool: difficulty settings, spin settings (which can be very disorientating!), multiplayer fighting and more. The sound is limited to rushing wind and a little ambient noise, like rain on the tree level. for such a simple game, it's quite engrossing and hypnotic.\n\nDas Überleben is also quite hard! The levels seem to be randomly generated so you can't learn them, and you really have to concentrate to stop yourself from being splattered into a wall. However, the random levels give you more longevity along with the difficulty settings and the insane spinning effect! Collected rings increase your speed as you dive.\n\nYou can invite up to six other players to pop by on a split screen, pushing them away to be the solo survivor!\n\nDas Überleben is an atmospheric and exciting retro looking game, great for solo and multi-player games alike.","tags":[1,268435464,536871551,536871615,536872287],"videos":[{"id":55138,"video_id":"9yzxkGfYe28"},{"id":55156,"video_id":"SCF-1OKJQcw"}]},{"id":150138,"cover":{"id":166737,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co3knl.jpg"},"name":"Hellwomb","platforms":[{"id":6,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}],"screenshots":[{"id":473432,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sca5aw.jpg"}],"summary":"Hellwomb is a horror themed shooter made for the E1M1 game jam","tags":[19,268435461,268435488]},{"id":81795,"name":"Click&Fight","platforms":[{"id":6,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}],"screenshots":[{"id":145146,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/zdicrifkdxpr5yxnryve.jpg"},{"id":145147,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/apdlbfwyg3lo6ez0c4uu.jpg"},{"id":145148,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/ynwgt0e8zrw9t2jto87y.jpg"},{"id":145149,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/ak4e6mnyarpswdxnock4.jpg"},{"id":145150,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sltagbblp3s1tumpjyy4.jpg"}],"summary":"Click and fight as long, as you can!

The game was written by Dave Lebling and inspired by the horror fiction writings of H. P. Lovecraft (including his Cthulhu Mythos). Like most of Infocom's games, it was released for several platforms simultaneously thanks to the Z-machine.\n\nThe original release included versions for DOS, the Apple II, Atari ST, Atari 8-bit family and Commodore 64. Later, it was ported to the Amiga with the addition of sound effects, making it the first title with that feature. The effects would play at appropriate times in the game in an effort to intensify the horror atmosphere. This marked one of the few major additions to the Z-machine with the exception of graphics; traditionally, Infocom had eschewed such changes in favor of expanding the parser capacity and overall size of game files. It was Infocom's 26th game; Infocom rated it as \"Standard\" in terms of difficulty. Lurking Horror was the only horror game ever released by Infocom.","tags":[19,268435487,536871130]},{"id":9047,"aggregated_rating":85.0,"cover":{"id":181992,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co3wfc.jpg"},"name":"Besiege","platforms":[{"id":3,"name":"Linux"},{"id":6,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"},{"id":11,"name":"Xbox"},{"id":14,"name":"Mac"},{"id":49,"name":"Xbox One"},{"id":169,"name":"Xbox Series X|S"}],"screenshots":[{"id":19579,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/zbrpig12rhx1lngt2teu.jpg"},{"id":34295,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/gyyxudbhp6qjfmxfikff.jpg"},{"id":34296,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/iiijs9d1kerodijyeoo0.jpg"},{"id":34297,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/e6smrotrkpjtf5rhytnn.jpg"},{"id":34298,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/wdwpmd3zdkqe8gjg3o1n.jpg"}],"summary":"Besiege is a physics based building game in which you construct medieval siege engines and lay waste to immense fortresses and peaceful hamlets.\n\nBuild a machine which can crush windmills, wipe out battalions of brave soldiers and transport valuable resources, defending your creation against cannons, archers and whatever else the desperate enemies have at their disposal.","tags":[1,22,33,39,268435465,268435469,268435471,268435488,536870967,536871033,536871063,536871465,536871887,536872060,536872130,536874694,536875060,536875939,536876597,536877043],"videos":[{"id":3506,"video_id":"xOm-qmmp7KU"},{"id":3507,"video_id":"n-aG7E9gTNI"}]},{"id":18308,"cover":{"id":14580,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/wz4xey3kvdeod7oeleom.jpg"},"name":"Vampire Legends: Power of Three","platforms":[{"id":20,"name":"Nintendo DS"}],"tags":[268435468,536871123]},{"id":30562,"cover":{"id":184623,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co3ygf.jpg"},"name":"Rescue the Great Demon 2","platforms":[{"id":3,"name":"Linux"},{"id":6,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"},{"id":14,"name":"Mac"}],"screenshots":[{"id":72650,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/q6ezjk285zi7jwpzxylv.jpg"},{"id":72651,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/eawh3c85cipw43pbkxbo.jpg"},{"id":72652,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/jbseiwcxgblg474hw8xp.jpg"},{"id":72653,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/pyfegdcjaphk0dizqump.jpg"},{"id":72654,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/hixrdiedvpzr47qpqhyu.jpg"}],"summary":"Sino was controlled by human.
