Players draw magical runes to combat the creatures they encounter in turn-based RPG battles with status effects and elements to consider.

It was released on October 27, 2009 and the second game on Madagascar\u0027s spin-off series. \n \nGameplay[edit] \nThe game is a basic kart racing game, and the player can perform jumps, flips, rolls.[1] There are many different stages from scenes of the franchise.[1] Playable characters include Alex, Marty, Gloria, Melman, King Julien, Mason and Phil, or all four of the penguins.[1] The Madagascar Kartz Wheel is bundled with the Wii version of the game. This wheel is optional. This wheel\u0027s look is different from that of the Wii Wheel from Mario Kart Wii.[1] \n \nPlayable characters include Alex the Lion, Marty the Zebra, Melman the Giraffe, Gloria the Hippotamus, The Penguins, The Chimps, and King Julien from the Madagascar. Two characters from other movies are included alongside the Madagascar, Shrek from Shrek, and B.O.B. from Monsters vs. Aliens, all DreamWorks Animation franchises. Race types include Quick Race, Championship, Time Trial and Checkpoint race. A Championship race is one where the player collects mangoes and tries to finish first place in order to unlock higher speed classes (50cc, 100cc, 150cc, 200cc, the last one is raced in reverse direction/mirror mode), more karts and tracks. In Time Trial, players beat their own times and earn medals (gold, silver and bronze). In Checkpoint Race, players collect as many hourglasses as they can before the time runs out. There are several tracks in the game. Also, in a track, most tracks have 2 shortcuts. \"I Like to Move It\", sung by Reel 2 Real, is the menu theme. The game\u0027s gameplay is similar to those of Mario Kart Wii, by Nintendo. The sequel is Super Star Kartz.",

    "summary": "Once in the game, using the arrow keys you can move the \u0027Scanner\u0027 ship around the \u0027Shield Line\u0027 at the parameter of the playing area. While moving around this edge the ship is protected from the aliens by a shield indicated by a glowing circle around the ship. This shield is not infinite and care should be taken to complete each level as quickly as possible. A counter indicates the level of shield that you have: when it reaches zero then any contact with an alien is deadly whether you are on the \u0027Shield Line\u0027 or not.\nThe idea of the game is to cut areas out of the screen without touching any of the aliens. This is done by pressing the SPACE key which initiates the \u0027Laser Cutter\u0027 and moving off the \u0027Shield Line\u0027 and rejoining it somewhere else. While you are in the process of drawing a line, your shield is inactive and touching an alien is fatal. Similarly, if one of the aliens touches the line then it will send a charge down the line towards you and you must quickly return to the safety of the edge before it reaches you.\n\nWhen you rejoin the \u0027Shield Line\u0027 the area that does not contain the \u0027Boss\u0027 alien will be filled (points are gained by trapping the other aliens) and the \u0027Shield Line\u0027 will be adjusted to surround the area that is left. The level is completed when a certain percentage of the total area has been filled in. This percentage starts at 80% but may increase in the later levels.",

    "summary": "The fourth game in the Wizardry series, The Return of Werdna takes a decidedly different approach from all the games that preceded it. Instead of playing as a party of six player-generated characters, the player controls Werdna himself, the evil Archmage from the first game. It seems that after Werdna was defeated by the party of adventurers who stole his amulet, he was imprisoned at the bottom of his ten-level labyrinth in an eternal slumber to be tortured by nightmares for eternity. Although Werdna was supposed to sleep forever, somehow he has awakened, and now he is out for revenge.\n\nAt the beginning of the game Werdna finds himself in a situation that is singularly unique for most arch-villains: he is stripped of his powers, trapped within his own former stronghold, and filled with the realization that the same traps and monsters he created to keep adventurers out now act as obstacles to his freedom.\n\nWerdna will slowly regain his magical powers as well as have the ability to summon helpful monsters to accompany him on his journey and aid him in combat. Unlike other role-playing games, no experience is awarded for defeating enemies. Instead, Werdna can only become stronger by searching for pentagrams found in the labyrinth. Accessing a new pentagram allows Werdna to summon stronger monsters and restore his health and spellcasting powers. Werdna will have to fight a variety of monsters and guardians, but many of the randomly appearing enemies in the game are parties of adventurers not unlike those who were controlled by the player in the previous three games. In addition, Werdna is being chased by the rather ticked-off ghost of his old enemy Trebor.\n\nThe game features a somewhat tweaked version of the same engine and graphics used in the earlier installments of the series. The difficulty level has been increased due to the lack of an experience points system, which often leaves the player-controlled party underpowered. The labyrinth contains abundant traps and complex mazes. For obvious reasons it is no longer possible to import characters from the previous games. The game features three different endings: a good ending, an evil ending, and a special Grandmaster ending which is often considered to be the single most difficult task to achieve in the entire series.",

Bumping into people, animals, or special objects usually results in a stranger dream.\n\nEach dream can last up to 10 minutes, after which the player will \u0027wake up\u0027, when the screen fades away and the player is sent back to the game\u0027s initial menu. However, if the player falls off a cliff or into a hole in the dream, then the player will wake up immediately. There is a graph that appears at the end of each dream that keeps track of the player\u0027s state of mind; the states are Upper, Downer, Static and Dynamic, as referring to the environments and the general feel of the dream the player just went through. Past states may have effects on later dreams.",

Though your efforts are marred by being the last survivor of the bloody massacre, you are nevertheless hailed as a hero. Surely that entitles you to some well deserved R\u0026R, right? Not if those demonic bastards have anything to say about it. Landing on Earth following your discharge, you open your pod to a world of fire and blood as the demons have invaded your homeworld. With everyone being killed or mutated to extinction, it’s up to you to do what you do best: kick some demon ass, stop this invasion and save the world. Armed with your ever trusty shotgun, chainsaw and BFG 9000, you must once again do battle with Hell’s spawn and find a way to save Earth. But that’s not all. Once you’ve cleaned up this mess, there are 20 more bloodied levels waiting for you in the Master Levels for Doom II. With no-where left to hide and a legion of demons, mutants and the undead wanting your head, there’s only one thing left to do - don your armor, grab the nearest shotgun and blast your fragging way out of here! \n \nThe highly anticipated sequel to DOOM, this GOG release brings not only DOOM II, but also introduces the Master Levels for DOOM II. Twenty never-before-seen levels all with the same acid drenched, hell spawned horror of the originals. Each was created by independent designers and supervised by the demented minds of id Software. You might as well forget about seeing the light of day ever again.",

With his help, he goes after King Einon, a former pupil of the dragon hunter, who has turned to evil.\n\nDragonHeart\u0027s gameplay is quite similar to the Golden Axe series. Hack\u0027n\u0027slash your way through the nine levels of the game, killing dragons, befriending Draco and then going after Einon with Draco\u0027s help (who will toast everything in the way with his flame breath).",

Every day people come to you with their animals, guinea pigs, rabbits, budgerigars, cats, dogs and even horses. Sometimes it can even be necessary to accommodate the animals and take care of them for a couple of days, so that they get well and happy again quickly. Therefore you can build extra stables and accomodations. Feeding, playing with the pets, bear company, but also cleaning up and the daily treatment are your duties. For very demanding horse-patients, you can experience interesting things about horse whispering. But although the work with pets is a lot of fun, even the best vet doctor needs some time out. Then you take your own horse and go for a long ride at the beach, on meadows and fields or through the nearby forest. Stock up new energy to become the best vet doctor of all time.",

In their quest, their paths will cross with the original cast of Tales of Symphonia including Lloyd and Colette, as well as a summon spirit known as Ratatosk who claims to be the lord of all monsters. Advancing the combination of story, characters and real-time battles of Tales of Symphonia, Dawn of the New World introduces a new monster recruitment feature in which players can capture more than 200 unique enemies and train them to actively participate in battle. Players can then feed these monsters to make them more effective, and even evolve them into several new fearsome forms. The game also features an updated real-time battle system that lets players move freely in all directions around the battlefield, execute powerful unison attacks and take advantage of a new elemental alignment system for even more strategic depth. Dawn of the New World gives players complete control over a full roster of Tales of Symphonia characters and ally monsters, letting them customize their adventure party into hundreds of unique combinations.",

No matter where they went, the twins were never apart. And even now that they\u0027ve grown up, their personalities diverging and leading them to different hobbies, they\u0027re still as close as can be. For Ichika, the responsible big sister, looking out for childish, spoiled Futaba has become an everyday occurance, both at home and at school. \n \nBut one day, worried that the twins are growing too close, their mother chastises them, explaining that there\u0027s a difference between being supportive of each other and being codependent. Regardless of how close they are, she says, they can\u0027t stay together forever. With that admonition, the twins\u0027 relationship begins to change. \n \nLurking beneath Ichika\u0027s wish to see Futaba happy is a different feeling, one that torments her. A desire that cannot be fulfilled. And as their relationship changes, Futaba grows restless, seeing her wish to always be by Ichika\u0027s side drifting further and further away. \n \nWhat awaits these twins, who harbor feelings stronger than mere sisterly love?

If you use your right mouse button you can launch an avalanche rocket. And for every enemy you send scurrying back, you get bonus points. All the time, the dragon urges you on like an enthusiastic football coach, cracking jokes and celebrating the hits. He is desperate to fend off the \"creepy Huns\". Mushoot is an addictive game which is simple to play and it is likely to appeal to all ages. \n \nIn the second game, Rooftop Ruckus, you join the sharp-tongued monkey Abu and leap across rooftops putting on lights. It\u0027s a high-speed chase and you have to watch out for the evil genie who comes running after you. The instructions are clear and the animation is excellent. The characters are very engaging and complain if you leave the game too early. Anyone who enjoyed the movie Aladdin will find this game fun and entertaining. You are awarded extra points for picking up bags of gold or for making guards slip. \n \nBoth games can be played solo or with friends and they will appeal to beginners and experts.",

    "summary": "Keep the balance! is a puzzle game, where you have to balance a big weighing scale. The longer it stays in balance the more point you gain. To do this, you have a catapult at your disposal, the objects you need to use to balance the scale are given to you by conveyor belt. One on the left and one on the right. But these objects differ in weight, so you must carefully choose the scales bucket you\u0027re going to put the objects in. To make things worse, all kinds of trouble appear on screen to make it just a little bit more challenging. Like crocodiles that eat object or jokers that throw around playing cards offsetting your carefully balance scale. The game stages 5 different game worlds each divided into 16 levels.",

Our goal is to throw the player into a miserable environment and give them only one objective: to survive. This survival-driven aspect is particularly explicit in MISERY: you only have limited resources at your disposal and have to deal with various threats when you’re at your weakest and most vulnerable. The implication of this is clear: the player is forced to re-think their habits and get used to new and demanding conditions of the Zone as envisaged by MISERY developers.",

Astro Fury contains three skill levels, numerous stages that will end with a final battle against the boss. You are free to get upgrades - if you fight well enough and destroy many aircrafts. Every time you are attacked you need to dodge the bullet, the rocket or whatever you are shot with. Otherwise the number of lives will be decreased. There are 10 big levels with stages inside.

    "summary": "Starting development in 2005 under the codename \"Rapture\", FINAL FANTASY XIV ONLINE was announced in 2009 for Windows and the PlayStation 3.\n\nIt ran on Square Enix\u0027s Crystal Tools middleware engine, which was adjusted to suit the game\u0027s specifications. During development, the team carried over multiple aesthetic elements from FFXI while creating something that stood on its own. Due to several factors, the development was beset by problems that would later have drastic effects on the game. Attempts to bring the game to Xbox 360 consoles fell through due to disagreements with Microsoft about the use of Xbox Live.\n\nAfter its alpha test and a delayed beta test, the game went live on September 30, 2010, remaining active until its servers were closed on November 11, 2012. At launch, the game received a mixed to negative reaction: while the graphics and music met with general praise, other aspects were unanimously panned, including the gameplay, interface, and the general impression of the game being unfinished at launch.\n\nCritic and fan backlash caused Square Enix to pull subscription fees, indefinitely postpone the PlayStation 3 version, and eventually develop an entirely new version of the game called FINAL FANTASY XIV ONLINE: A REALM REBORN. The poor reception has had a serious impact on the FINAL FANTASY series, with both staff and company officials saying that the brand had been damaged.",

It is a cel-shaded locked-view fighting game much like Street Fighter IV, and includes more than a dozen characters from each publisher\u0027s catalog, including contemporary series as well as older classic titles. \n \nThe game features three main modes. First, there is arcade mode, which pits the player against seven randomly-selected characters in order. Next is quest mode, which plays more like a scrolling beat-em-up and tasks the player with fulfilling various time-limited objectives like destroying targets or collecting keys, and which can be played solo or with up to three friend in wireless co-op. Last is the free battle mode, where the player can play a free battle against the computer or a friend via local wireless play. \n \nThe game system is relatively simple; characters have a limited set of moves, but they can be customized per character. Each character can also be upgraded using orbs earned in quest mode to buy new moves. In addition to regular moves, each character also has special super moves, which require use of a special bar which fills as the player lands blows. The player also unlocks assist characters as the game is played, which can be assigned to characters to give special assist moves. \n \nThere is also a database mode where the player can read introductions for each of the playable and assist characters. The full list of featured series are as follows. \n \nFrom Shonen Sunday, characters appear from Zettai Karen Children by Takashi Shiina, Shijō Saikyō no Deshi Kenichi by Syun Matsuena, Inuyasha by Rumiko Takahashi, Hayate no Gotoku! by Kenjiro Hata, Kekkaishi by Yellow Tanabe, Kyūkyoku Chōjin R by Masami Yuuki, ARMS by Kyoichi Nanatsuki and Ryoji Minagawa, Law of Ueki by Tsubasa Fukuchi, Honō no Tenkōsei by Kazuhiko Shimamoto, Flame of Recca by Nobuyuki Anzai, Ushio to Tora by Kazuhiro Fujita, and YAIBA by Gosho Aoyama. \n \nFrom Shonen Magazine, characters appear from Hajime no Ippo by George Morikawa, Air Gear by Oh!great, Fairy Tail by Hiro Mashima, Mahō Sensei Negima! by Ken Akamatsu, Cromartie High School by Eiji Nonaka, Ashita no Joe by Asao Takamori and Tetsuya Chiba, Get Backers by Yuya Aoki and Rando Ayamine, Kotaro Makaritoru! by Tatsuya Hiruta, Samurai Deeper Kyo by Akimine Kamijyo, Tiger Mask by Ikki Kajiwara and Naoki Tsuji, Devilman by Go Nagai, and Cyborg 009 by Shotaro Ishinomori.",

The ship is home to the carnivorous alien horde and something else ... something yet to reveal its true intentions ... something biding its time.

Players can also deploy their \"Super-Zapper\" once per level to clear the screen of enemies. Each level is a different shape, and progressive levels add new enemy types and more of them, requiring ever-faster reflexes.\n\nThe game only offers online play, but two players can control two separate craft and play cooperatively. Players try for their highest score, which is then uploaded and tracked on the game\u0027s online leaderboards.",

    "summary": "The game is a tactical shooter played from a first-person perspective. As the title suggests, a large portion of the game consists of stealth, staking out targets and firing sniper rifles. Bullet trajectories are subject to wind, gravity and flight time, all of which players must account for when taking shots. To simplify this procedure, easier difficulty settings contain indicators that highlight enemies and show precisely where a bullet will hit. \n \nThe main weapons used in the game are silenced pistols, knives and various types of sniper rifles. In missions that are played with characters who are not snipers, the stealth aspect is dropped in favor of faster-paced \"run and gun\" scenarios. An exception to this are spotting missions, in which the primary objective consists of marking targets for a computer-controlled sniper character. \n \nMost of the game takes place in a dense jungle environment. Waypoint overlays at all times display the correct routes through the areas players must traverse. While these routes need not be followed exactly, the level design usually ensures an overall linear path due to obstacle placement and invisible walls. Many waypoints trigger scripted mission events, and some waypoints act as checkpoints, which automatically save the game. \n \nThe single player campaign of Sniper: Ghost Warrior is made up of four separate acts, each of which deals with a different conflict. All acts are split up into various missions, which usually depict the same event from different points of view. For example, in one segment players may be participating in an infantry assault on an enemy camp, while the next segment has them assuming the role of a supporting sniper who backs up the assault. There is downloadable content available for the title that seamlessly continues the story line with three additional campaign missions.",

The gameplay is very similar to Sunsoft\u0027s Batman games, Batman and Batman: Return of the Joker, in that the character can run, jump, punch and duck, although in this game the player can also fly simply by pushing up. There are also some side scrolling flying levels where you can shoot laser/heat vision from your eyes. The game is divided into five scenes with one-four areas with a boss at the end of each area.",

Combined with the unconventional story, it is aimed to be a compact and deep game for a literate and mature audience.",
