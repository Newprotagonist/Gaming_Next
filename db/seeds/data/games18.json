Monsters attack his homeland, and he is forced to flee. After traveling by ship and arriving at the town Bolda, Areios finds out that strange things have been happening in the North Cave near the town. His first mission will be to venture to the North Cave and investigate the matter. Of course, soon Areios finds himself involved in a battle against sinister forces, and commences the longest and most dangerous adventure of his life!\n\nThe game is an action RPG set in the Dragon Slayer universe, with a gameplay style similar to Falcom's other popular series, Ys. Controlling Areios, the player explores the top-down world, visiting towns and fighting monsters in vast outdoor areas and dungeons. Like in Ys series, it is sufficient to \"bump\" into a monster in order to inflict damage. Areios gains hit points and becomes stronger by sustaining damage from enemies and resting. His weapons and armor can gain experience and level up. In many areas, companions will join Areios and help him in combat, controlled by the computer AI.\n\nThe game is divided into chapters; the final stage of each chapter is a side-scrolling/platform level, which Areios has to navigate in order to reach the boss enemy, defeat him, and end the chapter. In such stages, the combat turns into a more familiar action-oriented style, with the player being required to press buttons in time in order to execute attacks and jump.\n\nThere is a day/night cycle in the game, manifested not only in graphical changes, but also in the schedules of townspeople: when it's dark, people will return to their homes and go to sleep, etc.","tags":[1,17,21,22,33,268435464,268435468,536870984,536870990,536871033,536871063,536871075,536871105,536871138,536871139,536871148,536871208,536871213,536871251,536871301,536871304,536871389,536871470,536871632,536871878,536871938,536871945,536871971,536872371,536872425,536872449,536872594,536872647,536872961,536873021,536873065,536873066,536873111,536873154,536873192,536873302,536873326,536873991,536874115,536874398,536874414,536874745,536874994,536875042,536875067,536875073,536875085,536875106,536875127,536875132,536875161,536875184,536875185,536875196,536875229,536875258,536875300,536875304,536875306,536875309,536875311,536875330,536875342,536875356,536875372,536875396,536875401,536875420,536875453,536875455,536875523,536875525,536875621,536875689,536875699,536875738,536875762,536875770,536875790,536875809,536875830,536875832,536875837,536875870,536875896,536875930,536875942,536875951,536876007,536876031,536876036,536876093,536876199,536876232,536876233,536876312,536876319,536876348,536876352,536876388,536876490,536876522,536876528,536876704,536876730,536876808,536876974,536877006,536877035,536877162,536877303,536877390,536877394,536877453,536877454,536878078,536878079,536878146,536878306,536878309,536878324,536878361,536878494,536878525,536879148,536879215,536879788,536880092,536880168,536880218,536880243,536880251,536880444,536880755,536880833,536880968,536881123,536883602]},{"id":19916,"aggregated_rating":26.6666666666667,"cover":{"id":18084,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/lf4oqeyzsqoottgmjzok.jpg"},"name":"Basement Crawl","platforms":[{"id":48,"name":"PlayStation 4"}],"summary":"Weird PS4 title from Bloober Team.","tags":[1,19,536871529,536872245,536875046,536875151]},{"id":20269,"cover":{"id":76020,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co1mno.jpg"},"name":"Radiator 2","platforms":[{"id":3,"name":"Linux"},{"id":6,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"},{"id":14,"name":"Mac"}],"screenshots":[{"id":82164,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/kpxdrivkanchet1fomaj.jpg"},{"id":82165,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/z3xjtvxxirpetekgfnu1.jpg"},{"id":82166,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/aqsjbrnispxckjxiujdg.jpg"},{"id":82167,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/rjbqkigitr9kwkugco8z.jpg"},{"id":82168,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/br48gdylix69uknuwyao.jpg"}],"summary":"A free collection of three short experimental games (Hurt Me Plenty, Succulent, and Stick Shift) about male sexuality, punishing, eating, and driving.","tags":[1,42,268435469,268435488,536871004,536871220,536871999,536872626,536872873,536874498,536894768],"videos":[{"id":8870,"video_id":"iFYCYLsbE1k"}]},{"id":50006,"cover":{"id":49541,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/k4uwlqq7ztcw2iy4356s.jpg"},"name":"Three Lions","platforms":[{"id":7,"name":"PlayStation"},{"id":22,"name":"Game Boy Color"}],"summary":"A Football game made by the Fans for the Fans.

Akin to snowboarding, the sports popularity is spreading like wildfire around the globe. Evolving from a combination of waterskiing, snowboarding, skating and surfing, wakeboarding is not only the world's fastest-growing water board sport but also the most accessible. It can be done on waterski lakes or on the sea. Riders are able to perform amazing BIG AIR tricks (Backwash, Bindings, Edge, Fakie etc), whilst being towed behind a boat, with the use of big boards and big wakes. The rider stands sideways on a shorter, wider board similar in concept to a snowboard. If you have no imagination, look at these shots from real wakeboarding (shot1, shot2, shot3). So now I think you have an idea kind of sport wakeboarding is, so back to the game. \nBig Air Wakeboarding features over eight distinct characters, hundreds of different mind-bending trick combos, multiple jumps and obstacles, real wakeboards from O'Brien, and Darin Shapiro - the 2000 X Games and Pro Wakeboard Tour Champion. In the game you can choose from Career, Competition and Quick Start. In Career mode you have to collect Gas cans, to improve your character over time.These Gas cans unlock new board graphics and improve on the quality of all boards. Gas can also unlock better boats with bigger wakes and more advanced tie-ins.

A primary goal of the project is to fill a gap between game creation tools like Bloxels and more advanced tools like Game Maker Studio. \n \nWith StageMechanic you are not just playing a game someone else made - you have the opportunity to create your own game and to learn from and build on games that others create. \n \nFor the casual aspiring creator, we offer a range of pre-made blocks and characters with different mechanics and creator-defined properties. \nIntermediate level creators can use the built-in Lua interpreter and code editor to modify all of the built in blocks, items, and characters and even create their own original mechanics. In the future users will also be able to easily import their own 3D models create in tools like MagicaVoxel and Tinkercad as well as create their own music, sound effects, etc. \n \nAdvanced users have full acess to the project's C# source code, allowing for infinite custamizability. As a professionally engineered and developed non-trivial project, StageMechanic offers a unique chance for students to move beyond tutorials and get hands on experience in a complex real-world game. \n \nAI Researchers \n \nFuture versions of StageMechanic will include both the Encog neural network library and TensorFlow accessable via the built-in Lua interpreter and code editor, allowing real-time AI experimentation. \n \n2D tile-based game-creation tool users \n \nUsers of game-creation tools like Super Mario Maker and Bloxels will find many of the same concepts in StageMechanic. You can create your own levels using the built-in level editor, play your own levels, share your levels, and play levels created by others. \nUnlike these games, StageMechanic is in 3D space and includes the possibility to script custom game mechanics - allowing for much more complex games. The built-in block and item types helps keep things simple for those just getting started. \n \nGame Developers \n \nStageMechanic is BSD licensed allowing anyone to create their own open-source or commercial games based on our engine.

While there are a few similarities between the two games, Foes of Ali was developed by a different team, Gray Matter and as such, is not regarded as a true prequel. \n \nThe Knockout Kings game series gives the user a chance to compete against numerous real fighters, such as Muhammad Ali, Eric Esch, Marvin Hagler, Sugar Ray Leonard, Oscar De La Hoya, Larry Holmes, Jake LaMotta, Roberto Durán, Alexis Argüello, and Ray Mancini. The duration of a round can be adjusted to either 90 seconds or 3 minutes. In the game's \"slugfest\" mode, fighters can knock each other out at any given moment of the fight, or suffer 6 or 7 knockdowns and still last for the whole fight. There are several differences between Knockout Kings, Knockout Kings 2000, and Knockout Kings 2001 in particular, the most notable being the graphics. \n \nIn Knockout Kings, the boxer sprites, although distinctive, are not facially representative of their real-life counterparts. Championship bouts can last only up to 10 rounds and not for 12 as in real life or 15 as in the past. In between rounds, all that is seen is a ring-card girl. In Career Mode, a fighter is made to retire right after winning the title and defending it for only the first time. A created boxer can fight in Career Mode and Slugfest Mode, but not in Exhibition mode. Although there is a training mode within Career Mode, it is extremely basic. However, 2 aspects that Knockout Kings has which the sequels lack is that the referee does a mandatory eight-count when a fighter is knocked down whereas in the sequels the referee stops the count immediately after a fighter gets up from a knockdown, and, in Career Mode, the result of a fight is afterwards seen on the screen as front-page newspaper headlines. \n \nIn Knockout Kings 2000 for the PS1, the boxer sprites are for the first time facially representative of their real-life counterparts. Championship bouts can last up to 15 rounds. Sound and Music volume can also be adjusted in Option Mode. In between rounds, you may see either a ring-card girl, a replay of a part of the previous round, or your boxer sitting at his corner together with the statistics so far of the bout. Injury to the face of boxers can also be recognized, as well as his mouth-piece flying out if he is hit by a hard punch. A created boxer in Career Mode can now fight in all Modes. The training mode within Career Mode is more specific. You can now control your boxer while he is training and, in the PS1 version, you can also choose the location of your gym. Each boxer in the PS1 version can also be seen entering into the ring just before the bout takes place. There is also a new Mode where the player can see the statistics and biography of all the real-life boxers in the game, and another Mode in which the player can re-live famous classic bouts. The user-interface and intro-theme of the PS1 version is different to the N64 version and there are also more boxers, while the graphics on each version are similar. \n \nKnockout Kings 2001 contains the same improvements as Knockout Kings 2000 and adds more. Whereas fighters in KO Kings and KO Kings 2000 are either \"boxer\" or \"slugger\" style fighters, the styles of fighters in KO Kings 2001 are either \"boxer\", \"slugger\", \"freestyle\", or \"crab\", and these differences of style are very noticeable during bouts. Commentary in KO Kings 2001 is also far more vocal than its predecessors. During Career Mode, your trainer will occasionally talk and give you advice in between rounds as you progress through the bout. A fighter in Career Mode is made to retire after winning the title and defending it for several times. KO Kings 2001 is also the first game of the series to introduce CPU vs CPU bouts and \"fantasy match-ups\" between famous boxers of different eras, and the first to introduce women's boxing, which is accessible in Exhibition Mode.
