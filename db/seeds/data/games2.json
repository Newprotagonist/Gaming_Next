And when it turns out that the island is not completely uninhabited, save the future friend and comrade-in-arms (Friday, who, by the way, has yet to learn Russian) and try to flee by building a balloon out of improvised means and outwitting the pirates.

Some trains are locked until you finish a mission, for example you can only drive monorails until you've finished the commuter and express train missions. All of the game parts, except the menu and station names, are in Japanese.\n\nIn addition or the Meitetsu Nagoya Line, coverage includes Meitetsu Inuyama Line, Meitetsu Minomachi Line and Meitetsu Monkey Park Monorail Line. This was the first version to feature a monorail, and also featured a Meitetsu hybrid light rail route which ran both on regular train lines and as a sort of urban tram on special lanes in city streets. Part of the gameplay of this required the user to stop for regular traffic signals and avoid car traffic. This was the Densha de Go player's first opportunity to drive a vehicle much lighter (and thus shorter stopping distance) than standard trains.\n\nIn this version, the driver must sound the horn before beginning to accelerate out of a station. This is unique to this title. The gameplay, physics, and strictness of this version were all somewhat relaxed compared to previous versions.\n\nThe game was published by Taito for the Sony PlayStation in Japan on January 27, 2000. It was later ported to the PC by Unbalance on December 1, 2000. The PS1 version later received a re-release as part of D3Publisher's Simple 1500 series of budget games, as Simple 1500 Series Vol. 102: The Densha Utenshi - Densha de Go! Nagoyatetsudou-hen, on August 29, 2002.","tags":[32,268435469,536872060,536875058,536875059],"videos":[{"id":48737,"video_id":"hqWQ9VW_ivk"}]},{"id":192042,"cover":{"id":211057,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co4iup.jpg"},"name":"Polgar Magic Detective: Murder Mystery Journey","platforms":[{"id":130,"name":"Nintendo Switch"}],"screenshots":[{"id":740860,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scfvng.jpg"},{"id":740861,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scfvnh.jpg"},{"id":740862,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scfvni.jpg"},{"id":740863,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scfvnj.jpg"},{"id":740864,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scfvnk.jpg"}],"summary":"Will you be able to solve the magical crimes without making a mistake?

Humankind destroyed it almost entirely during the pointless wars and the endless hunt for resources. Life was not possible to sustain anymore. Not on that planet, at least. \n \nAnarchy, struggle and fighting against each other... instead of doing the right thing. That was always the nature of humankind. \n \nThe humans were lucky. They had a savior. A company called 'Guardians' emerged with enough resources to help evacuate most of the population of Earth. They were heroes. A group of the highest military rank joined the Guardian, and formed the 'military council', to supervise all human activities of outer space. \n \nBut humankind had much to learn. \n \nThe first curse was radiation. While humanity was sitting comfortably on Earth, waiting to be saved, they could not even imagine that most of outer space is lethal to human life. They can't survive certain radiation types, and in the end, they did not dare to explore. They did not go anywhere. They were imprisoned in the few gigantic Star Cruisers of the Guardians. \n \nThen the Guardians claimed that humankind can only survive if they are united, and form the future together. Together, they can be safe. It was a principle that was accepted for a short while, but fanaticism started to slowly take over the Guardian leaders. When they began to see the enemy in everyone, even executing people without much reason, the humans finally started to see what kind of people were controlling them. \n \nThis was the time when more than two million people stole ships from the hangars, and left the Guardian Cruisers far behind. A few million followed in the coming years. \n \nThe Guardians declared these people the 'Pirate horde', and finally, they had a reason to unite. Everyone who remained on the Cruisers became a Guardian, and from then on, the Guardian and Pirate became factions. \n \nHistorians tend to call this separation of human factions 'The Shattering'. \n \nTwo hundred years later the Pirate Wars are still devastating, and even on the brink of extinction, humankind keeps on fighting. \n \nAnarchy, struggle and fighting against each other... instead of doing the right thing.

Following the end of the later contest, copies of the Competition cartridge were sold in a Nintendo Power subscribers catalogue. Due to its rarity (the back insert states the print run was of 2,500 copies), the game has become a prized collector item.\n\nThe actual game consists of a few select levels from Donkey Kong Country with the addition of a point counter and a few minor tweaks to encourage scoring, the goal being to score as many points as possible. The tree house and banana cave at the start of Jungle Hijinxs have been disabled and all of the animal tokens in the early levels have been replaced with banana bunches, making it impossible to reach the bonus round without the usage of a cheating device. The player is also given 50 starting extra lives instead of the 5 as in the original game. The game has a time limit of five minutes, which is displayed at the center of the screen. After the allotted time, the game freezes.","tags":[1,268435464,536871971,536872448,536872654,536873558,536875236,536879148,536895518,536896693,536896915,536898000,536900352,536900615,536900616,536900835,536900869,536900870,536901560,536901561,536901562,536901563,536902082]},{"id":19598,"aggregated_rating":76.6,"cover":{"id":111446,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co2dzq.jpg"},"name":"BOXBOXBOY!","platforms":[{"id":37,"name":"Nintendo 3DS"}],"screenshots":[{"id":118815,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/ybucxiwlbdayvr0slht4.jpg"},{"id":118816,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/iuujrbmldhtxo3vvjxj6.jpg"},{"id":118817,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/ssjp2d7z8cbstcxvcru8.jpg"},{"id":153756,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/blnfrbvjgt7lugfkpzix.jpg"},{"id":153757,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/vmdqvfw0kgsyq8foccaz.jpg"},{"id":153758,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/nj5zpnl73ee7anaqiegq.jpg"},{"id":153759,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/vphxmoqzqdbaau9v8ghg.jpg"},{"id":153760,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/xj1u7hglee2hfdxeisiy.jpg"},{"id":153761,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/kddpsl4hpbeucx5yxu6q.jpg"},{"id":153762,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/qdcnmyc9agxl5ty42he4.jpg"},{"id":153763,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/hpg7gluxfb7zmndoceof.jpg"}],"summary":"It's time to think outside the box once again.
