The hero possesses all the skills required to accomplish especially dangerous missions including, getting information about the disposition of hostile military and civil units, assassination of enemy agents and representatives of Wehrmacht’s high-ranking officers and espionage. By the order of his supreme commander Strogov, who passed through a serious retraining, will have to accomplish various top secret missions. His task is to capture spies, saboteurs and gather information about their actions using unique technologies and devices.","tags":[1,23,268435461,268435487,536870931,536870934,536870952,536871041,536871044,536871188,536871213,536871379,536871426,536871470,536871809,536871937,536872070,536872131,536872352,536872647,536874906,536875046,536875050,536875137,536875178,536875191,536875271,536875325,536875437,536875438,536875491,536875492,536875523,536875572,536875642,536875682,536875803,536875804,536875811,536875820,536875902,536875941,536876221,536876262,536876287,536876322,536876356,536876477,536876530,536876564,536876586,536876701,536876801,536876804,536876812,536876833,536876911,536877264,536877319,536877493,536877501,536877512,536877536,536877537,536877645,536877649,536877652,536877679,536877928,536878003,536878025,536878034,536878127,536878259,536878410,536878413,536878420,536878426,536878427,536878533,536878608,536879115,536879605,536879610,536880610,536881431,536882079,536882911],"videos":[{"id":3676,"video_id":"4oLNyNQTIbU"}]},{"id":48259,"cover":{"id":205760,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co4erk.jpg"},"name":"Werewolf: The Last Warrior","platforms":[{"id":18,"name":"Nintendo Entertainment System (NES)"}],"summary":"He's BAD, RAD and extremely MAD - because to a WEREWOLF, there's nothing like revenge!

The king's greed knew no bounds and set out to bankrupt his people by taxing their hard earned acorns. With no acorns to any of the peasant's names they grew angrier and angrier as each day passed. \n \nOn one cold dark evening, the King had sent his loyal tax man to collect the acorns from Charles DeMontequirrel who had refused to pay the unjust nut tax. As the tax man knocked on Charles' wooden door it swung wide open. Charles stood before the tax collector visibly upset as he was scolded for not following the king's unfair decrees. Charles could no longer simply refuse to pay up and wanted only to set things right. He snatched the legal document the collector shoved in his face and tore it to pieces.

Battles are a duel-formatted affair with players and the computer fighting against one another to proceed to the next battle.","tags":[18,268435460,536870990,536871019,536871079,536871213,536871487,536871882,536871971,536872637,536873064,536873208,536874398,536875073,536875075,536875125,536875198,536875274,536875284,536875298,536875406,536875457,536875523,536875719,536875815,536875870,536876113,536876240,536876266,536876273,536876308,536876352,536876471,536876522,536876803,536876805,536876806,536876819,536876820,536876830,536876842,536877277,536877441,536877696,536877938,536878192,536878197,536878199,536878351,536878417,536880227,536881582,536881626,536883325,536883546],"videos":[{"id":35247,"video_id":"bQ9iCjncR8I"}]},{"id":54919,"cover":{"id":219379,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co4p9v.jpg"},"name":"Un:Birthday Song ~Ai wo Utau Shinigami~","platforms":[{"id":6,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}],"screenshots":[{"id":781833,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scgr9l.jpg"},{"id":781834,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scgr9m.jpg"},{"id":781835,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scgr9n.jpg"},{"id":781836,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scgr9o.jpg"}],"summary":"Kanno Hotori was a normal girl leading a normal life.

It would feature characters seen earlier in the franchise, including Queen Slug-for-a-Butt as an enemy, Peter Puppy as an ally, and Princess What's-Her-Name as a love interest for Jim. Billy the Bin would also make a reappearance as one of the bosses.\n\nBy August 2006, Earthworm Jim PSP was reportedly at 80% complete, and more complete gameplay was shown in Las Vegas. Many video game journalists had hands-on playable builds of the game, such as GameSpot, GamesRadar, and IGN.\n\nEarthworm Jim PSP was initially scheduled for a late 2006 release, but this was pushed back to early 2007. When the time came around, the release was extended again to mid-year 2007. This caused concern for expectant fans, since the game had already been delayed once already.\n\nIn response to this fan concern, Andrew Yoon of PSP Fanboy contacted Alissa Bell from Atari, who confirmed the game had been shelved, commenting: \"I believe EWJ PSP is off the roster. May be revisited in the future, but the title is, as I hear it, on hold.\"\n\nFans were generally excited about the Earthworm Jim revival, which makes it surprising why Atari would stall the project. The complicated transfer of Shiny Entertainment from Interplay to Foundation 9, and merging with The Collective to form Double Helix, may have been a contributing factor in the decision to cancel the game.\n\nAccording to Dave Perry, it was due to both Atari and Interplay's financial difficulties, and a row over royalties between Shiny, Interplay, and Atari.","tags":[1,18,27,268435464,268435487,536871357,536872509,536894773,536897351,536897352],"videos":[{"id":48329,"video_id":"1VsSBEXTinM"}]},{"id":129765,"cover":{"id":91622,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co1yp2.jpg"},"name":"Replics","platforms":[{"id":6,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}],"screenshots":[{"id":356559,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc7n4f.jpg"},{"id":356560,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc7n4g.jpg"},{"id":356561,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc7n4h.jpg"},{"id":356562,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc7n4i.jpg"},{"id":356563,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc7n4j.jpg"},{"id":356564,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc7n4k.jpg"},{"id":356565,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc7n4l.jpg"},{"id":356566,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc7n4m.jpg"},{"id":356567,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc7n4n.jpg"}],"summary":"This 3D action adventure is the first part of the Replics Trilogie. \nWe write the year 2057 and mankind have in the meantime the 3.Worldwar behind itself. \nThe life is no longer like that as it once was. \nThe largest part of the planet is contaminated and uninhabitable. \nThe survivors together-rotted themselves in the still habitable cities. \nTheir existence is determined by XEN, an organization, which took over the rule after the war. \n \nYou slip into the role of Selma Lombard, which lives in Ocean City. \nTo beginning of play you are in Selma's dwelling in Ocean City. \nThus you make on the way, without in the smallest ancestor who you are and which expects you.... \n \nCome healthy home again.","tags":[1,18,268435461,268435487],"videos":[{"id":33722,"video_id":"0BuXpdECqqU"}]},{"id":140099,"name":"Smugglers 3","platforms":[{"id":6,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}],"summary":"Play a greedy trader, an ambitious bounty hunter or a ruthless pirate and attack whole planets in this sci-fi trading game.
