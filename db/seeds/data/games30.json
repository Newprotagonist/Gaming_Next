Set in the year 1640, players assume the role of Anna, the Dark Angel of Retribution. Though he was defeated a century ago, the monsters and demons faithful to the Shadow Lord have begun preparations for his resurrection. Anna has exactly one year to prepare for the battle with this demonic entity, and in this time she must explore three distinct villages and six unique battlegrounds, slaying all the creatures she comes across. An action-RPG that borrows elements from the likes of Diablo, Dark Angel: Vampire Apocalypse presents players with a wide array of equipment and an arsenal of weapons -- both, projectile-based and melee-oriented -- to collect. \n \nWeapons are bound to the controller's four face buttons, allowing players to combine items as desired. The requisite meters allow you to monitor health, spirit, and experience levels as well as your current stash of gold. Spanning three separate races, the hordes of monsters all succumb to different weapons you have at your disposal. Broadswords for example, are particularly effective against the Undead. The storyline is purposely non-existent, with nothing in the way of cut-scenes, and minimal character interaction to reveal more of the plot. Players are free to do as the please with little in terms of specific objectives to complete. You simply have to build Anna's abilities for the duration of a year, and ensure that she will be strong enough when the time comes for her to face the Shadow Lord.","tags":[1,268435468,536871123,536871208,536871938]},{"id":196772,"cover":{"id":216567,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co4n3r.jpg"},"name":"Memory Puzzle: Bad Girl","platforms":[{"id":6,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}],"summary":"Train your brain with this memory game, revealing the naughty sexual adventures of a young bad girl, in images hidden behind pairs of cards which you have to match.","tags":[42,268435488,536872873,536874498]},{"id":44603,"cover":{"id":28829,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/bexkqrqkxlcpigtts6a1.jpg"},"name":"After Hours Athletes","platforms":[{"id":9,"name":"PlayStation 3"}],"screenshots":[{"id":114964,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/jl3ywvql1jpn7sg5vksb.jpg"},{"id":114965,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/ljkefjusa9ezlutzvg1f.jpg"},{"id":114966,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/fvzkvg20pbb6tosme4vn.jpg"},{"id":114967,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/fxuswxatiintyq2o7jla.jpg"},{"id":114968,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/ujtszsgq30drb4ksjdcl.jpg"}],"summary":"Released in Europe in 2011.","tags":[268435470]},{"id":29871,"cover":{"id":105462,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co29di.jpg"},"name":"４人打ちアクション麻雀 / ACTION MAHJONG","platforms":[{"id":6,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}],"screenshots":[{"id":202586,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/ubaseztcspadusefh7xx.jpg"},{"id":202587,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/hhnrw8apgulattqxs8la.jpg"},{"id":202588,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/ulmlnwuwi6rhemy7lk76.jpg"},{"id":202589,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/uocoiag9gwcju6okxrm2.jpg"},{"id":202590,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/tjdhkon3xsitoatnm7ck.jpg"}],"summary":"Don't draw the tiles you want!

This is the first fighting game featured within the series. The graphics seem to reflect other styles seen within the original Gundam Battle Assault, in which you will be playing right-to-left with advanced sprite graphics. Your spirit can also be regularly used within this fighter as to assist you. At random times in battle, the icon of your specific spirit will flash, in which if you press either O or X fast enough, your overall spirit meter will rise. When risen to the highest extent, you can unleash your ultimate. Within this game, three different buttons vary from a weak attack, or a more stronger attack. The combo system seems to range up to the max of 10 in battle. Story mode, Vs mode, and Arcade mode are the three playable modes within this game. In Story mode, you will experience various cutscenes and additional minigames. Arcade mode seems to be the same except for the fact that you will be continuously battling. Of course within Vs mode, you can battle against a friend or a com. Overall within this game, 17 characters are playable (3 of which being different versions of Yoh). It is known that Hao can also be playable, but a Gameshark code is needed. Fortunately, as well within battle, character voices will be experienced rather commonly, in which anime cutscenes will be experienced at times - such as in the intro.

After this, it's on to the third-person action levels, where you control Action Man from behind the back as he makes his way through enemy territory, and must occasionally solve puzzles to get out of whatever predicament he's found himself in this time. \n \nThe game's levels feature a myriad of locales, from evil villains' bases to the burning sands of the desert to the arctic chill of the North Pole. You'll face many of Action Man's most notorious fiends during the adventure.

Be warned, you only get one attempt at each temple and failure or settling for a lesser relic means you will never see that temple again...\n\nThe cleverest players will use the phantom runs of failed attempts from other players to their advantage and avoid the missteps and mistakes that led to their doom. Once the legendary relic at the bottom of each temple is found, the temple goes away forever and becomes the priceless trophy of the skilled adventurer.","tags":[1,21,268435487,268435488],"videos":[{"id":49540,"video_id":"MhsZ6mK-miI"},{"id":50636,"video_id":"yicglqHr9Kw"}]},{"id":84624,"cover":{"id":61980,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/bu3tjzzhckboxxyzsenm.jpg"},"name":"My Little Restaurant","platforms":[{"id":159,"name":"Nintendo DSi"}],"screenshots":[{"id":166556,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/p5wghhtiwbzk04gsnlad.jpg"},{"id":166557,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/pysjxjjj8iqmkhiqde6w.jpg"},{"id":166558,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/vbyzez2barizbe9qfcst.jpg"},{"id":166559,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/s2tzjubxflmhhegsefxp.jpg"},{"id":166560,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/fipmlnxl0lnefooced6h.jpg"},{"id":166561,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/add5eeficguaw07bpsra.jpg"},{"id":166562,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/znavanqybdhygnmdyend.jpg"},{"id":166563,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/ivwqxfbfokmkw26y1poj.jpg"},{"id":166564,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/y3cifymmlnconwtoah3t.jpg"}],"summary":"Welcome to My Little Restaurant.

As each turn of the battle starts, players decide which direction a Metal Walker will move and how hard they will move. Players are encouraged to form strategies that allow Metal Walkers to hit a single enemy, bounce off a wall, and then hit another enemy, all in a single turn. On the battlefield, players can throw several different types of items onto the field. The items are used when a Metal Walker hits them. Capsules and healing items strengthen and heal Metal Walkers, whereas attack items, such as Napalm, are only useful when the enemy hits them. There also exist Analyzers, which provide the player with Scan Data for any Metal Walker that is bounced into them. Scrap metal won after the battle can then be used with the Scan Data to create new Metal Walkers or purchase items. When an enemy is destroyed, the player's Metal Walker will gain experience points and an item might be obtained. If the player's Metal Walker runs out of Hit points, the player will lose half of the carried scraps and have to start from the last save point.\n\nOutside of battle, players explore a top-down overworld where they can explore various towns and dungeons. Most battles occur as random encounters. The overworld has several interactable elements, such as water, which the player needs a certain number of Cores to cross. The player can only carry one Metal Walker at a time and it will follow the main character on the overworld. By defeating the game's bosses, players earn Core Units, which allow Metal Walkers to evolve into new, stronger forms.","tags":[268435468,268435471,536871327,536871487,536871938,536877991]},{"id":40556,"aggregated_rating":70.0,"cover":{"id":183748,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co3xs4.jpg"},"name":"Greedy Guns","platforms":[{"id":3,"name":"Linux"},{"id":6,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"},{"id":14,"name":"Mac"}],"screenshots":[{"id":106748,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/cosko7mvw3o4gapk0ucg.jpg"},{"id":106749,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/l6q5mnddbspweiniqsfl.jpg"},{"id":106750,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/yzfyygibcml39vnhk4rm.jpg"},{"id":106751,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/cxelkzmwnwzzylxtmsnf.jpg"},{"id":106752,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/vqeuqo6bm0tklizrused.jpg"}],"summary":"Greedy Guns is a colorful, joyful, platformer that sprinkles elements of exploration on top of excruciating challenges.

With these winnings they can repair or upgrade various components of the hydroplane to improve racing performance and remain competitive in the increasingly-difficult races. Eliminator Boat Duel offers three difficulty levels: Easy, Normal, and Expert. Completing a race at a lower difficulty level advances the player to the next higher one. At each difficulty level, the player's hydroplane can be damaged from impact with animals, the opponent's hydroplane, and various stationary objects. A false start is penalized with a $2,000 fine. For most of a race, players control their hydroplanes from a bird's-eye view, and the screen scrolls in multiple directions; but in one segment of the race, the graphical perspective changes to a third-person tracking mode. In a single-player game, the player competes first with Seasick Sidney (in Easy mode), with Aquarius Rex (in Normal mode), or with Surfer Bob (in Expert mode).
