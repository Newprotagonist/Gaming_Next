It was released on December 25, 2002 for Japanese arcades, on October 9, 2003 for the Japanese PlayStation 2, and on September 21, 2004 for the North American PlayStation 2. This game is the ninth release in North America, but despite having the same name as its Japanese counterpart, its gameplay and soundtrack is significantly different[1] and won the Video Music Awards in 2005 on MTV for Best Video Game Soundtrack. \n  \nWhile the PlayStation 2 version came out in North America, the arcade version was exclusive to Japan. Despite this, the arcade version was exported to many arcades in the USA (most of them being bootlegged). Dance Dance Revolution Extreme was the last game in the DDR arcade franchise for four years until Dance Dance Revolution SuperNova in 2006. The arcade release of the game contains one of the largest soundtracks of any DDR game, featuring 240 songs, as well as music from other Bemani music titles. Konami issued an in-game thank you to the fans of Dance Dance Revolution and announced a rejuvenation of the entire series, but did not go into details. Konami\u0027s announcement led people to believe that DDR Extreme might be the final DDR release or that the series might be on hiatus or rebooted in the same manner as Beatmania and Beatmania IIDX.",

    "summary": "Roller Coaster Mania is a single player, mouse controlled game in which the player builds and rides roller coasters. \n \nNavigation through the game is mouse controlled and is greatly simplified. The main menu, for example has just three icons, build a roller coaster; ride a pre-made roller coaster; and exit to windows. The build screen is equally simple with three panels in which the player chooses one of the five locations, one of the three styles of coaster each of which has four styles of carriage . \n \nWhen building a coaster the player selects a track section from the menu and places it onto the active end of the build with the mouse. The game automatically adjusts the pieces of track available depending on the piece that was previously laid and the terrain. Sometimes the player will find that the game offers no track pieces at all, this is usually because the track is about to go through landscape, another section of track, or because the terrain makes it impossible to position the track supports.  \nOnce a circuit is complete a menu pops up with the options to save the track, test it and to ride it.",

Now three adventurers happen to meet by chance and discover the Demon Stone just as it breaks and releases the two spirits: a Githyanki general and a Slaad lord. Now only these three can prevent a war that will sweep over all Faerun. Forgotten Realms: Demon Stone is an action RPG set in the world of Dungeons \u0026 Dragons: Forgotten Realms. Take control of three heroes, Rannek the fighter, Illius the sorcerer, and Zhai the rogue, as they try to destroy the evil unleashed by the breaking of the Demon Stone. The player only controls one character at a time but can switch between them on the fly with the direction pad. Each character has his/her own attack and can perform combos by pressing certain button combinations, e.g. B + B or A + B + A, and even perform team attacks and a team super attack. As they gain experience they will gain levels and can purchase new moves (combos) or upgrade old ones with experience points. They also collect gold with which they purchase new weapons, armor, and accessories at the end of each chapter.",

It changed the turn-based combat of its predecessor to a unique \"tug of war\" style real-time combat system, where battles are a clash of energy between the party and the enemy, with the player needing to push the energy towards the enemy to strike them, while being able to use a shield to block or a suction ability to absorb the opponent\u0027s power. The game also improves upon the conversation system of its predecessor and more closely resembles the one in Digital Devil Story: Megami Tensei released around the same time.",

A first person desktop game filled with adventure, discovery and combat.\n\nBlue Horizon has been created so the player is in a large open world environment. With each part of the game although separate can be explored without the player noticing.\n\nCaribbean World\nThere is only one level. Always viewable on the horizon. Initially consisting of 8 Islands, the player must discover each location in order to explore it. Locations can be discovered by talking to NPCs (Non-Playable characters), or following maps found. Once a location has been found it can be traveled to and from using a ship.\n\nTropical Islands with towns, villages, forts, dunes, mountains, cave systems, giant caverns, ship wrecks, and forests all lay in wait for the player to find and explore.\n\nInventory and Items\nWeapons, equipment, books, valuable loot are found laying around, in containers or purchased from shops and peddlers, looted from enemies, or given as rewards for completing tasks previously given. Keys are required for some doors too.\nWeapons are currently melee, pistols and cannon emplacements.\n\nEquipment or a pistol can also be equipped in the left hand such as the Lantern for seeing in dark caves. Provisions are needed to restore health, enhancement items can also be found or purchased.\n\nTasks\nTo progress, one must complete tasks given from NPCs or from instructions found. The NPCs will be grateful, whether they are for the main quest or side missions. Tasks may involve collecting, farming, building, hunting, slaying or completing another task. Hidden stashes, and Bounty hunting are available from NPCs.\n\nEnemies\nThere are dangerous islands, and relatively safe islands. Unique foes await, be they Pirates, animals or strange creatures, undead and non-human. Some enemies are weak, some are strong and have various short and long range attacks. Some individuals you encounter will be docile until provoked, in which case they may attack as a group.\n\nEnemy ships can plague the player too. Captain Bloodbeard\u0027s ship is the main aggressor. Bosses await to complete the main story line. The seas contain Marauding Pirate ships which you may encounter when sailing from Island to Island.\nThe game is still in development and is being expanded to give the player the most enjoyment and fun as possible, while making it not too easy or too hard.",

The player controls Storm Jaxon who is able to run left and right, jump and swing Sküljagger\u0027s magic sword. Storm must reach the end of each level before time runs out or risk losing a life. Under normal circumstances, touching an enemy or projectile will cause him to die, though the sword is often able to destroy projectiles. By collecting red jewels, Storm is able to both augment the sword with a projectile attack and be protected from one enemy attack. Green jewels will also protect from one enemy attack, however collecting 25 of them will grant an extra life. Blue jewels add additional time for Storm to complete each level. Finding a mask will make Storm invulnerable for a short time. These power-ups are either floating in the air of each level or hidden away in chests, boxes, rocks and coconuts. However these items which may hide items can also be picked up and thrown at enemies.",

If you win, your choices get implemented. Lose, and your game and studio might head in a direction you did not sign up for.\n\nWork your way up from arcade-style games to full-fledged AAA releases. Once you start your journey as an Indie developer, move to new studio locations and hire the right people as you work your way up in the industry.

It was your dream, after all.\n\nDid we tell you how Game Development wasn\u0027t easy?\n\nFeatures\nProcedural rogue-lite progression.\nPersistent stress tolerance (health) between projects.

Like previous installments it picks off where the other Heat The Soul left off, the story picks up from the entry of Hueco Mundo to the encounter between Grimmjow and Ichigo. New features include a \"Tag Action\" system and a new way for releasing zanpakutō. Transformations such as Bankai are now made when 2 bars of reiatsu is obtained and then pressing the L button, rather than selecting a character\u0027s Bankai form before a fight. There also seems to be 3 styles of tag action: offensive, defensive and technical. There is also a game mode called Tag Master, which lets you choose 2 characters to fight with in a series of fights. The system also includes specials which use the tagged partner\u0027s abilities. \n \nThe game features 32 characters usable in Tag Battle mode, while extra characters can be obtained with Bleach: Heat The Soul 4 game save through game conversion. However, these characters are only usable in single mode with no in-game transformation. They are selected through a separate menu accessible by pressing L/R in the normal character menu."

The term \"real time\" means that everything in the game is happening instantaneously with no breaks in game play. Portions of both the 3-D overhead screen and the character screen are displayed at one time. This prevents the need to switch from one screen to another during game play. The full-screen map of the valley is displayed whenever you wish to go from one location in the valley to another. All of the important icons and character information are displayed on the top portion of the character screen. This allows you to have the top of the character screen visible, while your character moves on the 3-D overhead map.",

You then choose which stage you want to play. You will need to play the early stages in order to reveal the later stages. After you finish the stages in a chapter, you will be able to play a boss map to conclude a chapter. Then you are on to the next one. \n \nAlternatively, you can play the original story mode that will put you on a more difficult series of battles than the scatter story mode. \n \nThere is three modes that show the true ending of the game if completed. Core Mode is unlocked by finishing Rank mode (Scatter Mission Mode), Overworld Mode by finishing the extra missions and Core Mode, which contains the final battle of the main saga , and Hell Mode, the final mode of the game, and shows the truth about the story of the game and serves as the epilogue of the saga and therefore, the true ending. \n \nLike the other games in the series, your unit gain XP from destroying enemies and when they gain certain level, you can upgrade them to new units. \n \nMaster Pilots also returned to this game, this time they all have very powerful abilities that can really change the pace of the battles. \n \nAlthough this series has never been released in the West this game has a English patch available making this the only translated version of the series.",

By adding bullet-deflecting shields, removing the danger elements from the debris and placing another player in the scene, a frantic gameplay with plenty of possibilities for mastery emerged. The team has been working on HDM as a side project ever since, managing to land the game on the market in slightly more than a year.\n\nHDM is part of the ID@Xbox programme.",

With the help of your touch screen controlled water gun, you explore the house room by room, fighting off waves of enemies (assorted household objects) coming from every direction. You also pick up various power-ups along the way. You can play as each of the three characters from the film - DJ, Chowder, and Jenny. \n \nMonster House is an action-adventure game developed by Artificial Mind and Movement and published by THQ. Although the game was marketed toward the same pre-teen audience as the accompanying film, its gameplay was highly reminiscent of Resident Evil 4; the game was generally higher-quality than many other games based on children\u0027s films, and it received high ratings from numerous prominent gaming magazines and websites, including Play magazine and GameZone. \n \nMonster House was met with mixed reviews. Aggregating review websites GameRankings and Metacritic gave the Game Boy Advance version 66.50% and 69/100, the GameCube version 65.13% and 60/100, the DS version 63.65% and 62/100 and the PlayStation 2 version 60.64% and 59/100. \n \nThis game is heavily inspired by classics like Robotron and Smash TV.",

Ki and Gilgamesh must escape the Tower of Druaga, fighting through the legions of Druaga that are trying to avenge their fallen master.\n\nOne player controls Ki and the other controls Gilgamesh. Ki will instantly die if an enemy touches her but she has a ranged attack to keep opponents at bay, while Gilgamesh defeats any enemy he touches. However, Gilgamesh will die if he is forced to take on too many enemies on his own. The aim is to combine efforts to fight through enemies and explore each of the tower\u0027s rooms for valuable items.",

Also unlike the previous games, the plot takes place on multiple planets, instead of different environments in Helios. \n \nLike the original game, this game was released in two editions: Standard and Limited. The Standard Edition came with the disc, cover, and manual, while the Limited Edition came with an extra\u0027s disc detailing the making of the game and additional maps to download for multiplayer.",

    "summary": "The year is 2025 and the world is shaken by numerous conflicts over the control of dwindling natural resources. The hunger of rival warlords and dictators of mainly underdeveloped countries for advanced and highly effective weapon systems appears insatiable and the profits of the arms industry have reached new heights. \n \nAs highly advanced weapon systems, made in the USA, are sighted on various battlegrounds in Third World countries, the US government decides to send in an ISA agent, Cpt. Myra Lee, to find out how political enemies are acquiring arms that are under strict embargo. \n \nMyra is sent to Mogadishu, where American made weapons have allegedly been employed in combat by Somali military forces against rebel units. In Somalia, Myra meets Cpt. Aron Alvarez, a hard-boiled close combat specialist of US Army\u0027s 1st SFOD-Delta, whose squadron is assigned to assassinate Somalia’s dictator. Myra and Aron begin working together only to discover that that the seriousness of the whole affair reaches much deeper than just the illegal trade of US weapon systems. \n \nA special unit under the codename SHADOW HARVEST is formed within the ISA to reveal the truth. Cpt. Myra Lee and Cpt. Aron Alvarez are made partners in the operational core of this special unit and their investigations lead them to various places all over the world. \n \nBased on the operations of the Intelligence Support Activity (ISA), with missions ranging from gathering critical intelligence data to covert direct action operations. The existence of the ISA has never been officially confirmed by the US government.  \nTwo completely different characters; each with very specific and fully fleshed out sets of skills, preferences and abilities. Cooperatively complete covert operations. Players may switch between each character at any time, using either Aron\u0027s combat abilities or Myra\u0027s stealth skills to solve the situation. \n \nPlayers choose from a vast array of weapons and technologies that enhance both characters strengths. Employ mechanized weapons to boldly attack enemies from head-on or an invisibility shield to creep through enemy territory undetected. Take advantage of refined game mechanics that take the traditional shoot-to-kill approach to a new level.",

Garland takes damage from enemy attacks as well as the environment (hidden spikes, high temperature, etc.), but suffers no damage should he fall off a platform.\n\nThe hero uses his sword to combat the enemies, and shield to defend himself. He can also learn and cast projectile offensive magic. Special items can restore his health, increase the damage inflicted with the sword, grant additional protection, etc. Various types of clothes can be equipped; these can bestow the hero with further enhancements and immunities, such as prevent him from slipping on ice, allow him to jump higher, etc.\n\nThe Duke will visit different towns during his journey. In these towns, he can rest, replenishing his health, purchase and repair weapons and armor, acquire potions, and learn magic spells. Currency is obtained by exchanging enemy spirits for gold in banks. These spirits (called \"almas\") also serve as experience points: after the player has obtained a sufficient amount of them, the protagonist receives upgrades to his health and magic points from a local town sage.",

Everyone expected the league leaders to roll into town and easily defeat the home team. But the scrappy upstarts have played the game of their lives and managed to keep the score tied right until the end. Their fatigue is showing and now it\u0027s their last chance. If the home team batters don’t score a run now, the visitors will be sure to win the game in extra innings. It all comes down to the Bottom of the 9th!\n\nWill you lead the underdogs to victory? Or will you defend the league leaders’ unbroken winning streak?\n\nBottom of the 9th is a strategic 2-player baseball game played with cards and dice. This faithful adaptation brings the fast-paced fun of the tabletop game to your phone and tablet! Choose your lineup from a pool of players with different strengths and abilities, outsmart your opponent in the stare-down, then roll the dice to trigger the action.\n\nBottom of the 9th offers many ways to play:\n• Compete in single player against a computer opponent (3 levels of difficulty)\n• Take on the Manager\u0027s Challenge 6-game solo campaign mode\n• Pass and play on your device with a friend\n• Challenge a friend to play online\n• Find a worthy opponent in a ranked online match\n• Organize a casual online exhibition game\n\nThe powerhouse visitors have 6 dynamite pitchers to choose from, including:\n• Wake Louder throws a nasty knuckleball that can get a lost ball just into the edge of the strike zone.\n• Southpaw Straw is a talented lefty pitcher with one dangerously effective (and illegal) spitball.\n• Hurricane Patriss is a top notch reliever, and the only thing more hypnotic than his curveball is his voice.\n\nDon\u0027t count out the home team! They have a dozen batters, each with their own special powers, including:\n• Mully Nomah can be devastating against the pitching team when runners are in scoring position. He can clobber a pitch and get those base runners home!\n• Kerry Rumble has power behind her swing. She has the ability to crush the ball hard, at the cost of hitting lots of fouls. She just can’t resist taking a swing!\n• K.C. Petty is truly a powerhouse when the chips are down. The more strikes he gets, the bigger he swings.\n• Hannah Cait may look innocent, but when she\u0027s in the zone she calls all the shots! This rookie\u0027s level of control over her swing is the envy of many a veteran.\n\nBoth teams have access to 2 support characters who provide special abilities to one or both teams:\n• Dice Dixon has no problem taking chances coming out from the dugout, benching batters and challenging umps!\n• Doc Mullins is always looking after the health of the team, whether that means a more rested pitcher or more energized batters!\n\nThe Manager\u0027s Challenge solo campaign mode puts you right in the dugout as a team manager. Can you lead your team to the playoffs in a 6-game homestand?\n• Play 6 game solo campaigns as the home team against a revolving cast of pitchers.\n• Compete in 9 different game situations, including multiple inning games.\n• Each campaign game is played using one of 6 effect cards that change the feel of the game.\n\n~~~ There’s nothing that’s quite like the thrill you feel in the Bottom of the 9th! ~~~\n\nCompatible with Android devices with NEON CPU support. Older devices with Tegra 2 CPUs are not compatible. The recommended minimum amount of device RAM is 1 GB.\n\nBottom of the 9th is an officially licensed product of “Bottom of the 9th” from Greater Than Games and Dice Hate Me Games.\n\nFor more information, visit Bot9Digital.com",

If you fail to plan your attacks properly, my ships will rip you to shreds. \n \nImpact: I have knocked out your weapons and left you defenceless. But I enjoy toying with my prey so I have left your ship’s boosting abilities intact; you will need to rely on them. \n \nTwin-Gun: can you think and act at the same time, pilot?
