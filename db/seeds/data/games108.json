Battles take place in square grids, and each unit occupies 1 square. Units can belong to one of two sides: allies (controlled by the player) or enemies (controlled by the computer AI). Each unit can move up to a fixed amount of squares along the battlefield, determined by its Move statistic. Depending on its location relative to enemies and to allies, a unit also has the option to attack, cast a spell, use an item, search (if adjacent to a treasure chest), or stay and do nothing, all of which end the unit's turn.\n\nSome commands, such as equipping or dropping items, don't count as actions, and the character's turn is able to continue. The order of the turns is determined by the unit's agility score and a random seed. Units can use offensive actions, such as physical attacks or offensive magic, only on units belonging to the other side and can use supportive actions, such as healing magic, stat-enhancing magic, and items, only on units belonging to the same side.\n\nThis game (together with Shining Force: The Sword of Hajya) was later given a remake named Shining Force CD, released on the Sega CD.

As the game is on DS, the touch screen allows players to store an additional power-up and view the distance still to go in a level.","tags":[1,268435464,268435487,536870928,536871049,536871186,536871208,536871315,536871470,536871501,536871641,536871758,536871776,536871971,536872010,536872098,536872211,536872232,536872293,536872594,536872622,536872733,536872957,536872961,536873023,536873024,536873064,536873067,536873186,536873236,536873323,536873327,536873671,536873973,536874398,536874745,536875046,536875056,536875072,536875073,536875101,536875128,536875130,536875175,536875197,536875201,536875209,536875213,536875214,536875232,536875262,536875271,536875276,536875298,536875308,536875330,536875356,536875391,536875392,536875396,536875421,536875422,536875434,536875437,536875456,536875491,536875499,536875525,536875606,536875621,536875623,536875639,536875645,536875670,536875689,536875702,536875713,536875768,536875803,536875819,536875837,536875852,536875870,536875902,536875921,536875924,536875934,536875944,536876083,536876120,536876212,536876242,536876270,536876351,536876353,536876361,536876501,536876508,536876540,536876599,536876615,536876634,536876713,536876751,536876753,536876754,536876799,536876952,536877035,536877048,536877050,536877051,536877052,536877054,536877055,536877057,536877059,536877061,536877062,536877063,536877065,536877066,536877067,536877068,536877069,536877070,536877071,536877072,536877084,536877086,536877088,536877090,536877091,536877092,536877093,536877096,536877104,536877106,536877115,536877116,536877280,536877451,536877490,536877561,536877575,536877710,536877713,536877716,536877717,536877739,536877759,536877833,536877930,536878019,536878153,536878154,536878155,536878159,536878160,536878192,536878196,536878217,536878606,536879061,536879148,536879791,536879805,536880187,536880320,536880360,536880417,536880810,536881263,536882290,536882309,536882724,536882824,536882826,536882829,536883122,536883128,536883567,536884018,536884021,536884022,536884086,536884087,536885958,536886003,536886707,536900534],"videos":[{"id":34877,"video_id":"Zy41U69D6Lc"}]},{"id":183536,"cover":{"id":210256,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co4i8g.jpg"},"name":"Butterfly Collector","platforms":[{"id":6,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}],"screenshots":[{"id":694588,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scevy4.jpg"},{"id":694589,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scevy5.jpg"},{"id":694590,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scevy6.jpg"},{"id":694591,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scevy7.jpg"},{"id":694592,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scevy8.jpg"}],"summary":"Myst In The Bug Garden","tags":[19,268435465,268435487],"videos":[{"id":64635,"video_id":"3hdEYg7u9YA"}]},{"id":47410,"cover":{"id":61134,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/tfywllra8ux7wevqstr2.jpg"},"name":"Company of Heroes: Collector's Edition","platforms":[{"id":6,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}],"screenshots":[{"id":374385,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc80vl.jpg"},{"id":374386,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc80vm.jpg"},{"id":374387,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc80vn.jpg"}],"summary":"Company of Heroes takes you back to World War II, where you'll guide Able Company through the deadliest battles in WW2's European theatre, including the D-Day landings at Normandy.

Picking up two years after the events of the first game, the game sees series protagonist Prince Pietro tasked with retrieving a crown from a nearby cave as part of his rite of succession. But after finding the crown, he encounters a mysterious figure. Identifying himself as Baskal, the figure delivers a strange prophecy to Pietro, and asks the prince a question. \n \n\"What do you think the true treasure of kings is?\" \n \nWith this question begins a touching, romantic, and sometimes tragic journey that will reunite Pietro with familiar faces, introduce him to new companions, and forever change the boy prince of the Kingdom of PoPoLoCrois. \n \nA much beloved sequel that many fans remember as the high point of the series, PoPoLoCrois Monogatari II builds on the already beautiful pixel art graphics of the first game, with detailed, lovingly crafted environments and some outstanding sprite animation. Spread across three discs, the game also features full voice acting for its story sequences, which was a series first, and a relative rarity for RPGs of the era. \n \nThe battle system broadly resembles that of its prequel, with combat taking place directly within the game's environments, and movement and positioning playing a key role in battles. But certain features have been simplified and streamlined compared to the first game, and the level of difficulty is generally a lot lower. \n \nMany of the game's events were loosely adapted in the third chapter of the 2005 PSP title PoPoLoCrois. The opening segments also appear as part of the same title's second chapter.","tags":[17,268435468,536871433,536872522],"videos":[{"id":32970,"video_id":"w0wVuKVOnjo"},{"id":32971,"video_id":"T2UQ_s9a1EE"},{"id":32972,"video_id":"ph2s8HkmrEM"}]},{"id":77217,"cover":{"id":151643,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co390b.jpg"},"name":"Where in the World is Carmen Sandiego?: Deluxe Edition","platforms":[{"id":13,"name":"PC DOS"}],"screenshots":[{"id":487546,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scag6y.jpg"},{"id":487547,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scag6z.jpg"},{"id":487548,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scag70.jpg"}],"summary":"Rehash of Where in the World is Carmen Sandiego?, featuring high-resolution VGA graphics, digitized sound effects, and new locations.\n\nThe life cycle is self-explanatory: sign up for a case, travel between locations questioning witnesses, obtain warrants, and make arrests, and you have approximately a week to do so.

This anti-terrorist tank force was conceived after an ill-fated campaign at Mostvia Vatska in 1994. Coming under heavy fire, the troops sent a distress signal to the U.S. Intelligence requesting immediate backup. The government turned their backs on the Special Forces unit by making them expendable and refusing to send in backup. As a result, five men survived; those five men formed Da Wardenz.\n\nHere's where you come into play. Assuming the role of a rookie commando, your mission is simple: prove yourself to Da Wardenz by destroying terrorist forces and rectifying global corruption. Easy, huh? That's not all -- you'll be in command of an M-13 Predator battle tank; this thing can mow down forests and calm any terrorist dispute. Along the way, you can upgrade your tank in armaments and shielding.\n\nShellshock is broken into two parts: The Pen and actual mission objectives. As Da Wardenz headquarters, The Pen has all sorts of locations including the main hangar, basketball court, simulation room, workshop area, briefing area, and various lockers. Before a mission, you'll want to explore the headquarters and interact with each member of the team; you may learn something.

The expansion comprises an assortment of otherworldly planes that do not exist in a planetary sense within the EverQuest universe. \n \nThe expansion added content to the game aimed specifically toward the high-end player. In addition to adding new zones to the game, the expansion also introduced a network of portal points through the game realm. Players could use them to quickly travel to and from various regions through a central plane, known as Plane of Knowledge. \n \nThe primary goal, or end-quest, of The Planes of Power is access to the Plane of Time. Access to this plane can only be obtained through vanquishing the four elemental deities or avatars of such: Fennin Ro, The Rathe Council, Coirnav and Xegony. To gain access to all of the zones of the expansion and successfully enter the Plane of Time, the players needed to complete 28 flag events of all sorts, involving the death of planar deities and deific creatures. These encounters can only be completed with the organized effort of up to 72 players working together simultaneously. \n \nIn order to enter the expansion's basic zones, a player had to reach the former set planar level of 46. From there, one had to complete tasks to gain access to the more advanced zones. It was later changed so that once the character reached level 55 they gained access to two more zones which are the Plane of Valor and the Plane of Storms. At 62 the Bastion of Thunder then became available. Those level limits can be bypassed by completing the progression of the expansion, allowing for example to be level 46 while adventuring in the Bastion of Thunder. The maximum level was increased from 60 to 65 with this expansion and new Particle Weapons were added, when before only epic weapons had such visual effects.","tags":[17,268435468],"videos":[{"id":22695,"video_id":"WUGQrR4uGnk"}]},{"id":142702,"cover":{"id":204110,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co4dhq.jpg"},"name":"Gradiently","platforms":[{"id":130,"name":"Nintendo Switch"}],"screenshots":[{"id":419160,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc8zfc.jpg"},{"id":419161,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc8zfd.jpg"},{"id":419162,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc8zfe.jpg"},{"id":419163,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc8zff.jpg"},{"id":419164,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc8zfg.jpg"},{"id":419165,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc8zfh.jpg"}],"summary":"Gradiently - casual color puzzle game for everyone.

It comes from the days when we use to call them PSW's (Persistent State Worlds). Nowadays most MMO games are really just PSC (Persistent State Characters) where essentially its just your character that changes and is saved. In Project Visitor you build the world around you, you attack others and the lands they have built and the whole world is saved to the database. Also the world continues to grow and battles happen, lands are lost, gained, etc even while your offline. To maintain your land you have to be involved, join a protective group called a MDN, own, mine, defend, survive! \n \nPreviously known as 10Six, it was Sega's first foray into MMO's, a persistent online RTS where players signed up for one of four mega-corporations aiming to conquer the rogue planet Visitor, which has entered the solar system and contains a treasure of valuable resources. \n \nPlayers construct and capture mining sites, construct defenses and NPC units to help defend and attack in a fairly traditional RTS mode, but much of the game also consists of player on player combat in first or third person modes, similar to Battlezone or Planetside. \n \nThe server infrastructure was designed to be able to handle a million simultaneous players and was hosted through SegaSoft's Heat.net, but never saw player counts that high. After failing to attract a sufficiently large audience Sega shut down the game in June 2002, offering refunds to anybody with subscription time left. \n \nA community effort to relaunch the game was started soon after the servers were taken down. Conundrum Studios was formed in late 2002, and the game was relaunched under the name Project Visitor in 2003.","videos":[{"id":47610,"video_id":"EC4waS1po6c"},{"id":47611,"video_id":"TI8sR34jwr4"}]},{"id":140530,"cover":{"id":118687,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co2jkv.jpg"},"name":"Brew & Brawl: Gnomes vs. Dwarves","platforms":[{"id":6,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}],"screenshots":[{"id":406186,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc8pey.jpg"},{"id":406187,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc8pez.jpg"}],"summary":"Brew & Brawl: Gnomes vs. Dwarves is a local couch party game that combines MOBA elements with the gameplay from a fast-paced brawler.","tags":[1,17,40,268435460,268435488,536871850,536871884,536872386,536872485,536872978,536877593,536897490],"videos":[{"id":42272,"video_id":"3IlBOn8koGE"}]},{"id":33217,"name":"World Of Undead","platforms":[{"id":6,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}],"screenshots":[{"id":57944,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/p3zljpqttfkrfgjz8dw8.jpg"},{"id":57945,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/wjshmdiarutucwsxqxiw.jpg"},{"id":57946,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/bu3zsfe4evsvvx2egmv8.jpg"},{"id":57947,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/mx7wi8f73pxmzhpeowjb.jpg"},{"id":57948,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/t1fipqkw7bmhx5duflfg.jpg"}],"summary":"Fast and Action packed First Person Shooter with Tower Defense Game Mechanics\nPlay the Campaign cooperative with up to four friends or check out our new and exciting asymmetrical Game Mode \"Attack and Defense\"","tags":[1,268435471,268435488]},{"id":46270,"cover":{"id":118293,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co2j9x.jpg"},"name":"Super Battleship","platforms":[{"id":19,"name":"Super Nintendo Entertainment System (SNES)"},{"id":29,"name":"Sega Mega Drive/Genesis"}],"screenshots":[{"id":117497,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/toc5zj8gzosfbid5xpyp.jpg"}],"summary":"Super Battleship is a video game based off of the board game of the same name.

Contestants would compete against each other in a triathlon of the NES titles Super Mario Bros, Rad Racer, and Tetris. The ROMs themselves were modified to suit the competition, and the winners would be determined by an overall score count from all three games. High placing winners took home a cash prize amongst other goodies. However, the finalists of this competition each took home their own copy of the specially made ROM on a standard NES cartridge. Another issue of the cartridge, colored in a golden tint similar to The Legend of Zelda cartridge, was even more elusive and was only distributed as a prize giveaway in Nintendo Power Magazine. Today, these two cartridge variations are some of the most elusive and sought after video games in history and are often considered a holy grail of video game collecting. As of recent years, only 116 gray cartridges and 26 golden cartridges are known to have ever been printed. Nintendo would later follow-up the legacy of this event with Nintendo World Championships returning in 2015 and 2017 showcasing old and new Nintendo games alike.

During the game, players spread their influence across Westeros through a combination of strategic planning, masterful diplomacy, and military might.

Martin, A Game of Thrones: The Board Game – Digital Edition allows up to six players to play online, or a single player with up to five AI opponents to play locally. The game is set after the death of King Robert Baratheon and allows each player to assume the role of one of the Great Houses of the Seven Kingdoms in an attempt to assault King’s Landing and claim the Iron Throne.\n\nTo be declared ruler of the Seven Kingdoms, you have 10 rounds to use diplomacy and warfare to your advantage to control as many strategic areas of the map.\nConquer with care as your resources are scarce and your troops are not expendable. Muster your army, plan your orders wisely and seize strategical lands with your Footmen, Knights, Siege Engine and ships.\nDuring the turmoil of a battle, use well-known characters from your house to take the upper hand and vanquish your enemies.","tags":[17,268435471,268435491,536872273,536890224],"videos":[{"id":41344,"video_id":"iiFer-BSePw"}]},{"id":20335,"aggregated_rating":80.0,"cover":{"id":16214,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/log5yr7e0ngsqekbotxi.jpg"},"name":"Super Sartdust Delta","platforms":[{"id":46,"name":"PlayStation Vita"}],"screenshots":[{"id":27230,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/zelxgmv8msoxa6pjfpwc.jpg"},{"id":27231,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/z7wq2nd9bk1o5shlx5i6.jpg"},{"id":27232,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/ajdijaf6u9hzavxj5sbc.jpg"},{"id":27233,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/v6wvqrtey5gkv5pln1gm.jpg"}],"summary":"A radical evolution of the top-selling, award-winning SSD HD for PS3, Super Stardust Delta takes you on a breathtaking tour of a new galaxy filled with jaw-dropping sights and sounds.\n\nUsing Playstation Vita’s unique controls and capabilities, you’ll unleash spectacular sci-fi weaponry on your enemies.

To do so, he places a single stone on the playfield. However, each stone also has a value between one and four which needs to be matched. Every time a stone is placed besides another stone, the value of the stone already on the field rises by one. If the value was already four, it resets to one. \n \nIn the second game, a pre-defined stone combination has to be erased. To do so, the player clicks on a stone which then disappears. But the stones around the clicked stone (left, right, above and below) also disappear.
