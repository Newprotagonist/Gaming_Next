The destruction of the Yuke Crystal during the Great War, with the Yuke Tribe suffering apparent annihilation, had at last brought the victorious Lilties dominion over the world as they bring it into a new age of science and reason through machines called \"crystal reactors,\" with the use of magic outlawed and rule over the Clavats and few Selkies who comply to the new order. In this new era of imbalance exists a rare breed of powerful beings called \"crystal bearers\", whose seemingly magical abilities have led them to be feared and scorned by the public.",

Boasting graphics that eclipse those of most handheld adventures, THE MUMMY RETURNS delivers all of the action and excitement from the film to the palm of your hand. You trek through countless Egyptian locales, battling spirits of the underworld, rats, pygmy mummies, scarabs, and much more.

    "summary": "Mario Power Tennis features variations of tennis matches consisting of characters, courts, and scenarios based on the Mario series. The range of courts includes the standard three types of tennis court, but consists predominantly of those themed upon games in the Mario series, known as \"Gimmick\" courts. As well as adopting the style aesthetically, these feature thematic elements that influence how the match will be played on that surface, such as the ghosts in the Luigi\u0027s Mansion court, which hinder movement when the character comes into physical contact with them.\nAlthough standard tennis is available, variants of the sport can be played which adopt different rules and methods of victory. \"Ring Shot\" involves the player earning points by hitting the ball through rings of varying sizes, with the number of points dependent on the difficulty of the shot.[9] The player acquires the points whenever a winning shot is made adhering to standard rules; the match is won once the predetermined number of points is equaled or surpassed. A similar mode, \"Item Battle\", involves the characters using items based on the Mario universe to interfere with each other\u0027s game and gain an advantage",

Between newfound enemies and domestic obstacles, the tiny mouse is having one heck of a time! There are eight gigantic levels to conquer in The Journey Home, and each one is based on a scene from the box office smash STUART LITTLE movies (which are, of course, based on the book by E.B. White). You\u0027ll end up tackling a mini-golf course, Central Park, a model boat race, a bunch of toy cowboys, and more in this epic quest for peace.

The MS-DOS version featured a track editor.\nA selling point for the Sega Genesis/Mega Drive version was the J-Cart, a cartridge including two control ports, thus eliminating the need for a 4-player adaptor.

An evil wizard named Darsul has cursed the three adventurers, causing their souls to become entangled as one. Only by exploring an ancient and mysterious land will they be able to free themselves. \n \nUnlike the first title, where players switched back and forth between two different adventurers, this incarnation follows all three characters. While only one character can be controlled at any given time, all share the same life bar referred to as a Soul Gage. Each character also has distinct physical and magical attacks to use on enemies. \n \nGathering items and weapons plays an integral role in character development, as the leveling-up system found in traditional RPGs has been eliminated. Instead, a character\u0027s attributes are influenced by his or her equipment. Not only do changes made to an outfit alter ability in battle, but they affect the way other characters perceive players as well. \n \nDepending on how NPCs perceive them, players may receive cheaper items or be given information they would not otherwise be privy to. A character\u0027s weapons, clothes, and items are shown in real time, thus any changes made will instantly alter his or her outward appearance.",

Solid gameplay will earn you the right to play as one of three locked characters, and each brawler is characterized by a unique (and highly comical) fighting style. The mostly non-violent fighting closely mirrors the humor of the film, resulting in some truly memorable melees. Using animations that are straight from the film, the game delivers the look and feel that made SHREK so successful.

    "summary": "Until Dawn is an interactive drama survival horror video game. It was originally scheduled to be released on the PlayStation 3 and feature PlayStation Move support, but in August 2014, the game was reintroduced as a PlayStation 4 exclusive.\n\nUntil Dawn is designed to be played multiple times, as players will miss out on quite a bit of content with a single playthrough. Each will last about nine hours in length and the game mechanics utilize a new in-game system called the \"Butterfly Effect\" in which any choice of action by the player may cause unforeseen consequences later on. For example, locating a weapon in an earlier chapter may allow the player to pick it up down the line when a chase scene leads back to the same room. Throughout the game, players will make difficult decisions during ethical or moral dilemmas, such as sacrificing one character to save another. The Butterfly Effect system blurs the line between right and wrong decisions and it is possible for players to keep all eight characters alive as well as having all eight of them die, allowing for many different paths and scenarios as well as offering several different endings. Until Dawn has a strict auto-save system to prevent players from reloading a previous save file to an earlier point in the game if they regret an in-game decision they have made. The only way to change the player\u0027s choice is to restart the game from the beginning or continue to the end and start a new game. In a developer interview, it has been said that Until Dawn has \"hundreds of endings\". Different endings have different variations depending on the combination of characters alive at the end of the game.\n\nThe gameplay is focused on exploration, quick-time events and discovering clues as well as making decisions. There is an in-game system that will keep track of all of the clues and secrets players have discovered in total, even if there are multiple playthroughs; these clues will allow the player to piece together the mysteries of Blackwood. In terms of the gameplay mechanics and theme, Until Dawn has been noted to be similar to Heavy Rain and Beyond: Two Souls.\n\nUntil Dawn was met with a positive critical response upon release, with praise directed at the visuals, choice mechanic, horror elements, music, voice acting and gameplay design. Most of the criticism the game drew was concerning the story, mostly the second half, camera angles, character movements and partially linear plot.",

    "summary": "Call of Duty 2: Big Red One is a first-person shooter that has a single-player story mode and a multiplayer mode. The player takes on the role of a soldier protagonist in specific missions during World War II from the perspective of the American 1st Infantry Division. The player can crouch and lie prone, and is able to scale low walls and other obstacles. Two firearms can be carried, which can be swapped with those left on the battlefield, and both fragmentation and smoke grenades can also be carried. A gun\u0027s iron sights can be used to aim more accurately. A compass on the heads-up display (HUD) shows both allies and enemies, and objective markers to indicate locations the player must reach, areas to defend, or enemy cannons or tanks that the player must plant explosives on to disable.\n\nEmplaced weapons such as machine guns and flak cannons are available in some locations to take out enemy forces. In addition, some missions place the player in control of a tank. It is also important for scouting, though most of the game takes place in personal, close combat situations reducing the importance of this tactic.",

It’s a platformer that has your character jumping, punching and cursing every time he scrapes his knee.\n\nOn the fence between being amusing and downright inappropriate\n\nFrom a graphics standpoint, AVGN: Game Over can’t be argued with because it is a fan-made game that aims to be anything but serious, but seriously offensive. It uses a retro look with old’school gameplay that work well together and with the rest of the game concept.\n\nIn every level you’ll be punching goombas, Kirbys and a whole lot of characters from popular platformers and not only. In the standalone games, some of the future punching bags are evil characters, others are heroes but in AVGN: Game Over they are all categorically victims.\n\nThe game pushes forward a sense of useless violence that is backed up by a good deal of verbal abuse that just isn’t right. At times cursing a bit can be funny but I’m not sure that this game has that thought in mind.\nDrop the F bomb, literally\n\nThe game is meant to reflect The Angry Video Game Nerd who has made a name for himself for openly bashing games that he considered to be bad. Presentation was everything and that’s also obvious in the game. There is a lot of cursing and to recharge his life essence, he drinks beer just like in real life.\n\nAs a game, AVGN: Game Over is...something. Having repetitive gameplay is an understatement because you can finish the game just by using a single move and the constant ‘F***’ shouts get annoying after a while.\nIf you’re the kind who easily gets frustrated, don’t play this\n\nTo wrap it up, AVGN: Game Over is not something worth recommending. As a game, it’s barely decent and its ‘charm’ solely revolves around the use of trash-talk and downright indecent language.",

Just like the Kessen and Musou series from Koei, certain liberties are taken from the original history. For example, unlike what happened in real life, it is possible to save Joan of Arc from being burned at the stake. A expansion remake, entitled Bladestorm: Nightmare was released for consoles in Japan at the end of January, 2015 and in western regions a couple months later. The worldwide Microsoft Windows release was on May 29, 2015.[",

The players first controls a prehistoric sea organism, and fights to gain evolution points with which he can improve his fish\u0027s body parts and upgrade his attack/defense abilities. The gameplay is not completely linear, which means that certain choices of paths and stages will affect the player\u0027s success. The game is composed of a series of stages, in which the sea organism slowly evolves into an amphibian, and later a land-only creature. The physical changes are fairly scientifically accurate which gives the game a semi-educational purpose as well.",

In the Screencheat arena, fast reaction times aren’t enough to keep you alive. When everyone is invisible, players will have to master the art of taking a not-so sneaky look at their opponent’s screens and working out where they are based on uniquely coloured areas of the map and distinctive landmarks.\n\nScreencheat pays homage to iconic competitive first-person shooters such as Goldeneye, Perfect Dark and Halo, by blending the elements everyone loves about those games and shaking it up with its own unique take on the genre. When everyone’s used to playing by the rules, can you adapt to unconventional gaming quick enough to get the upper hand?",

    "summary": "Dynamite Headdy is a platform game in which the player controls Headdy, a puppet with a detachable head. This head can be fired in eight directions to attack enemies and obstacles, as well as retrieve out of reach items. By grabbing a HangMan, Headdy is able to pull himself up various platforms, or drag certain areas towards him. By finding a walking case named HeadCase, Headdy can gain a special head type depending on the image shown on HeadCase at the time he hits it. These range from offensive heads that increase his strength, allows him to shoot homing stars or suck up everything on screen, to support heads which include invulnerability, shrinking to reach small areas and sleeping to regain health. Most of these heads have a time limit before the head returns to normal, with the player able to cancel at any time, though some heads, such as the Pin Head, disable manual cancellation. The game also features a side-scrolling shooter stage, during which Headdy can change between three unique Head Types.",

It has a simple story line where the hero needs to save Albion from the evil Lord Lucian by collecting together the other three heroes to defeat him. Interactive cut-scenes are a large part of the game however the main character never speaks and all dialogue is uncontrolled.\nThe game features a large variety of game play and freedom, allowing a player to shape the world around and the characters appearance and moral standing based on decisions throughout the game. The player can also get married both same and opposite sex and bring up children to childhood but no farther, expressions are a lot more interactive with NPC\u0027s than before",

They set up a base on Io, one of the moons of Jupiter, with a solid detachment of space marines for protection. The marines do their job well: when the first experimental gateway is opened they annihilate the forces of Hell. Anything that came through the gateway was immediately destroyed by the marines, and so research on the gateways continued.\n\nLater, the yearly supply ship came earlier than expected, and looks strange and unusually large on the radar. The personnel of the base go out to behold the terrible truth: it is a spaceship from Hell, built of steel, stone, flesh, bone and corruption. The ship\u0027s enormous gates open to unleash a rain of demons on the base. Quickly, the whole base is overrun, and everyone is slain or zombified.\n\nThe Doomguy, now in command of the marine deployment, has been away on a walk, and has thus escaped death or zombification. After being attacked by an imp he rushes back to the base, where he sees the demonic spaceship still hovering above it and realizes what has happened. Then he swears that he will seek vengeance for his slain troops, and sets out to kill as many evil creatures as possible.\n\nIn the end, the marine defeats the Demon-Spitter, and the game describes Something rumbles in the distance. A blue light begins to glow inside the ruined skull of the Demon-Spitter.",

The game, endorsed by Kevin Keegan, lets you take over the manager\u0027s reins of a soccer club in any of the English Leagues, be it the Premier League or the low lights of the Third Division. But this is no ordinary football game. Unlike others on the N64, PM is a management simulation, and you never actually take control of a match by controlling individual players. Instead, you pick the lineup, your own formation and the tactics of how the team should play. Then you let your players go off and do the work on their own. This makes the whole game harder since you never have direct control over the actions of the players -- instead, you have to hope that you picked the right combination of players and the right tactics to do the job.

It doesn\u0027t look likely, with conflict on a global scale flaring up again for the increasingly weary Green Army, as they fight to keep liberty and justice alive by pushing back the nefarious pursuits of the Tan Army and it\u0027s wicked leaders. Hot on the heels of the first war comes this new battle, one that will take our faithful green soldiers into battle on land, sea, air, and even deep underground to rat out the Tan forces. The ultimate mission: seek and destroy the secret Tan weapons factory and perhaps put an end to this struggle for once and for all. \n \nArmy Men: World War - Final Front is another chapter in the popular Army Men series from 3DO, and the sequel to Army Men: World War - Land Sea and Air. It once again places the players in control of a Green Army soldier dedicated to the mission of eradicating the Tan forces from every corner of the globe. Players will guide the soldier via a third-person, behind-the-back perspective, marching him boldly forward to take on the enemy onslaught. \n \nThe single-player game takes players through five different campaign, each set in a different global location and each with their own specific objectives. The soldier has a host of weapons to fight off the enemy soldiers and vehicles, armaments ranging from rifles and bazookas to flame throwers. He\u0027ll also be able to procure vehicles himself. Players will pilot tanks, jeeps, cargo trucks, motorcycles, and submarines in their quest to destroy the enemy supply and weapon lines. \n \nIn Multiplayer mode, two players are able to compete in head-to-head action or team up against the computer. Capture the Flag is included, is Grudge Match, which simply lets them blow each other up until only one is left standing. There is also a mode called Steal the Bacon, which is reminiscent of Kill the Man with the Ball, only instead of a ball, you\u0027ve got to keep your hands on the bacon while your enemies hunt you down.",

There he witnesses the plight of the lower classes – the victims of a tyrannical ruling elite whose only thought is for the preservation of their own lofty status. With civil war brewing, Magnus is faced with a terrible choice: to betray his own noble origins in the name of liberty, or turn a blind eye to the evils of his rotten society.\"",

    "summary": "Valkyria Chronicles is a tactical role-playing game developed and published by Sega for the PlayStation 3 in 2008. A Microsoft Windows version was released on November 11, 2014. A remastered version for PlayStation 4 was released in Japan on February 10, 2016 with a Western release planned for May 2016. Both PC and PS4 versions include previously released DLC.\n\nThe game is set in fictional Europa, loosely based on Europe during the early years of World War II. Because of its abundance of Ragnite ore, which takes the place of petroleum in the game setting, the neutral nation of Gallia comes under attack from the East Europan Imperial Alliance, which is itself engaged in war with the Atlantic Federation. Players take control of a unit of the Gallian Militia, dedicated to repelling the invasion. The game\u0027s visuals, which use Sega\u0027s CANVAS graphics engine, resemble pencil drawn paintings in motion.",

During each bout, players build an energy bar based on the number of successful kicks and punches they land on their opponent. As the bar fills, players can then morph their combatant into terrifying manimals from beasts such as lions and tigers to moles. The morph, in turn, unlocks a secondary control system specifically designed with each creature\u0027s combat moves and appearance in mind. In effect, this offers players two distinct combat types within one game.",

Journeying through five 3D levels, the characters must collect treestars while avoiding perilous pitfalls. \n \nLevels contain interactive elements, such as plants and tar bubbles. Depending upon the selected character, players can make use of tail whipping, head butting, and other abilities to build bridges, ride geysers, and overcome other obstacles. Petrie is also readily available to fly onscreen and offer advice and direction. Levels are composed of obstacle courses and puzzle-type action as players need to cross rivers, feed plants, and collect treestars while avoiding hazards, such as lava, water, and steep cliffs. After all five characters exit the fifth level, they are all reunited in the Great Valley.",

During the game, you will encounter obstacles like locks and vines. Locks prevent the gem from moving and are cleared by making a match with the trapped gem or using a bonus item. Vines do not stop the gems from moving but must be cleared before you can clear the bricks."

The game also saw the introduction of the \"Crazy Hop\" feature, which allows the player to jump over certain surfaces to save time, as they taxi passengers around the locations. By performing moves such as the \"Crazy Hop\" and the \"Crazy Dash\", the driver accumulates tips from their passengers, which increases the total score.\n\nThis sequel includes a modified soundtrack with rock bands The Offspring and Methods of Mayhem. The game also has some online modes in the form of a scoreboard, and replay-sharing.",

The 2004 update includes all the latest changes to the teams, up-to-date driver rosters, and also the new Bahrain and China circuits. Online multiplayer is introduced and the singleplayer mode has been extended with time attack races against ghost cars, and historic cars that can be unlocked upon completing a full championship.\n\nThe career mode is another new addition. You start at the back of the grid and you have to impress sponsors and manager to earn a spot on a team. Success leads to lucrative deals, while failure gets you fired. There are four difficulty levels and gamers can race as themselves, with their name lined up on the starting grid.",

As implied by the game\u0027s title, the game features a 1980s theme, consisting of songs from the decade and playable characters, fashions, and artwork that reflect the time period.\n\nThe game was not as well-received as the prior two Guitar Hero games, due to the lack of new gameplay features and reduced soundtrack. Rocks the 80s is the third and final title in the Guitar Hero series to be developed by Harmonix before they moved on to create Rock Band.[5] The next major installment of the series, Guitar Hero III: Legends of Rock, was developed by Activision\u0027s Neversoft division.[6]",

Players will take part in The Russian trophy, Off-Road Trial, Thai Trophy and many other events through the worst driving conditions with a variety of natural obstacles like swamps, rocks, snow and sand. \n \nNo other game features this variety of off-road sport vehicles including tuned stock SUVs and trucks, as well as several classes of prototypes specifically built for off-road driving. The vehicles can be equipped with an assortment of special cross-country equipment and accessories including winches, low gear, differential gear locking, clinometer, altimeter, tire air pressure control, sand tracks, etc. \n \nThere has never been such an innovative simulation of interactive terrain response as well. Terrain under the vehicle will act just like it does in real life, the car will sink in dirt, the dirt will create a rut and will stick to the car and tires affecting its handling. Stones will fly from underneath the wheels and damage other trucks. The game will feature various surfaces that will not only affect tire friction but have complex reactions based on car weight, speed, wheel torque, tire condition, time on this surface, depth of car immersion into the surface and much more.",

They each have different abilities, and, depending on the platform, you either can or can\u0027t decide when to switch characters. Another difference is that Quidditch is no longer playable, with flights on Buckbeak replacing it for the requisite flying mechanic.

In this game the player will be able to control the four main Savers characters, Marcus Damon, Thomas H. Norstein, Yoshino \"Yoshi\" Fujieda, and Keenan Crier along with their respective Digimon partners. The graphics for this game are cel-shaded and the battle system is similar to the Battle Terminal (a Japanese-only arcade game). The game is classified as a \"special genre\", called a \"Dramatic/Innovative RPG\", which means that the Digimon partners are affected by how you, the player, treat them. The way your Digimon evolves will be similar to Digimon World; the Digimon will be affected by how you take care of it and, depending on that, will digivolve into different types of Digimon. In Digimon World Data Squad, a new type of digivolution method is used, called the Galactica Evolution System: this will determine what Digimon your partner will evolve into. There will also be new, original characters for this game, meaning that these characters are exclusive to Digimon World Data Squad, and will not appear in any other Digimon Data Squad media."

You\u0027ll speed through six of Japan\u0027s most grueling circuits, blowing past the competition and taking the checkered flag. If the real deal doesn\u0027t do it for you, use the game\u0027s built-in Track Editor to put together a course that will meet your standards. The All Japan Grand Touring Circuit takes center stage in this detailed extravaganza, as 22 of the Circuits best drivers are the stars here. The vehicles can all be tweaked and upgraded allowing you to truly control your performance and style. Several modes of play make for high replay value and a huge fun factor, while the 32-bit graphics are good enough to pass for those of a home platform game. It\u0027s not every day that you get the chance to challenge the world\u0027s best GT racers, so you\u0027d better come with your wits sharpened and your seatbelt on.",

Mouse has to stop the villain and, most importantly, recruit other people to help him break the spell. \n \nEphemeral Fantasia is a Japanese-style role-playing game with turn-based combat.

The game\u0027s stand-out feature is the time-looping system, which is somewhat similar to the one implemented in The Legend of Zelda: Majora\u0027s Mask.

    "summary": "In the first Uncharted Waters game, it was the 15th century and the New World was discovered. Now in New Horizons, it is the early 16th century and the age of exploration and sea trade is underway. Players choose from any one of six adventurers (scenarios), each with their own distinctive but intertwining plot, to embark on a quest of sailing, seamanship and exploration. The six characters are:Joao Franco is the son of Duke Leon Franco, the hero of the first Uncharted Waters game and an influential man in Portugal. His father wants to make him into a strong man and so decides to send him out to sea. Young Joao is tasked with learning the skills of the sailor (he is the only character who starts at level one) and embarking on a quest of discovery; reaching the far east and eventually looking for the secret of Atlantis.\n\nCatalina Erantzo is a Spanish naval officer who believes her beloved and her brother were both murdered by the Portuguese armada. Vowing revenge she turns to a life of piracy and soon becomes a red haired scourge of the seas.\n\nPietro Conti is a indebted man, having inherited the financial woes of the Conti family. When the Duchess Franco hires him to spy on her son, he accepts the job and obtains a ship. Pietro hopes to use these resources to seek out valuable treasure and clear up his family\u0027s debt.\n\nErnst Von Bohr is a geographer who is teaching classes in Holland. But he yearns to leave the classroom and sail the high seas, living a life of adventure that he has only read about in books. When his friend, Mercator offers to finance his initial voyage in exchange for cartography information about the world, Ernst is given the opportunity to live out his dream.\n\nAli Vezas is a poor orphaned child living in Istanbul and serving others. He dreams of becoming his own master and making his own fortune across foreign lands. A twist of fate aides in providing him with small loans, with which he is able to afford his first ship and sail out with a cargo hold full of goods...\n\nOtto Baynes styles himself a Royal Knight of the British Empire, in the service of his majesty the king. Promoted to Admiral of the British fleet, the kingdom is worried about the increased naval power of Spanish fleets. Otto is given a letter of marque by the king and ordered to terrorize the Spanish Fleet. Equipping himself simply at first, Otto strives to become a great Privateer in the name of King and Country.Regardless of the character chosen, Uncharted Waters: New Horizons is a top-down sailing simulation. At sea, players control the direction of their ship, where speed is affected by the number/health of the crew, the wind and the currents. Players can navigate anywhere there is water (though some ships are not ocean worthy) and discover interesting landmarks and new ports. Upon landing at a port, the view is also top-down and the player can enter different buildings, each with unique services and goods. These include: The Inn, the Item Shop, The Shipyard, The Tavern, The Castle, The Guild Hall, The Church, The Merchant and the Harbor. It\u0027s up to the player to earn enough gold to keep the crew fed and financed and keep the fleet repaired. Primary methods of earning money are through sea trade, accepting jobs from the guild, gambling and battle with other ships.\n\nDuring naval combat, the game becomes a turn-based top-down strategy game, with the player moving ships in order to obtain trajectories needed to fire cannons at enemy ships, or run alongside enemy vessels in order to board them. If the player\u0027s flagship attacks the flagship of the enemy fleet, they can challenge the opponent to a duel. If accepted, the game changes to a side-view of the two captains engaged in a fight. During this sequence, the player can only choose which fighting maneuver (strike, thrust, parry, lash) they wish to engage in.",

    "summary": "MGS: Peace Walker is an action-adventure stealth video game and is the third action-based Metal Gear title made specifically for the PSP, following Metal Gear Solid: Portable Ops and its stand-alone expansion Portable Ops Plus, and the first in the series released for a portable platform to be directed by series\u0027 creator Hideo Kojima. This is the first title in the series to alter the traditional tagline \"Tactical Espionage Action\" to \"Tactical Espionage Operations\", referring to the base building and mission mechanics of the game. \n \nSet in 1974 in Costa Rica, the game follows the exploits of returning protagonist Big Boss (previously known as Naked Snake in Snake Eater and Portable Ops, now known simply as Snake) as he runs the mercenary unit Militaires Sans Frontières (Soldiers Without Borders). \n \nPeace Walker consists of two primary playing modes: \"Mission\" and \"Mother Base\". \"Mission\" are the actual action sequences of the game, where the player must infiltrate an enemy territory, whereas \"Mother Base\" is a crew managing simulation mode similar to the \"Comrade System\" in Portable Ops. \n \nMissions \nPlayers get to choose which missions to play from the \"Mission Selector\" screen. There are two main types of Missions: Main Ops are the primary story-based missions in which goals are determined by the narrative and must be played in a strict order in order to proceed. Some Main Ops missions include illustrated cutscenes that involve bits of interactivity in order to proceed. Extra Ops are optional side-missions that involve much more elaborate goals ranging from simple target practices to obtaining secret documents. \n \nWhen the player completes a mission, his or her performance is evaluated afterward. A player\u0027s score is penalized with a lower rank and reduced heroism for excessive killing and frequently being discovered, whereas players who are stealthy and subdue enemy soldiers non-lethally will be awarded appropriately. Players can replay previously cleared missions for higher ranks. \n \nPlayers can go through missions as Snake or as an MSF soldier (male or female). Some missions will only be available to Snake, and likewise for MSF soldiers. \n \nThe game adopts certain mechanics from Metal Gear Solid 4, such as the ability to move while crouched, the over-the-shoulder shooting view, the CQC system, and the ability to search held-up soldiers. The truck from Portable Ops, where players can bring subdued enemies for recruitment, has been discarded in favor of the Fulton Recovery System, which players attach to subdued soldiers and prisoners. The Wi-Fi recruitment system from Portable Ops has been modified so that instead of tapping the Circle button to obtain a strong enough signal from an access point, the player will have to knockout soldiers using CQC to accept them. The cardboard box used to hide from enemy soldiers is now available in two-man versions called Love Boxes, which have different variants. The Surround Indicator in Portable Ops can also be used only when it is equipped in the item box and players will also develop and use an early version of the Soliton radar system from Metal Gear Solid. The game features the camouflage index system from Snake Eater, but the player does not have the ability to change camouflage uniforms during a mission as the point index will be entirely based on movement, position, and the size of the weapon equipped in the weapon box. The player can also use marking devices to call in artillery strikes or resupply drops. \n \nMovement is done on the analog stick; actions such as co-op actions use the directional-pad; melee actions, which include multiple throws into crowds of enemies, use the R button; and weapons use the L button with the R button. Players will be unable to move or shoot while lying down and while pinned on a wall. The player can set the control system according to that of Portable Ops, Guns of the Patriots, or Capcom\u0027s Monster Hunter. \n \nBefore starting a mission, the player can determine his or her character\u0027s item and weapon load-out, including the character\u0027s uniform. The player\u0027s carrying capacity is limited and any excessive items that the player obtains during a mission will be transferred over to Mother Base\u0027s inventory. There are four primary types of uniforms that can be worn by the player. \n \nJungle Fatigues — The default uniform for Snake and MSF Soldiers. A balance of stealth, defense, weapons, and inventory. Available in multiple camouflage patterns. \nNaked — A shirtless version of the Jungle Fatigues, players using Naked uniforms move fast at the cost of lower stealth, weaker defense, and fewer items. \nSneaking Suit — Resembles the sneaking suit worn by Snake in Snake Eater and Portable Ops, it allows players to move without generating foot noises and have higher camouflage compared to other suits while moving, but restricts them to five items and six secondary weapons. \nBattle Dress — A heavily armored suit that allows the player to carry a third primary weapon and absorb heavy firepower, but at the cost of a lower item carrying capacity, slower mobility and a lower camouflage index. A variant outfitted with a helmet is also available, which increases the defenses. \n \nMother Base \nThe Mother Base is an abandoned OTEC research platform in the Caribbean that serves as the MSF\u0027s headquarters. Aside from managing the combat, medical, intelligence, and technology research teams seen in MPO, the player can assign personnel to the mess hall crew to feed the troops and keep up their morale. Rebellious or injured personnel can be brought to the brig and sickbay, respectively. The player will also have a chance to capture military vehicles that appear in the game as minor boss opponents, such as armored personnel carriers, tanks, and attack helicopters. Up to 350 soldiers can be recruited; excess staff caught in a mission must be discharged and up to 50 vehicles can be captured over the course of the game. \n \nItems and weapons are not procured on-site, but rather they\u0027re developed by MSF\u0027s R\u0026D division based on blueprints obtained from missions. New items and weapons can only be developed when the player has sufficient GMP and certain MSF divisions have both reached the required level. Once development of an item has been completed, the R\u0026D staff will automatically mass-produce them for the entire army. \n \nOuter Ops is a new game mechanic where players can deploy their combat unit soldiers (with the exception of Snake and other unique characters) and captured vehicles on certain missions against computer opponents. Each assault force codenamed from Alpha to Hotel has eight slots for assigning vehicles or soldiers, who can gain combat bonuses such as additional hit points and Psyche points, and generate income for the team. Depending on the scale of the enemy\u0027s firepower, MSF soldiers who are defeated during the battle can either die or be brought to sickbay for treatment. Vehicles that show damage in one mission will still show damage unless they are taken off the front for repairs, while decommissioned vehicles will be stricken from the inventory. \n \nMultiplayer \nThe Comrade System from Portable Ops has been removed in favor of a cooperative play mode called \"Co-Ops\", which allows two players to play most sneaking missions and four players in boss missions. There are several actions that can take place when two players are next to each other. \u0027Snake-in\u0027 allows players to hold on to each other as one player leads the way, also allowing the players to fire on the move. Other co-operative actions include holding up closing doors, performing CPR on fallen comrades, sharing items, and acting as a spotter for other players whose vision is obscured. \n \nVersus Ops are multiplayer matches played over special versions of certain maps. The player has a choice of whether to organize individual or team deathmatches, base capture and quetzal capture missions. Only certain items or weapons unlocked in the single-player campaign can be used in the mode. Each match can gather up to six players with restrictions included, such as life and psyche points not regained and limited time for CPR revivals.",
