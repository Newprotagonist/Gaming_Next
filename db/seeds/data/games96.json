The only way for the player to get inside certain areas is by making Raven change into a disguise. There is a fashion area of the game where the player can change how Raven looks in a variety of ways. There is a small number of mini-games.\n\nReception:\nLucas M. Thomas of IGN said that, \"Most games like this deserve ridicule, but that this one doesn\u0027t because the fans will like it. \"Common Sense Media said that the game is well-designed and that it has high entertainment value, but that the game might be too easy for some kids. Matt Paddock of Game Vortex said that the only flaw is the bad grammar and negative talk."

The camera stays directly behind the player character in third-person, or otherwise shifts to first person aim if the player selects the option to zoom in with guns that have the compatible attachments. Objectives can be completed in any order in each mission, with some missions allowing taking any approach to accomplish a goal (Direct Action) while others have certain conditions, such as requiring stealth.\n\nAll missions can be played co-operatively, and each mission features an unlockable \"Dynamic\" Mode, which changes objectives and objective locations, enemy weapons and locations, to random values and points in the environment.",

    "summary": "Set in the near future, Xsyon is an apocalyptic fable. The world draws its inspiration from history, mythology, and prophecies of the Apocalypse. Most aspects of modern life are now gone. Modern vehicles, weapons, appliances, computer and even the books that describe these things are practically nowhere to be found. \n \nYou are a survivor. Your youth was spent lost in times of war. Your memories of the past with its machines, computers, bright lights and buildings reaching for the skies are vague and ever fading, a distant and unreal dream. You grow accustomed to ancient ways that now once again rule the world. \n \nXsyon is an ever changing dynamic world. Players affect the environment by gathering resources, chopping down trees, hunting animals, building towns and developing trade. Players hold the power to create and destroy, to maintain a balance with nature or to cultivate a new civilization. The game is built around environmental, natural, economic, questing, and social systems. These systems are in constant flux and it\u0027s the players interacting with these systems that determine the current state of the virtual world. \n \nXsyon is a fantasy world, but is heavily based on reality. Set in an uncertain apocalyptic future, the virtual world draws upon real life geography, history, science and medicine, fauna and geology are slightly twisted versions of what is real. Whether you are determining what materials to use in a set of armor, trying out ingredient combinations in a recipe or gathering information on the local geography, there is always something new and real you can learn from the Xsyon world. \n \nAs a player, explorer and settler of this new virtual world you have many choices. You can play as a warrior, a trader, a craftsman or a cultivator of crops. You can specialize your skills or become a jack of all trades. You can play as a clan leader or town official, socially involved with many other players, or you can explore the world as a lone adventurer. Xsyon is a game for all kinds of players from casual to hard core. The path you take is up to you. \n \nWhether you are a first day scavenger or a grizzled veteran, Xsyon should be fun. Players begin with a decent set of statistics rather than evolve from a weakling to a super human. You enter the world inexperienced and lacking skill, with strengths and weaknesses, but still as a hero. Rather than grind levels to reach predictable goals, Xsyon is based on change, interactions and consequences. As new quests, lands and features are constantly introduced, there is always something new for you to discover. \n \nBy combining elements of different game genres and social worlds and by blurring the line between fantasy and reality we have created a unique online world. We hope you will find the Xsyon experience fresh, enjoyable, rewarding and full of surprises. \n \nExplore, learn, make friends and create the world you want to live in! Are you with us?",

It has the distinction of being the first MMORPG developed in Argentina. A sequel entitled Argentum 2 was at one point in development.\n\nThe game has had a life outside of the fictional universe, one of the title\u0027s gamemasters noted \"The fact that the Argentum community has transcended the barrier of pure fiction is for most of the players one of the most positive characteristics of the game. One day the idea of having dinner arose, to meet us all.\"\n\nThe developers and fans worked together to create variants and mods of the game, by 2001 four different versions had been made.\n\nThe game\u0027s source code was released in 2003 under the GNU GPL license and can be downloaded from SourceForge.\n\nLa NaciÃ³n described it as a \"local pioneer\" of the RPG genre. PÃ¡gina 12 suggested that the game is an \"anarchic\" game with no owner and instead a \"game of the people\".",

The game offers the Story, VS, and Survival modes, the Network Play up to four players, and the Mission Mode, where specific requirements are needed in order to succeed in the mission, given the grade of how well one did. \n \nEach character has basic attacks (both ranged and melee), a defense power, and a sprint. In addition to each of these basic skills each character has their own special attacks, the effects of which differ greatly between characters. The battlefield where this takes place is in the airspace above a given map. Some places are naught but open area, whereas others may provide cover and obstructions, usually in the form of tall buildings or geological formations. The characters all share a common control scheme, including frequent use of \u0027charging\u0027 attacks.",

The title takes place in 2004 some six years after the events that transpired in Resident Evil 2. The government has destroyed the Umbrella Corporation, which has been behind just about every plot and disgusting bio-chemical mutation in the survival horror series. Now-US agent Leon Kennedy (of Resident Evil 2 fame) has been dispatched to Europe to save the President\u0027s daughter from \"crazed organizations.\" RE4 boasts some of the most impressive visuals to date on Nintendo\u0027s next generation console, and takes the series into the realm of truly three-dimensional gameplay. Stagnant environments found in previous Resident Evil games are replaced by detailed 3D surroundings complete with dynamic camera work.",

One of them is Balkoth, known as the Lord of Death, who worships the dark deity Golgoth. Balkoth has sworn to destroy all other faiths in the name of his own god. The other lords have to expand their ranks and defend themselves against the mad zealot. \n \nLords of Magic is a strategy game that combines turn-based exploration and resource management with real-time combat. The player can choose to control any of the lords who oppose Balkoth. Each nation (faith) commanded by a lord has its own specific units. Before engaging in an offensive, the player must liberate a Great Temple for the faith of his/her choice. It is also necessary to build a stronghold, develop the nation\u0027s capital city, and recruit troops. \n \nThe troops are led by a champion, representing the \"hero\" of the game. This hero can be either a warrior, a thief, or a mage, possessing the classical advantages and disadvantages of these classes: the warrior is good in close combat, the thief can sabotage enemy armies, and the physically weak mage can cast devastating spells. The isometric combat proceeds in real-time, with an option to simply calculate the result of a battle immediately, depending on the participants\u0027 statistics.",

Each mission consists of five elements: a primary objective, secondary objectives, killing a German officer (Nemesis battle in the game), obtaining documents from the officer and escaping. If all are completed, a gold medallion will be given. Missing one or two will gain a silver or bronze. Most missions involve Holt fighting alongside allied NPCs and working towards a common objective, often based on historical events during WWII.

You swear to avenge his crime. But for now, you are just an inexperienced young men, and are \"wanted\" by Nobunaga\u0027s men and ruthless bounty hunters. Will you be able to unite Japan in the ultimate struggle against Nobunaga?",

However, in Lumines Electronic Symphony, an experience point system has been integrated. Now all the points that a player receives in a session are converted into XP, so as the player levels up, additional skins and avatars will be unlocked.\nEach avatar has a single player and multiplayer ability mapped to them.

Although not the real 6000 kilometers can be crossed in the game, the rally mode takes the player through 12 tracks all the way from France to Dakar. The tracks lead racers through cities, forests and the desert. Most of them are simple tracks, but there are desert tracks where the player can drive around freely, finding the checkpoints faster than the opponents. The player can choose from the officially licensed cars, trucks and bikes from Dakar 2002, but only vehicles of the same type can compete in a race. There is also an arcade racing mode, where all the tracks and vehicles that have been unlocked in rally mode can be selected, as well as a splitscreen mode for two players.",

Beginning with smaller-scale criminals (such as shoplifters), the hero will later have to face gangsters, drug lords, and eventually terrorists. For each set of missions, the player characters is being teamed up with another police officer. The gameplay is quite similar to any other of the large live-action laser-gun games found in the arcades - all the player has to do is take the gun (or the mouse in the computer version) and show those criminals who\u0027s the boss!",

    "summary": "Densha de Go![a] is a 1997 train simulator arcade game developed and published by Taito in Japan. Players are tasked with guiding a train to its destination under a time limit while managing its acceleration and speed limitations. It features real-world train stations and train lines from Japan, including the Yamanote Line and Keihin-Tohoku Line. The game was ported to several home consoles, including the Nintendo 64 and PlayStation.\n\nThe concept for Densha de Go! was inspired by designer Akira Saito\u0027s personal fascination with Japanese train lines and railroads. He wanted to create a game that allowed players to familiarize themselves with driving a train. The controls were his primary focus as he wanted them to be accurate and responsive, and to mimic the controls of a real trainâhis father worked for the Kyoto City Transportation Bureau Facilities Division, which made this easier to accomplish. Saito included real-world railroads and trains to appeal towards other railroad enthusiasts, thinking that it could also attract more \"ordinary\" players for its realistic, familiar theme. As arcades at the time were dominated primarily by racing and fighting games, he believed its unique concept could make it stand out.\n\nDensha de Go! is among Taito\u0027s most successful games, preceded only by Space Invaders. The PlayStation version sold over one million copies. The game was well-received by critics for its controls, attention to detail, and unique concept. Some felt that its home releases lacked enough content and had poor visuals. It was followed by a long series of sequels, spin-offs, and reimaginings, beginning with Densha de Go! 2 in 1999.",

The game was ported to several home consoles, including the Nintendo 64 and PlayStation.\n\nThe concept for Densha de Go! was inspired by designer Akira Saito\u0027s personal fascination with Japanese train lines and railroads. He wanted to create a game that allowed players to familiarize themselves with driving a train. The controls were his primary focus as he wanted them to be accurate and responsive, and to mimic the controls of a real trainâhis father worked for the Kyoto City Transportation Bureau Facilities Division, which made this easier to accomplish. Saito included real-world railroads and trains to appeal towards other railroad enthusiasts, thinking that it could also attract more \"ordinary\" players for its realistic, familiar theme. As arcades at the time were dominated primarily by racing and fighting games, he believed its unique concept could make it stand out.\n\nPorts for the Game Boy Color and WonderSwan were published in 2000.",

The games producer Koichiro Sakamoto indicated that a survey of the series fans showed that most did not play games on their cell phones, and so Square Enix decided to bring it to the Nintendo DS. This remake of Front Mission 2089 featured completely remade visuals, new character artwork, new cut-scene events, a rewritten story, new game scenarios, and new battle maps. Also incorporated in the game were touchscreen features and a revised interface for more intuitive touchpad controls. Likewise, various game play mechanics from other Front Mission entries such as armor coating and linked attacks were added to Front Mission 2089: Border of Madness. Multiplayer mode had to be dropped due to space issues on the Nintendo DS.",

With the incredibly exciting 2019 World Cup and the fiercely fought Australia tour of England, a legion of fans have been attracted to the sport. The inaugural 100 ball competition promised to provide great entertainment for those new converts, and the first test-match championship was well under way. After canvassing our players, we have decided to create the 2020 season as it was originally intended, in all its glory. \n \nRain delays in one-day and 20 over matches have been introduced, including the Duckworth-Lewis-Stern system to calculate run-chase targets. There are also extensive additions to the database, including additional season by season player records. \n \nThe new 100 ball competition in England has been added, including updates to the match engine, AI and stats systems to accommodate the new format. Updates to domestic systems around the world have also been incorporated, including major changes to the competitions in Australia, South Africa, Bangladesh, Pakistan and India. Captains will also be able to switch between domestic teams in different countries for the first time. \n \nCricket Captain 2020 also features a full database update (over 7,000 players, including every historical international player), with improved player ability generation, using data from every form of cricket and with input from a team of researchers around the world. The database provides the attention to detail that the series is famed for. \n \nCricket Captain is unrivalled in cricket management simulation, and Cricket Captain 2020 improves the series once again. Put your tactical expertise to the test in the number one cricket management game. \n \nKey features for 2020 include: \n- Rain delays in one-day and 20 Over matches: introducing the Duckworth-Lewis-Stern method for the first time in Cricket Captain. \n- Improved weather simulation for all match types: including more realistic weather patterns, and extra time to recover lost overs. \n- The new 100 ball competition in England: a brand-new format, played between eight city-based teams. \n- Updates to all domestic systems and 20 over leagues: play updated domestic leagues in South Africa, India, England, Australia, West Indies, Pakistan, Bangladesh, and New Zealand. \n- Ability to switch teams between countries: play a full career mode, switch between teams across domestic systems. \n- Improved player generation system: using data from every form of cricket combined with input from a team of researchers around the world. \n- Improved match engine: with updates to bowler AI, spin bowler ability in T20 matches, and batsman scoring rates. \n- Current/last competition stats: see details of current and last competition stats for all formats. \n- Historical scenarios: Play in Classic England test series vs West Indies or Pakistan. \n- Tournament Modes: Play in stand-alone One Day or 20 Over World Cups.
