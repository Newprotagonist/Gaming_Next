The Tower of Ar tonelico from Metafalss is different from the tower in the first game since it doesn\u0027t look like a tower initially, but still has some of the same essential facilities (Rinkernator, Plasma Bell (represented as the Lift Generators) and Musical Corridor). The Song Magics are still used like programs, but in this tower there are two Song Magic servers: the Sol Marta server and the Infel Phira Server. The Sol Marta server is located in the upper zone of the tower, acting like a stationary satellite. It is collocated with the S. P. U. and Rinkernator and is the main server for the tower. The Infel Phira server is located in a satellite that orbits the sky around the tower and shares its name with said server. The Sol Marta satellite is a relay station used to increase the range of Song Magic usage of the first tower, so it works with the same kind of hymmnos and executes the EXEC variety of hymns. Plus, it also has the function of receiving energy from the first tower and sending it to the second tower. On the other hand, the Infel Phira server works with another kind of hymmnos called the Pastalia hymmnos, and executes the METHOD variety of hymns.",

Your mind is foggy. You only know you are here for a reason. The forest called you here because it needs you.\n\nThe world of Druidstone is a vast procedurally generated forest where you explore ancient ruins, battle monsters with spells and swords, and meet interesting friends and foes. Battles will be fought on a two-dimensional grid using a tactical, turn-based battle system. Using your limited resources wisely is important for surviving in this dangerous world. You start the game barehanded, only clad in a simple cloak but as you discover the secrets of the Menhir Forest you will get more powerful and learn new abilities and battle tactics. At the heart of Druidstone is a gripping story which is told through the encounters and characters you will meet. Perhaps you will team up with an ally or two along the way?\"",

    "summary": "bit Generations: Dialhex is a Game Boy Advance video game released in 2006 by Nintendo and skip, Ltd. The game was part of the initial batch of bit Generations games. The game was not released in America or Europe, but a remake of the game, titled Art Style: ROTOHEX for the Wii\u0027s WiiWare service, was released two years later in 2008. The remake was slightly different, though was instantly recognizable to fans of Dialhex. \n \nGameplay \nIn Dialhex, you turn differently colored triangles on a playing field. The goal of the game is to turn them in a way so that you create a hexagon that contains triangles of the same color. After doing so, you\u0027ll be rewarded a set amount of points and the triangles within the hexagon will disappear, with the triangles in the surrounding areas taking their place. The board itself is in the shape of a hexagon, and triangles will continually fall down from the top. Once they hit another triangle, they\u0027ll stop moving, waiting for the player to make use of them. If the player has destroyed most of the triangles on the stage, and the amount of triangles is a bare minimum, then they can press the L and R button, or the A and B button, at the same time to cause the triangles that drop to come down faster. The triangles will also start to drop faster as the player progresses through the game. \n \nOnce you start a new game, you\u0027ll be given just two colors (in the start, green and orange). After six hexagons have been created, then another color will be added to the mix, and will start to drop down from above. In all, the colors, including the ones mentioned, are green, orange, yellow, red, blue, purple, cyan, and a darker green. \n \nAfter you\u0027ve reached a certain point in the game\u0027s main mode, you\u0027ll be given access to the title\u0027s endless mode. In endless mode, you\u0027ll keep on going for as long as you possibly can, trying to rank up as many points as possible. The game starts similarly to the title\u0027s main mode, and new colors will start to drop just as they did in that mode too. The only difference is that it never ends until the player gets a gameover. In order to unlock the staff credits, you just need to create six cyan hexagons in the game\u0027s main mode. After doing this the credits will be available on the game\u0027s main screen.",

    "summary": "Tropix! is a unique blend of eleven different games, all set within a sunny island paradise. The game combines many classic gameplay ideas in one title, delivering a large amount of variety and keeps the game experience fresh.\n\nThe eleven games are all linked to a central theme - collecting sand dollars to enable you to travel to new islands, buy toys and food for your Tamagotchi-style monkey, and unlock even more games to play.\n\nEach mini game offers the player a different gameplay experience. These are some of them:\n\nPuffer Popper\nWith help from Crab the player must defend the sand castle by destroying bubbles as they snake towards the beach.\n\nA classic and instantly playable concept, Puffer Popper requires the player to connect three bubbles of the same colour to win. Use the left and right joystick or directional pad to aim the beam, and press the action button to fire a bubble.\n\nThe game can be increased in difficulty through the addition of multiple Puffer fish and by potentially removing the players aiming beam.\n\nJungle Jump\nJungle jump is a game of timing and skill. Use the left and right buttons on the joystick or directional pad to guide the Monkey through increasingly difficult jungle levels.\n\nShell Game\nThe shell game is both a game of skill and observation coupled with a way to win more Sand Dollars. Conceptually the Shell Game is extremely simple: three shells that swap, the user must pick the shell that hides the pearl.\n\nDue to the high expense of certain shop items and the cost of purchasing new islands, the user can use the Shell Game to win the Sand Dollars required to make these large purchases.\n\nSandoku\nThe classic favorite Sudoku makes the transition to Tropix effectively, with intuitive play.\n\nCascade\nCascade is a casual concept. The game is a variation on the classic objective of connecting three of a kind. This type of game can be controlled exclusively via the joystick or directional pad with the addition of the action button to make selections.\n\nThe overall design is about linking these mini-games into a \"world\" where you buy things, look after a creature, travel around and explore. For casual gamers, Tropix is simple to play, and can be played in short bites or in long sessions.",

From this medicinal arms race the NCR (Nano Core Robot) was born – a new and highly effective weapon in the war against sickness.

    "summary": "O\u0027Leary Manager 2000 is a football player-manager game released in 2000 for the Game Boy Color. The player can choose whether they want to focus on the management side of football, play the matches themselves on the game\u0027s 2D match engine, or combine the two features for a more in-depth experience. It is endorsed by Irish football manager David O\u0027Leary, who was managing Leeds United A.F.C. at the time of the game\u0027s release.\n\nThe management side of O\u0027Leary Manager 2000 is very comprehensive when compared to similar Game Boy Color games. The player can choose from 240 fully licensed teams from the top two leagues in England, France, Italy, Spain, Germany and the Netherlands to play as or manage, with each team having 16 players in their squad. There is also the option to promote a number of fictional youth team players. However, most of the youth team players are of low ability, so could only realistically be used for back-up when managing a decent quality team.\n\nAs with any football management game, the transfer market can often play a key role in whether the team achieves success. The player\u0027s selected team starts with either 10.5m or 5.5m to spend, depending on whether they were in the first or second tier of their country\u0027s football hierarchy. The player can also recoup some money by selling players to other teams. This is done by first offering the footballer for sale at a chosen price, from which interested clubs would then place offers that the player could choose to accept or not. Once a price is agreed, the footballer transfers clubs instantly. The values of footballers alternate greatly during the game, with the then Real Betis striker Denílson being the most expensive player at the start of the game. An unfortunate bug in the game allows the player to gain a huge sum of money (around 70m) if the club goes into a certain amount of debt, which pretty much negates the need for financial planning.\n\nThe club\u0027s board of directors constantly give assessments as to how they think the club is progressing under your management. This involves a short statement visible at the menu screen. Other features available the menu screen include options to change you team line-up, formation and tactics; all vital when creating a successful team.\n\nSimilarly, you can decide what methods of training your team will undertake for the coming week. You have the option to \"do training\", which generally increase the statistics of your players (but at the risk of injuring them) or to concentrate on fitness training (which helps players stay fit and injured players to recover quicker). Alternatively, you may choose to skip training entirely for the week. You also have the option to view various statistics, such as league tables from around the world, top goalscorers and to view the squads of all available teams on the game.",

    "summary": "Tekken 3 maintains the same core fighting system and concept as its predecessors, but brings many improvements, such as significantly more detailed graphics and animations, fifteen new characters added to the game\u0027s roster, more modern music and faster and more fluid gameplay.\nPerhaps the most noticeable change from Tekken 2 fight system is movement reform - whereas the element of depth had been largely insignificant in previous Tekken games (aside from some characters having unique sidesteps and dodging maneuvers), Tekken 3 added emphasis on the third axis, allowing all characters to sidestep in or out of the background by lightly pressing the arcade stick (or tapping the controller button in the console version) towards the corresponding direction. Another big change in movement was that jumping was toned down, no longer allowing fighters to jump to extreme heights (as was present in previous games), but keeping leaps to reasonable, realistic heights. It made air combat more controllable, and put more use to sidestep dodges, as jumping no longer became a universal dodge move that was flying above all of the ground moves. Other than that, the improved engine allowed for quick recoveries from knock-downs, more escapes from tackles and stuns, better juggling (as many old moves had changed parameters, allowing them to connect in combo-situations, where they wouldn\u0027t connect in previous games) and extra newly created combo throws.\n\nTekken 3 was the first Tekken to feature a beat \u0027em up minigame called \"Tekken Force\", which pitted the player in various stages against enemies in a side-scrolling fashion. If the player succeeds in beating the minigame four times, Dr. Bosconovitch would be a playable character (granted that you defeat him first). This was continued in Tekken 4 and succeeded by the Devil Within minigame in Tekken 5 - but Boskonovitch was dropped as a playable character after Tekken 3. There is also a minigame \"Tekken Ball\", similar to beach volleyball, where one has to hit the ball with a powerful attack to hurt the opponent or try to hit the ball in such a way that it hits the ground in the opponent\u0027s area, thus causing damage.",

In fact, this version, now dubbed \u0027Long Road Ahead\u0027, is pretty much exactly the one we graduated with.\n\nWe are uploading it here in order to clear our heads, re-process our development and design processes that led us to this version, and to gather feedback. We hope that all of this will help us with development of the new version of Northbound, so please let us know if you liked it.\n\nIf you are interested, please follow us on Twitter for updates on the current state of development.",

The game is much more open-ended allowing for multiple ways to reach your target and complete objectives. The player is accompanied by a companion drone called the OWL which can help you in many different ways including deploying a zip-line or stunning the enemy. Using futuristic weapons and gear allows for new stealth gameplay. The online multiplayer mode allows for up to 24-players to battle at once on any of the games default 10 maps. The level system is now challenge-based where completing any of the games many challenges will upgrade your rank. Warzone returns as an online game mode along with Team Deathmatch and Beacon Retrieval (Capture the Flag).

    "summary": "Blitz: The League is an American football game by Midway as an unlicensed extension of their NFL Blitz series. Released after the NFL signed an exclusive licensing deal with Electronic Arts, it was released in October 2005 for the PlayStation 2 and Xbox. This game is the first in the Blitz series to receive an \"M\" rating by the ESRB due to the graphic violence, explicit language, and drug use depicted. Lawrence Taylor, who provides voice acting for the game, serves as its official spokesman. In 2006, a second version of the game was released on the Xbox 360 in October. In December 2006, a portable version was released on the PlayStation Portable (under the title Blitz: Overtime). These versions included the voicework and likeness of former pro linebacker Bill Romanowski. The game was originally intended to be a Wii launch title, but the Wii-version was delayed[1] and eventually canceled.[2]\n\nOn January 22, 2007, the game was refused classificatio by the Office of Film and Literature Classification in Australia, effectively banning the game there. The game was banned as the use of drugs was related to incentives and rewards.",

Executions are preferred in order to gain a higher score, thus encouraging players to play as viscerally as possible.

The game was re-released in 1998 through the Nintendo Power service, adding Super Game Boy support and featuring a bestiary for encountered monsters; this version was called God Medicine Hukkokuban. \n \nA video gaming company was to release Phantom, their new RPG, but the company mysteriously is destroyed. Noah, Ken, and Miki are three RPG fans that are disappointed by this. Wandering about, they stumble upon a shack with a great demon inside, battling three warriors. The warriors are defeated and the demon exits through a portal. The warriors give their souls and powers to the three RPG fans, who now must enter Phantom to save the game\u0027s world. However, they must also protect the real world from the demon. \n \nGod Medicine features standard RPG elements. The three characters can level up through battle and equip weapons and armor. Spells can be learned, as well as Maphu attacks. After the party collects Maphu gems and gains the special Maphu weapons, they can put the gems in the weapons. Each gem has a different effect depending on what character equips it. Some Maphu attacks need to be charged during battle first. The charges last even if the battle is finished. The player can save anytime, except in battle.",

After having a psychedelic dream one day, Zak realizes that something is wrong -- space aliens are dumbifying the general public through the telephone system. Zak must stop this, but he can\u0027t do it alone. After finding a strange crystal, Zak manages to get the help of the anthropologist Annie and her friends, Melissa and Leslie. The four unlikely heroes must now figure out a way to destroy the dumbifying devices and save the Earth.\n\nZak McKracken and the Alien Mindbenders is a third-person puzzle-solving adventure similar in gameplay to Lucasfilm\u0027s breakthrough title Maniac Mansion. The player chooses verb commands (Open, Pick Up, Give, etc.; there are no Look or Talk commands) to interact with the game world. The game features up to four controllable protagonists; it is possible to switch between them at any time after they have been introduced, and also exchange inventory items if the characters are in the same location. The game can be described as a \"globe-trotting\" adventure, since the heroes are required to travel to different exotic countries and even leave the Earth for a while in order to complete it. Some of the puzzles are optional or can be solved in different ways.\n\nThe FM Towns version has VGA graphics with 256 colors and higher-quality music and sound effects.",

The Dominion of Rubrum uses the Vermillion Bird Crystal, which controls magic; the Milites Empire controls the White Tiger Crystal, containing the power of science and weapons; the Kingdom of Concordia uses the Azure Dragon Crystal, containing the power of Dragons; and the Lorican Alliance is home to the Black Tortoise Crystal, containing the power of shielding. Each nation has an academy, or Peristylium, to research and protect the country\u0027s respective crystal. The crystals have the ability to mark humans as their countries\u0027 servants. These servants, called l\u0027Cie, are branded with a symbol and are given a \"Focus\", a task to complete. While blessed with long life and the ability to transform into crystal, l\u0027Cie are cursed to lose their memories over time. The people of Orience also lose their memories of the dead, so they will not be held back by any past regrets and continue strengthening their souls through conflict, a mechanism put in place by the crystals for the convenience of the deities who crafted them. The main aim of many characters is to become Agito, a legendary figure who will appear and save the world from Tempus Finis, an apocalyptic event that will destroy Orience.",

Trainers that win the Tournament get a huge prize as well as world wide renown.\n\nYou, a 13-year-old kid from Moki Town, did not set out to become a Pokemon Master. After your mother Lucille died ten years ago in an accident at a nuclear power plant, your father Kellyn, the top Pokemon Ranger in the Tandor Ranger Union, left you with your elderly aunt and departed to travel the region. But now that you are grown up, your aunt can no longer support you. Out of a home, you did what most kids your age do and took up Pokémon training as a means to make a living.\n\nProfessor Bamb\u0027o, regional expert on Pokémon elements, has been looking for a trainer assistant to travel the region and gather specimens of the varied wildlife. You step up to the challenge, along with your rival, a younger boy named Theo. After taking a test and receiving your starter Pokémon, you head towards your first gym challenge in Nowtoch city, and take your first steps exploring the Tandor region.\n\nThings aren\u0027t as sunny as they first seem, though. Just when the accident ten years ago had been all but forgotten, new mysteries emerge. A new power plant is built over the site of the old one. Your father begins acting strangely, journeying to the far reaches of the region and questioning whether your mother is really deceased. Sinister Pokemon, corrupted by nuclear radiation, threaten innocent people. In the midst ofthe turmoil, it seems that an impending disaster is looming over Tandor... You may be in for more than you expected.",

    "summary": "L.A. Noire is set in Los Angeles in 1947 and challenges the player, controlling a Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) officer, to solve a range of cases across five divisions. Players must investigate crime scenes for clues, follow up leads, and interrogate suspects, and the player\u0027s success at these activities will impact how much of each case\u0027s story is revealed.\n\nThe game draws heavily from both the plot and aesthetic elements of film noir, stylistic films made popular in the 1940s and 1950s that share similar visual styles and themes, including crime and moral ambiguity. The game uses a distinctive colour palette, but in homage to film noir it includes the option to play the game in black and white. Various plot elements reference the major themes of detective and mobster stories such as Key Largo, Chinatown, The Untouchables, The Black Dahlia, and L.A. Confidential.\n\nL.A. Noire is notable for using Depth Analysis\u0027s newly developed technology MotionScan, whereby the actors portraying the game\u0027s characters were recorded by 32 surrounding cameras to capture facial expressions from every angle. The technology is central to the game\u0027s interrogation mechanic, as players must use the suspects\u0027 reactions to questioning to judge whether or not they are lying. L.A. Noire was the first video game to be shown at the Tribeca Film Festival. Upon release, the game received wide acclaim for its advances in storytelling and facial animation technology. As of February 2012, both PC and console versions had shipped nearly 5 million copies combined.\n\nIn addition to the original full game, L.A. Noire: The Complete Edition for PC will include a multi-use code to access all the previously released downloadable content from the console versions, including the “Nicholson Electroplating” Arson case, the “Reefer Madness” Vice case, “The Consul’s Car” Traffic case, “The Naked City” Vice case and “A Slip of the Tongue” Traffic case.",

Unfortunately, the King\u0027s over-exuberance creates a tsunami that strikes and devastates nearby Paradise Commonwealth Island. One of the residents, a turtle, washes ashore next to the Royal Family and tells them his tale. The King then decides to make new islands for the animals of the Commonwealth with several katamari. Similar to the previous Katamari titles, the King sends the Prince to the Sunflower Continent, which is full of the paraphernalia used to create new landmasses.",

A bar at the bottom of the screen represents the power that you have to use for the moves. You start the first round on 0, and each attack that you make adds power to the bar. Once you reach level 3, you can unleash the special attacks, that can sometimes KO the opponent.\n\nThe other major change over the Street Fighter 2 series are the Alpha counters. These can be used to counter an on-coming attack after blocking.",

The events of the game take place shortly before those of \"Eve Burst Error\". Kojiroh is working at Katsuragi Detective Office together with his girlfriend Yayoi. Dr. Nishina, the head of a genetic research facility, hires Kojiroh to investigate the disappearance of his son Shin. At the same time, Marina receives an assignment from her boss Kono, which involves watching over a representative of an American company. As in all EVE games, the two stories appear unrelated in the beginning and are gradually linked together later in the game. \n \nEver wondered what was Marina\u0027s previous assignment, with whom did Kyoko Himuro work before, or what exactly happened to Genzaburo Katsuragi when he was still the chief of Katsuragi Detective Office? Cared to know more about the appealing protagonist, Kojiroh Amagi? \"Eve Zero\" gives the answers to those questions.",

He hopes to collect enough crystals to start a profitable twibble farm. \n \nCrystal Caves is a side-scrolling platform game, where the objective is to finish all 16 levels, collecting every single crystal within. On his way, Mylo is threatened by numerous monsters, such as bats, robots, mine carts or dinosaurs; there are also a lot of hazards such as stalactites and stalagmites, pipes which leak harmful water or poisonous mushrooms which kill instantly. Mylo has three health points, and if he is harmed enough times to deplete them all, he dies (but thankfully he has unlimited lives). To defend himself, Mylo has a missile pistol, which is able to take out most enemies, but not all. Many levels require the player to act fast and plan beforehand, as it\u0027s easy to get Mylo stuck in an impossible-to-win situation - if this happens, the level must be restarted. \n \nApart from the crystals, the levels contain a lot of items to collect: ammunition for the pistol, bonus items such as pickaxes or purple mushrooms that give score, and eggs which turn into letters when shot - collecting all 5 letters (B, O, N, U, S) on a level gives a lot of points, but it\u0027s not always easy to get them! It\u0027s also possible to find a power-up that reverses gravity when picked up, another one which gives your pistol the power to kill every enemy, a stop sign which freezes all enemies and makes them harmless and a red mushroom which allows you to kill enemies by running into them. These power-ups last only for a limited time though, so be careful, as they are always instrumental to victory!",

The game celebrates generations of multi-disciplinary motorsport, focusing on driving that feels great - but with a high skill ceiling that will have players spending hours honing their perfect lap. Starting out is simple but learning the nuances of each car\u0027s handling and finding the best racing line through each corner of each track will be a challenge for a long time to come. Not only that, but with the option of fuel usage, tire degradation and racing damage, even a good pit stop strategy could make the difference between hero and zero. Feel the rubber bite into the road as you pass the start/finish line and dive, brakes squealing, into the first corner!",

The concept is simple : crash for cash by creating the biggest car crash.  \n  \nThe Danger Zone is a virtual Crash Testing Facility where players step into the shoes of a dangerous driver and are challenged to survive a variety of spectacular crash testing scenarios.  \n  \nIt’s easy to crash, but can you also grab all of the Bonus Pickups?  \n  \nPowered by Unreal Engine, Danger Zone combines real physical crashes with explosive gameplay. Shunt vehicles into oncoming traffic, take down trailers to shed their payloads and use your explosive “SmashBreaker” to move your vehicle around. The more explosions you cause, the bigger your score.  \n  \nIf you’re feeling burnt out by congestion and jammed roads, take the highway to the Danger Zone. Take your revenge on rush hour traffic. This place is a paradise for those who like their driving flame-grilled.",
