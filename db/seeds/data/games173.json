Plotwise, the game is identical to the original.\n\nThe game is a side-scroller with the character walking slowly. Dirk can walk, crawl, or jump forward, and he has an array of weapons that he can discover and use to dispose of enemies. The controller layout is reversed from other mainstream NES titles, with Select functioning as the Pause-button while Start is used for the Candle object (which helps reveal hidden weapons). Also, B is used for jumping, and A for attacking (the input of the A \u0026 B buttons is almost always the opposite in similar NES games).",

The game has been ported to Playstation Portable with the title of Shin Megami Tensei: Persona and featured new cutscenes and a redone localization. The story focuses on a group of high school students as they are confronted by a series of supernatural incidents. After playing a fortune-telling game, the group each gain the ability to summon Personas, the multiple selves within them. Using this power under the guidance of Philemon, a benevolent being representing humanity\u0027s subconscious, the group face off against multiple forces that threaten the world. Gameplay revolves around the characters navigating environments around their town and fighting enemies using their Personas. During the course of the game, the player can create new Personae for battle using spell cards gained in battle or by talking with enemies.",

Now, hunted by incumbent powers desperate to reclaim the girl and armed with a weapon capable of reshaping the realm, the Resistance must wage war to deliver themselves from the tyranny of their oppressors. \nAs original as its narrative, Gungnir\u0027s strategy RPG mechanics offer a number of fresh twists on an expertly honed formula. Building upon the traditional action queue of turn-based strategy RPGs, actions in Gungnir all have a numerical wait interval associated with them. Faster actions bear smaller numbers, allowing them to precede slower preexisting attacks. Should the player wish, they may sacrifice tactical points, which afford them more combat options, in order to accelerate actions. This classic balance of risk and reward, a staple of Sting titles, enriches the Gungnir\u0027s deep strategic battles and gives the player far more critical decisions to weigh.",

The game marked Pierce Brosnan\u0027s fourth appearance as James Bond before the release of his fourth and final Bond film Die Another Day. His likeness was featured in the game, but not his voice, which was provided by Maxwell Caulfield. Overall there are many weapons that the player can carry including grenades of various sorts and other types of explosives. In addition, there are numerous amounts of mounted weapons found throughout the game. As with previous James Bond games, the weapons that appear are based on actual weapons, but with the names changed. Some weapons appear in the console version but not the PC version, and vice-versa.",

During a single turn, a team can only move one of its worms. Worms can crawl and jump, as well as swing by ninja-rope, parachute, teleport, and bungee when the appropriate items are available. The objective of a traditional match or campaign mission is to defeat all opposing teams by killing their worms. When hit with a weapon, the worm will lose health depending on the power of the weapon and the directness of the hit. A worm can be killed either by having its health reduced to zero or being knocked into the water around and below the level.",

    "summary": "Fallout 3 from the creators of the award-winning Oblivion, featuring one of the most realized game worlds ever created. Create any kind of character you want and explore the open wastes of post-apocalyptic Washington D.C. Every minute is a fight for survival as you encounter Super Mutants, Ghouls, Raiders and other dangers of the Wasteland. Prepare for the future.\n\nThe third game in the Fallout series, Fallout 3 is a singleplayer action role-playing game (RPG) set in a post-apocalyptic Washington DC. Combining the horrific insanity of the Cold War era theory of mutually assured destruction gone terribly wrong, with the kitschy naivety of American 1950s nuclear propaganda, Fallout 3 will satisfy both players familiar with the popular first two games in its series as well as those coming to the franchise for the first time.",

There are two tasks alternating through levels: you are required either to kill every enemy in the level (as in the previous games) or simply to reach the exit. Running into enemies usually won’t kill you, however if you are hit by a single projectile, you’ll have to start from a checkpoint. Enemies vary from plain ninjas to giant skeletons or killer fish. Each level has a time limit, and when this limit is close to an end a fire wheel of death will appear on the screen, chasing Ninja-kun.\n\nNinja-kun has some techniques for successful progression though the levels: many enemies can be temporarily stunned by jumping on them or hitting them from below; and ninja can obtain some power-ups including boomerang, bombs, a devastating fire attack or invincibility. Ninja-kun is capable of wall climbing and wall jumping, the latter requiring some practice from the player.\n\nThe levels (called “scenes” in-game) are scattered through mountains, caves, beaches and underwater locations. You can choose which set of levels you’ll start in by playing a mini-game at the beginning.",

The game also features the 2 and 5 minute high score time attack modes seen in previous games.\n\nHowever, in parodying the hard sci-fi atmosphere of the Star Soldier games, Star Parodier takes a light hearted approach by featuring cute, cartoonish graphics and toning down the violence (for example, defeated enemies wave white flags in surrender). The players choose from one of three craft to play as in the game: the Paro Ceaser from Star Soldier, a giant flying Bomberman or an anthropomorphic PC Engine console that shoots HuCards and CD-ROMs at enemies.\n\nThe game was originally only released in Japan, though it was also intended to be released in North America under the name Fantasy Star Soldier.",

At the beginning of each round, the player decides which panels to use to complete the round. Another difference is that the linear gameplay of the original, with the player advancing levels after completing each one, was changed to implement a world map with nine locations.\n\nThe second game mode, \"Game B\" (known as \"Bomber Man\" in the Japanese version) is the same as that in the original Bomberman game, but the stage area is squared rather than rectangular and the screen is always centered on Bomberman rather than scrolling when he touches the border.\n\nVs.:\n\nPanel Mode, in which players begin with only one bomb to place at a time and a bomb blast length of one unit, and Bomb Up and Fire Up panels appear.\n\nPowerful Mode, in which players have four bombs to place at a time and a bomb blast length of four units, and no panels appear.",

    "summary": "Pokémon Channel is a 2003 video game in the Pokémon series for the GameCube, developed by Ambrella and published by Nintendo and The Pokémon Company. The player\u0027s goal is to help Professor Oak refine and promote his TV network through watching broadcasts with a Pikachu. The game contains elements of the adventure, digital pet, and simulation genres. The player can explore full 3D environments, have Pikachu converse with other Pokémon, and collect various items. \n \nThe game was developed rather quickly as a sequel to the Nintendo 64 title Hey You, Pikachu! and to promote the Nintendo e-Reader accessory, and uses a novel 3D texturing effect. It was first showcased at Electronic Entertainment Expo (E3) 2003 and later through a month-long series of promotional events in Sapporo, Hokkaido, Japan. It was released on July 18, 2003, in Japan, December 1 in North America, and April 2, 2004, in Europe. In Japan, the game sold 66,373 copies in its first year. It received mixed reviews, which generally criticized its low level of interactivity and repetitive sound effects, though its collecting aspects and visuals were somewhat better received.",

    "summary": "Buzz!: Quizz World is the ninth game in the Buzz! series of quiz games.\nIt allows users to use question packs purchased for previous Buzz! games as well as supporting user created content and online play. Unlike the previous PSP Buzz!, Buzz: Quiz World (PSP) supports DLC. As with all previous Buzz games the game is available in a game only (Solus) version or in a bundle which includes 4 wireless Buzz! Buzzers and a USB dongle for wireless connectivity (each dongle can connect 4 buzzers to the PlayStation 3).\n\nQuiz World features a mix of old and new round types. For example, one new round hides the answers and then slowly reveals them.\nA new feature in Quiz World is player profiling and the host Buzz addressing the player by name, informing them of their abilities and record as a player.\n\nBuzz!: Quiz World also supported PlayStation Home rewards that are rewarded by winning the prize after a round of Buzz!: Quiz World. It supports full game launching for PlayStation Home as well.\n\nIn late-March 2010, Sony and Relentless released a patch for Buzz!: Quiz World that added a feature to allow players to post to Facebook from within the game. According to the companies involved, this made the game the first in the world to offer such functionality. The patched Facebook features allow players to post details of the game session just played, including the in-game names of those who took part, and who won.",

Gamers can play as their favorite Turtle alone or with up to three friends, earning experience points along the way as they slash and bash Foot Ninjas and powerful, well-known bosses from the TMNT universe. These experience points allow players to improve and evolve their Turtles\u0027 traits and abilities for more varied, powerful attacks and moves. The Ninja Scroll System is another new feature on TMMT3. Being able to select which ninja scrolls to use allows the Turtles to use various special abilities strategically. Cooperative play lies at the heart of TMNT3 and gamers who team up with friends for multiplayer action are rewarded with exclusive features such as Cooperative Attack for even more shell shocking damage to enemies. The effect of this attack changes depending on the number of players working together (between 2-4 players). For even greater control, TMNT3 features a new combat system called the Target Attack system that lets gamers play more instinctively and strategically. With the Target Attack system, players will be able to lock onto specific enemies and block, dodge or counter attack accordingly for smoother and more maneuverable combat. Story Mode can be played with 1-4 players. Even when you have less than 4 players to play, the other Turtles will be at your side, controlled through AI. All the Turtles can participate in Cooperative Attack to beat enemies and players can give commands to the AI.",

The goal of the game is essentially to cause your opponent to lose by causing their gameplay field to fill to the top with objects. You do this by causing chains of bombs to explode, sending useless rubble over to your opponent\u0027s field, which they must then remove themselves. Bombs are earned by causing chains of three identical blocks to disappear. Bombs can only be blown up with an explosion from a lit bomb, which falls from the top of the screen every so often. If the player causes enough damage, they can eventually earn a giant bomb, which will remove a large amount of debris from the playing field, and cause their opponent a good deal of trouble.\n\nThe game\u0027s regular story mode revolves around Bomberman\u0027s hunt for the Golden Bomber statue. During his trek, he fights against several different odd characters, like Drifty the balloon, or Cecil the tiger. However, all that can really be earned from playing through this mode is a harder difficulty level, earned by finishing the entire story at the \"hard\" difficulty level.",

Hell Island: Great Adventure of 7 Islands) is an action-adventure game developed for the Famicom and MSX home computer, and released by Capcom in 1987. It is a sequel to a 1984 arcade game developed by Capcom known as Pirate Ship Higemaru. Neither the arcade game, nor this adventure adaptation were released outside Japan, although a prototype exists for a canceled North American NES release, where it was to be renamed \"Makai Island\".\n\nIn Higemaru Makaijima, the hero from Pirate Ship Higemaru named Momotaru must now pilot his own sailing vessel around the ocean surrounding seven islands. His goal is to find the greatest treasure. To do this, he must collect the keys which open the dock gates to each of the islands by invading several pirate ships and defeating the captain on board in combat. The gameplay on these pirate ships are taken directly from the arcade predecessor, with some small modifications.\n\nOnce Momotaru has collected a key from a pirate ship, he must then sail around the islands in search of the correct dock gate which the key corresponds to. Once there, the player embarks on an exploration of the island to find items, defeat a boss, and collect treasures before heading off in search of another island key. The island exploration sections are extremely reminiscent of dungeon exploration aspects of The Legend of Zelda, to which the game is often compared to.",

Of course, you\u0027re not required to race every single time you play -- you can explore the tracks for said gates, finding shortcuts that will give you an advantage over the opposition.\n\nRadio-controlled vehicles are based on performance ratings including speed, acceleration, grip and weight. There are four cars to choose from at the start of the game; whereas Krush is average in all areas, the Flame Dragon has incredible handling and acceleration features. Tracks incorporate surreal environments such as beachside raceways, mountainous terrain and a desert.",

There are many types of units to choose from: some specializing in powerful short-range attacks, some wielding far-reaching magicks, and still others equipped with bows, enabling them to bring down aerial foes. Deploy units in strategic locations to take full advantage of their traits. Each time an enemy breaches your defenses and reaches a map\u0027s exit, your party will lose crystals. When all your crystals are gone, the game is over. R2 offers several new, challenging maps containing multiple entrances and exits. It also introduces three varieties of Power Crystals, allowing you to enhance the abilities of your units, while new jobs, including Flintlock and Tinker, set the stage for even more complex strategies. Can you defend all the maps without losing a single crystal?",

    "summary": "Final Fantasy V is a fantasy role-playing video game developed and published by Square in 1992 as a part of the FINAL FANTASY series. The game first appeared only in Japan on Nintendo\u0027s Super Famicom (known internationally as the Super Nintendo Entertainment System).\n\nIt has been ported with minor differences to Sony\u0027s PlayStation and Nintendo\u0027s Game Boy Advance. An original video animation produced in 1994 called FINAL FANTASY: Legend of the Crystals serves as a sequel to the events depicted in the game. It was released for the PlayStation Network on April 6, 2011, in Japan. An enhanced port of the game, with new high-resolution graphics and a touch-based interface, was released for iPhone and iPad on March 28, 2013, and for Android on September 25, 2013.\n\nFINAL FANTASY V has been praised for the freedom of customization that the player has over the characters, achieved through the greatly expanded Job System. Despite being released only in Japan, the Super Famicom version sold more than two million copies. The PlayStation version has earned \"Greatest Hits\" status, selling more than 350,000 copies.",

The sequel updates the graphics, but keeps much of the original gameplay the same.\n\nYou start with an open field and must build it up into a zoo. Create exhibits and populate them with animals. Build amenities and concession stands to keep visitors happy in between exhibits. Happy visitors will donate more money to your zoo so you can make it better. However, you have much more freedom in exhibit creation. You don\u0027t even need fences; a moat or ditch will suffice, as this technique is popular at real high profile zoos. There are also more animals and attractions to place in your zoo, and animal habitats look as realistic as the cartoony graphics style will allow.",

Upon entering the Professor\u0027s vast manor home retrofitted with crazy technology to test his latest hypotheses, players quickly realize their uncle has gone missing. Fortunately, players soon gain access to Professor Quadwrangle\u0027s latest invention, the Inter-Dimensional Shift Device, which, at the press of a button, will shift the world around them to an entirely new dimension. In order to find him, players must use the newly found IDS Device to dynamically change the world to and from a variety of different dimensions to progress through the complicated Quadwrangle Manor. While on the journey, becoming adept at utilizing the various dimensions will help them trek from one bizarre and challenging room to the next. It might sound easy enough, but it is a tall order for a kid in a giant puzzle of a manor!",

    "summary": "Aliens versus Predator offers three separate campaigns, each playable as a separate species: Alien, Predator, or human Colonial Marine. Each player character has different objectives, abilities, and weapons. The single-player campaign presents the player with a conventional series of levels to progress through that are designed around the abilities of each character.\n\nAs the Colonial Marine the player uses a number of weapons to combat Aliens and Predators. The marine wears armor for protection and uses an image intensifier and flares to improve visibility in dark areas.\n\nWhen playing as the Predator the player uses a variety of weapons from the Predator films such as wrist blades, a throwing disc, and shoulder-mounted energy weapons. The Predator is the most durable of the three player characters and can survive falls from greater heights than the human. The player can use a cloaking device to become invisible and several different modes of vision to detect enemies, including an infrared vision mode and a mode sensitive to electrical systems.\n\nAs an Alien the player can explore most of the game\u0027s environments freely, even climbing across walls and ceilings. The Alien has no weapons, however, using its claws, tail, and jaws to attack enemies. The screen is distorted into a fish eye lens effect to reflect the Alien\u0027s field of view. The player can also use a form of echolocation in dark areas and can detect pheromones to discern human or Predator enemies. The Alien can drop from any height without injury and is the fastest of the three player characters.\n\nSeveral bonus levels allow each player character access to portions of the missions of the other characters. To allow the marine and Predator characters to traverse through the areas of the Alien missions, the player is supplied with a jet pack for the marine and a grappling hook for the Predator.",

When you pass the first level, you\u0027ll have three other levels to defeat. Beating all four levels unlocks new lures and grants access to the Extra option. \n \nThe second play mode in Action Bass is the Free mode, where you can freely fish in any of the four available areas and hone your fishing skills. Here you can discover the best spots to catch the bigger fish in less time in preparation for the Challenge mode. You also have the option of saving your fish for the Aquarium, the third mode in Action Bass, where the fish you caught in the Free mode can be viewed by moving in all directions around the fish.",

You take his role and fly an advanced fighter craft to destroy Medtech.\n\nTo survive, you must master an arsenal of weapons including the Molnia Arc, Vortex Shield, and Micro Missiles. But be warned, your opposition is armed to the teeth and will attack without mercy. Regarding gameplay the game is similar to Descent: Flying a ship in first person perspective while shooting enemies. The 24 levels are mostly not the typical narrow mazes but relatively open and offer varied mission goals like protecting convoys, performing covert extractions or executing strikers on strategic targets.",

It is the semi-sequel to 2009\u0027s Wolfenstein, however utilizes very little from the game and drops any direct references to veil or supernatural.\n\nTo progress through the story, the player battle enemies throughout levels. The game utilizes a health system in which players\u0027 health is divided into separate sections that regenerate; if an entire section is lost, the player must use a health pack to replenish the missing health. In combat, a cover system can be used as assistance against enemies. The player have the ability to lean around, over, and under cover, which can be used as a tactical advantage during shootouts and stealth levels. The game gives the player a wide variety of weapon options—they can be found on the ground, retrieved from dead enemies, or removed from their stationary position and carried around.",

Your team, as well as your opponents, are taken from all over Europe and other countries. If you\u0027re interested in reaching supreme glory at a quicker pace, there is an option for cup battle. Like it implies, you\u0027ll have to beat a certain number of teams in tournament fashion to claim your prize. \n \nThe game can be played two different ways, arcade or simulation. By choosing the arcade mode, you won\u0027t have to worry about soccer physics or penalties whereas the simulation goes by actual soccer rules. If you lay into someone\u0027s shin, you\u0027ll probably get called for a penalty. Depending on the severity of the penalty, the game will switch to a penalty shot mode, just like real soccer.",

All of this combines to make the game feel like a live broadcast. \n \nIf realism is not what you are looking for, or if the refs keep rewarding your play with red cards, then switch from the Simulation mode to Arcade mode. With fewer rules and faster play, Arcade mode creates a wide-open game with lots of scoring.

The team was only given ten months to finish the game, a relatively short time for a non-sequel console game (especially in 2005), as it had to be out in time for the movie\u0027s theatrical premier. Still, Terminal Reality rose to the task and managed to create a complete Æon Flux game in less than a year, due in part to the fact that the developer created much of the game using an engine they had already built for their previous title, BloodRayne 2, which cut down on development time dramatically. Nine years after the first ill-fated attempt and five years after the second, an Æon Flux game was finally completed and released to the market in November 2005.",

Open up your afterlife with the Pearly Gates of Heaven or the Fiery Gates of Hell, zone for the Seven Deadly Sins and/or their respective Virtues. Then lay down some roads. Soon, the dearly departed arrive in droves. Keep them in your afterlife and you flourish.

Players can climb into the cockpit of an F-14 Super Tomcat, an F-15E Strike Eagle, or an F/A-19E Super Hornet and speed through the skies, dodging planes, rockets, and bullets while try to target and take down as many enemies as possible. A branching storyline and time limits force gamers into split-second decisions, but once the \"Climax Gauge\" is full, time slows down momentarily to let pilots unleash a screen-clearing fusillade of bullets.\n\nThe game was delisted on PlayStation Network and Xbox Live Arcade in December 2014. The mobile versions followed suit, being delisted in May 2015. In April 2019, the mobile versions were relisted as free games containing ads as apart of the Sega Forever line, before being delisted once again at an unknown date.",

    "summary": "The Candy Land computer game is a version of the classic board game brought to life and enhanced. \n \nOne player can play against a computer opponent, or up to 4 people can take turns. To advance, a player clicks on a machine which produces a piece of colored candy. The player is allowed to move to the next space that shares the same color as the candy which was just drawn. Some spaces are sticky and if a player lands on one, they will lose one or more turns. Some pieces contain special candies which will cause a player to warp to different areas on the board, which may be either ahead or behind of the player\u0027s current space. \n \nIn addition to playing the classic board game, this game offers the player side trips to explore 8 different areas, each with fun activities: \n \nGingerbread Plum Trees: Help Plumpy (the last of the Plumpa trolls) collect plums for pies. Do this by clicking on him to tickle him so he\u0027ll surrender a plum. \n \nLicorice Castle: Lord Licorice has a telescope mounted atop his castle through which you can view the whole of Candy Land. \n \nPeppermint Forest: Mr. Mint, the royal lumberjack, tutors you in how to make freeform music on a hodgepodge of instruments. \n \nGumdrop Mountains: Jolly, the official Gumdrop Mountain Greeter, enlists your help to restore color to the Gumdrop Mountains. Do this by selecting gumdrop colors that Jolly can place in his spoon-shaped catapult to launch toward the mountain. \n \nPeanut Brittle House: Help Grandma Nut grow candy by planting seeds of chocolate chips, caramel chunks, etc. in mounds and watering them. Also, help her redecorate her house. \n \nLollipop Woods: Princess Lolly offers the opportunity to help decorate lollipops with designs that come from a coloring machine that the player can control. \n \nIce Cream Sea: Create an enormous ice cream sundae and then request that the fairy set it adrift on the ice cream sea to be devoured wholesale by a whale. \n \nMolasses Swamp: Gloppy, the curator of the swamp, is just happy to see the player. Children will have fun interacting with the surroundings.",

    "summary": "Alien Storm is a side-scrolling beat \u0027em up. The game resembles Golden Axe, with a similar artistic style, three playable characters (a man, a woman, and a novelty character) and pick-up or power-up special attacks. The player (one player only on the Master System version, up to two players on the Mega Drive version, three on the arcade version) selects from the three different characters to embark upon a quest to save the Earth from an alien invasion.\n\nAll of the Busters are playable from the beginning of the game. There are 6 missions to complete (8 in the Mega Drive version) with several stages, and each mission has the player blasting aliens, from the streets to the mother ship, where the mother of all aliens can be found. This task becomes increasingly difficult with each new mission, and the aliens are capable of hiding inside objects such as plants, postboxes, trashcans, drums, and other items. Each mission has an objective such as rescuing people or destroying an UFO.\n\nWhen dealing with a few aliens, flying heads will appear, which can be shot to collect life or energy. Energy is used specifically to power the energy based attacks of the player\u0027s weapon (such as flames or electricity) and to use the much more powerful special weapons.\n\nIn a similar format as other early Sega arcade games, each character has unlimited usage of various short-range attacks, i.e. punches, kicks. Along with these standard attacks, each character has their own individual weapon (Garth\u0027s weapon that shoots lightning is replaced with a flame weapon in the Master System version). Special attacks are also included, and vary depending on the character chosen at the start of the game. For instance, Garth summons an U.S. Air Force starship that drops bombs across the street (in the Master System version he has Karen\u0027s special, a ballistic missile strike). Scooter will teleport out of his present location and leave a series of bombs that will blow up on the appearance of aliens, after which he will re-appear (in the Mega Drive version he just explodes, leaving his head, which his new body returns to retrieve). Karen calls down a nuclear missile, which incinerates every foe on the screen. However, a large amount of energy is depleted by using each character\u0027s special attack, and cannot be used if the energy of the player\u0027s character is too low.\n\nThere are few bosses in the game. The arcade original only features a single boss that has three distinct forms. The Mega Drive port has two of these forms as two separate bosses. At the end of each mission, the side-scrolling gameplay shifts to either a shooting gallery perspective where the player must take out the aliens that pop out of various locations, similar to the bonus stages of Shinobi and Shadow Dancer, both also by Sega, or a running section that is similar to the side scrolling mode but plays like a horizontal shooter instead with projectile weapons.",

A week ago, a brash female reporter named Valerie had offered him an incredible sum of cash to take her to this unspoiled paradise. Shortly after docking, however, Jack\u0027s boat was greeted by artillery fire from a mysterious militia group swarming about the island.\n\nWith his boat destroyed, his money gone, and the gorgeous Valerie suddenly missing, Jack now finds himself facing an army of mercenaries amidst the wilds of the island, with nothing but a gun and his wits to survive. But the further he pushes into the lush jungle canopy, the stranger things become.\n\nJack encounters an insider within the militia group who reveals the horrific details of the mercenaries\u0027 true intentions. He presents Jack with an unsettling choice: battle the deadliest mercenaries, or condemn the human race to a maniac\u0027s insidious agenda.",

    "summary": "Alfa Romeo Racing Italiano, known in Europe as SCAR, is a Gran Turismo-style racing game. It is similar to the Gran Turismo series except for the role-playing game elements. The game was lauded for having artificial intelligence superior to Gran Turismo 4. When compared to Gran Turismo 4, Alfa Romeo Racing Italiano has far fewer cars and tracks. All the cars in the game are manufactured by the Alfa Romeo motor company. While most of the tracks are in Italy, a few are in other countries like Germany and the United States. A distinguishing feature of the game is that it models driver development using a system almost identical to a role-playing video game. In addition, cars get damaged, both visibly and in performance, by collisions or by driving off course.",

Bunting is more unique, though. Instead of aiming the cursor when you go to bunt, a large arrow points on the ground. Aim your bunt in the desired direction and hope for the best.

Jaffar locks her in a tower and orders her, under threat of execution, to become his wife. The game\u0027s nameless protagonist, whom the Princess loves, is thrown into the palace dungeons. The player must lead the protagonist out of the dungeons and to the palace tower, defeating Jaffar and freeing the Princess in under 60 minutes. In addition to guards, various traps and dungeons, the protagonist is further hindered by his own doppelgänger, an apparition of his own self that is conjured out of a magic mirror.",

The mines must be provided with food and the raw materials must be melted in a foundry.\n\nThe food supply is ensured by the fishermen and the farmers, but they need tools, as do all other workers.

But suddenly you receive a call for help from a friend of yours, Ted Striker. Little Grace Saunders, who was kidnapped a few days ago, is almost certainly being held hostage in an old Californian mansion: \"Hell\u0027s Kitchen\"\n\nWhat\u0027s more, this massive building is the property of the leader of a gang of bootleggers... His name? One Eyed Jack. A word of advice, then: If you are planning on staying alive in this sort of environment, make sure you\u0027ve got your 38 Special, and get hold of a machine gun as soon as possible... So good luck, you\u0027re on your own, ALONE IN THE DARK!",

You play a single fighter type character. Swordplay is enhanced to a semi-arcade level with an ability to learn up to three specific combat moves. \n\nThose combat moves become available as you increase in level and find a trainer willing to teach them to you.

Cities in Caesar III try to accurately reflect the life of Roman citizens: the lowest plebians live in tents and shacks, while the richest patricians live in villas. Staple foods include wheat, fruits, vegetables, and pork, and wine is required for some festivals and houses. Citizens wander the streets in their various garbs and can tell the player their name and how they feel about the city. The city is viewed in a two dimensional isometric view with a fixed magnification level, and can be rotated ninety degrees.\nAccess to services such as market goods, entertainment, hygiene, education, and taxation are represented by \"walkers,\" which are people sent out from their buildings to patrol the streets. Any house that is passed by a walker is considered to have access to the services of the walker\u0027s building. All movements of goods and coverage of walkers are accurately reflected by citizens walking the streets: a player can watch a farm\u0027s crop progress, and when it\u0027s ready a worker will push a full cart from the farm to a nearby warehouse or granary; then return with an empty cart.\nBackground music is played which varies according to the situation (gentle themes to begin with, war drums during times of conflict and triumphal music when the player nears the objective). Musical themes are supplemented by crowd noises, the sounds of manufacturing and the clash of weapons at appropriate times.\nThere are two ways to play the game: Mission Mode, which is tantamount to typical \"campaign\" modes of other strategy games, and City Construction Mode, in which the player plays one scenario from scratch.",

Developed by Irrational Games, the studio behind the original BioShock and BioShock Infinite, this DLC features Rapture as you’ve never seen it before—a shining jewel at the bottom of the ocean, built almost entirely from scratch in the BioShock Infinite engine. The combat experience has been rebalanced and reworked with a greater emphasis on stealth and resource management to give the player a combat experience that merges the best parts of BioShock and BioShock Infinite. It includes a new weapon, an old favorite weapon from the original BioShock as well as the return of the weapon wheel, a new Plasmid, new Gear and Tears.",
