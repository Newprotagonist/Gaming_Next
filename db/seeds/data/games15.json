The covenant which decreed that the gods would respect the free will of mortals was broken by the powerful sun god Ra, who consumed a mortal mind to serve him as champion, leading his armies into war.\n\nThat champion is you; the game begins when you shrug off the mental bondage of Ra, an act so cataclysmic that reality broke, and all of the gods the heavens bore fell to the Earth. The gods are desperate to restore their immortality and regain their place at the zenith of the world. Only you possess the strength of will powerful enough to stop history repeating and end their tyranny once and for all.\n\nCan you make your own miracle and kill the gods?\n\nThere are Six Realms of Magic in BloodRealm: Chaos, Order, Nature, Myth, Shadow and Light.  Each Champion has access to 2 of these Realms in building a deck composed of powerful ally and spell cards. Champions also have a special unique 'Blood' ability, with additional Blood powers unlocked as they Ascend to become Gods themselves.  \n\nThe free download of BloodRealm provides each player with the choice of one of three Champions, its starting Deck of Ally and Spell cards, 1000 Gold, and 36 single-player Campaign battles (each with 3 levels of difficulty). Additional Champions, single-player Campaigns, and card packs may be purchased using Gold, which may be earned by playing the game or by spending real currency.","tags":[268435468,268435471]},{"id":115357,"name":"ASTRONEST VR","platforms":[{"id":6,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}],"screenshots":[{"id":290251,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc67yj.jpg"},{"id":290252,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc67yk.jpg"},{"id":290253,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc67yl.jpg"},{"id":290254,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc67ym.jpg"},{"id":290255,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc67yn.jpg"}],"summary":"Astronest VR is a VR online tactical shooting game.

The fourth and eight stages differ from the rest by instead being scrolling shoot 'em up rather than the regular platforming gameplay.\n\nThe nerd has an infinite supply of empty beer bottles which can be thrown either forward or in an upwards arc. You can also roll by pressing down, even while jumping, which makes you a smaller target but you can't shoot while rolling. Defeated enemies will sometimes drop exclamation mark items which refills some health, or even more rarely an extra life item. Dying will send you back to the last checkpoint.

Early creatures are pretty basic but they have the capacity for some pretty elaborate behaviors and, to be honest, I am not sure how interesting this could get.","tags":[268435469,268435472,268435488,536870999,536872273,536874083,536875046,536875066,536875378,536875794]},{"id":189831,"cover":{"id":206709,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co4fhx.jpg"},"name":"Crimson Waves on the Emerald Sea","platforms":[{"id":6,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}],"screenshots":[{"id":727000,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scfkyg.jpg"},{"id":727001,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scfkyh.jpg"},{"id":727002,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scfkyi.jpg"},{"id":727003,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scfkyj.jpg"},{"id":727004,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scfkyk.jpg"},{"id":727005,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scfkyl.jpg"},{"id":727006,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scfkym.jpg"},{"id":727007,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scfkyn.jpg"},{"id":727008,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scfkyo.jpg"},{"id":727009,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scfkyp.jpg"}],"summary":"A runaway rich kid and a pickpocketing vagabond work together to solve a decade old unsolved vampire attack.","tags":[1,268435487,268435488]},{"id":181010,"cover":{"id":197385,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co48ax.jpg"},"name":"Electronic Universe","platforms":[{"id":6,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}],"screenshots":[{"id":684729,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sceoc9.jpg"},{"id":684732,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sceocc.jpg"},{"id":684739,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sceocj.jpg"},{"id":684744,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sceoco.jpg"},{"id":684746,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sceocq.jpg"},{"id":684749,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sceoct.jpg"}],"summary":"Prepare yourself to shoot obstacles across a electronic musical game.","tags":[1]},{"id":115512,"cover":{"id":119104,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co2jwg.jpg"},"name":"Pax Romana","platforms":[{"id":6,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}],"screenshots":[{"id":457799,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc9t8n.jpg"},{"id":457800,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc9t8o.jpg"},{"id":457801,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc9t8p.jpg"},{"id":457802,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc9t8q.jpg"},{"id":457803,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc9t8r.jpg"},{"id":457804,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc9t8s.jpg"},{"id":457805,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc9t8t.jpg"},{"id":457806,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc9t8u.jpg"},{"id":457807,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc9t8v.jpg"},{"id":457808,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc9t8w.jpg"}],"summary":"Pax Romana: Romulus is an RPG/Adventure game that takes the mythological story of Romulus and Remus, legendary founders of Rome, on a different fiction.

It was the second title released in On-Line Systems' Hi-Res Adventures series after Mystery House. \n \nWizard and the Princess is a prelude to the King's Quest series in both story and concept (though chronologically set several years before King's Quest V). It was also the first adventure game released with full color graphics. \n \nhe game (according to the backcover (box/folder/manual) of the Atari 400/800 and Apple II original and rerelease versions) takes place in the land of Serenia where King George's daughter Princess Priscilla has been kidnapped by an evil wizard named Harlin. Harlin has held her inside his castle far in the mountains. The King has offered half of his kingdom to anyone brave enough to travel to the Wizard's castle, defeat him and return his daughter. The player assumes the role of a happy wanderer who answers this challenge. \n \nThe re-releases (on Apple II, Atari 400/800, and the C64 port) contained additional plot added to the manual explaining how the wanderer made it to Serenia in the first place; some time long into the future after Harlin had been defeated by the Wanderer, he challenged the player to again repeat the actions leading to his defeat. He boasted of using his magic to change the world creating obstacles for anyone who would challenge him (he moved the desert around the village of Daventry, the northern sea splitting Serenia in two, and Great Mountains in the North on his half of the continent). He turned back the sands of time leaving the adventurer in the desert just outside the village of Serenia. He mocks the hero telling him that he may have been defeated once, but he couldn't be defeated a second time. The princess gives the hero some words of advice and a computer to help him defeat Harlin, and tells him he has become the wanderer (grandfather paradox & bootstrap paradox). The manual story as reprinted was also included with the Roberta Williams Collection (a compilation of games from Roberta Williams) and the King's Quest Collection Series (one of the compilations of King's Quest games). \n \nThe introduction for Adventure of Serenia, explained that the adventurer, with the help of a computer, had magically transported to Serenia to save the Princess.","tags":[268435487,536871059,536871208,536871931,536871939,536871958,536872140,536872293,536872419,536872668,536873192,536873308,536873400,536873454,536875172,536875442,536875699,536876082,536876274,536877593,536879818,536883320]},{"id":50770,"cover":{"id":56072,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/xece1hr1uydoz9o8vw4t.jpg"},"name":"Digital Combat Simulator: Black Shark","platforms":[{"id":6,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}],"summary":"DCS: Black Shark is a simulation of the Russian Ka-50 attack helicopter and is the first simulation module of the Digital Combat Simulator series by The Fighter Collection and Eagle Dynamics.\nDCS: Black Shark can be played as the most realistic combat helicopter simulation ever created for the PC with authentic flight dynamics and systems modeling.

Despite being playable at E3 2004 and still set for launch that fall, Electronic Arts cancelled the project to focus on supporting Ultima Online instead. This also led to EA closing the doors on Origin Systems, the studio behind the Ultima series.","tags":[17,268435468,536871938,536872983,536876252]},{"id":61186,"cover":{"id":41105,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/lykncfa2zg0ehs2foqdf.jpg"},"name":"Phonics Fun with Biff, Chip & Kipper Vol. 2","platforms":[{"id":37,"name":"Nintendo 3DS"}],"screenshots":[{"id":168660,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/xrtykg2vgvbktgs05f59.jpg"},{"id":168661,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/uh85oqnz3ou8kdaynhzl.jpg"},{"id":168662,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/loxp2qgrmglgaidcr1km.jpg"},{"id":168663,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/g10f4hpkoyg1wfyyz9qi.jpg"},{"id":168664,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/dkfyjvhpanicgl7m2dzo.jpg"}],"summary":"Educational 3DS game","tags":[34,536871446,536875243]},{"id":32016,"name":"Off the Record: The Italian Affair Collector's Edition","platforms":[{"id":6,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}],"screenshots":[{"id":51427,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/hx9pvgwtu10guyv1sipa.jpg"},{"id":51428,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/clywpt0gal8m7iskoxg8.jpg"},{"id":51429,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/tvkedz4lgzf5k4ezkiht.jpg"},{"id":51430,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sjmx5hyfq8dpmfqtkbx2.jpg"},{"id":51431,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/bhosw9dasjfgphdba5a0.jpg"}],"summary":"Catch a ‘Foxy’ thief!","tags":[268435487]},{"id":42990,"name":"Agarest: Generations of War Zero - Collector's Edition","platforms":[{"id":9,"name":"PlayStation 3"}],"screenshots":[{"id":108708,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/mtwystx2sglwmz9uvszx.jpg"}],"summary":"In a time long forgotten, the gods of darkness and light fought in a savage battle across generations, ravaging the land they had created.

Mankind has colonized the solar system and two political entities have emerged: the Alliance consisting of American, Australian, French, Spanish, Italian, Japanese, British and German forces, and The Coalition of Russian, Chinese and Middle-Eastern interests. The game begins with a surprise attack on Fort Kennedy, where a peace treaty turns into a bloodbath: all of the inner four planets are overrun, including Terra herself, and the Italian and French fleets are utterly lost. The Alliance fleet regroups at Triton, Neptune's moon, and attempts to regain lost territory. The player takes the role of a rookie pilot in the international 45th Volunteers squadron, under the command of Captain Robert Foster and Wing Commander Maria Enriquez, aboard the re-commissioned British carrier ANS Reliant.\n\nAs with Wing Commander: Prophecy, the pilot's flying ability is the only meter by which success and failure is measured, though Starlancer does not feature as many branching mission paths. As in Wing Commander I the pilot may be promoted throughout the course of the campaign; unlike WCI, their rank determines which fighters and missiles they may choose to employ during each mission. The game provides a \"virtual carrier\" through which to navigate, including nearby crewmembers whose reaction to you depends on your current rank and standing. However, the true gem of the game lies in its textual and video news broadcasts, which keep the player informed as to the status of the rest of the war, which seems to be progressing just over the horizon. Players frequently find themselves flying alongside squadrons and pilots they have heard about on the news just recently, providing a dose of 'celebrity exposure' and also increasing the sensation that they are just one part of a much larger war effort.\n\nStarlancer's story is continued in Chris Roberts' Freelancer project, though the two belong to different subgenres (the first is purely focused on action, the latter also features trading and the player can freely move through the game's universe when they are not on a mission.)","tags":[1,18,268435469,536870935,536870936,536871475,536871859,536871882,536872019,536872060,536875061,536875257,536875271,536875296,536875688,536876507,536876857,536876973,536878579,536880260,536880542],"videos":[{"id":4498,"video_id":"pB0tatroMbU"}]},{"id":173089,"cover":{"id":182960,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co3x68.jpg"},"name":"Vengeance is Mine","platforms":[{"id":6,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"},{"id":167,"name":"PlayStation 5"},{"id":169,"name":"Xbox Series X|S"}],"summary":"Vengeance Is Mine’s, brutal melee mech combat is augmented with a time-manipulation mechanic that adds a fascinating twist to encounters.

The game was released as a largely unfinished product and many parts of it do not work properly at all. \n \nThe packaging of Big Rigs states that the main objective of the game is to race a semi-trailer truck (known colloquially as a \"big rig\") in order to safely deliver illegal cargo being carried by the vehicle, while avoiding the local police force. In actuality, there are no police in the game, no such objectives are presented within the game itself and there is no load attached to the truck.[1] Much of the game instead centers on the player racing their truck against fellow drivers to the finish line; however, in the earlier versions the player's computer-controlled opponent vehicles have no AI and never move from the starting position. In a later version, the computer-controlled opponent will race around the track, but will stop just before crossing the finish line. The timer in the game is merely aesthetic and has no limit on the gameplay. In addition, due to a lack of collision detection, there are no obstacles to navigate within the game, and the player is able to phase through environments and leave the game altogether. \n \nBig Rigs: Over the Road Racing was critically panned. The game's criticism is largely directed at its \"blatantly unfinished\"[2] state: lack of collision detection and frequent violation of the laws of physics, frequent and major software bugs, poor visuals, and severe lack of functionality. As a result, the game is now widely regarded as one of the worst video games of all time","tags":[1,268435466,536871317,536871931,536872107,536872192,536872695,536873362,536874115,536874706,536875064,536875069,536875089,536875151,536875154,536875261,536875271,536875488,536875545,536875743,536875822,536876419,536876542,536876576,536876616,536877101,536877517,536877619,536878228,536879989,536881998,536884420],"videos":[{"id":2780,"video_id":"z1mASlkurOE"}]},{"id":4061,"cover":{"id":111427,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co2dz7.jpg"},"name":"Pac-Man Fever","platforms":[{"id":8,"name":"PlayStation 2"},{"id":21,"name":"Nintendo GameCube"}],"summary":"Pac-Man Fever is a 1982 concept album recorded by Buckner & Garcia. It is also the name of the first song on that album. Each song on the album is about a different classic arcade game, and uses sound effects from that game. The album was released as an LP, a cassette, an 8-track tape, and later completely re-recorded for CD release in 1999 and 2002. The title itself is a parody of “Cat Scratch Fever” by Ted Nugent.[2] \n \nThe title song, \"Pac-Man Fever\", was released as a single in December 1981 and became a top-ten hit, peaking at #9 in March 1982 on the Billboard Hot 100[3] and earning Gold certification by the RIAA for selling over a million records;[4] the single sold 2.5 million copies in total as of 2008.[5] It had been released independently earlier in the year on the BGO Records label, before being picked up by CBS. \"Do the Donkey Kong\" was the second single released from the album, but it failed to chart except on Billboard's Bubbling Under Hot 100 Singles at #103. Like the title song, the album Pac-Man Fever itself went on to receive a Gold certification from the RIAA, for over 500,000 records sold;[6] the album sold 900,000 copies in total by the end of 1982.

The player controls Hiryu himself, whose main weapon is a tonfa-like plasma sword known as \"Cypher\". He can perform numerous acrobatic feats depending on the joystick/button combination used. Pressing the jump button while Hiryu is standing still will cause him to do a regular vertical jump, while pressing the jump button while pushing the joystick left or right will enable him to do a cartwheel jump. Hiryu can also slide under or through certain obstacles and enemies by first crouching down and then pressing the jump button. As well as his sliding move, both jumps can also be used to destroy weaker opponents. Hiryu is able to latch onto certain platforms, and climb across walls and ceilings using a metallic hook. While running down a sloped surface, Hiryu can gain enough momentum to allow him to do a longer cartwheel jump than usual. \n \nNumerous power-ups can be obtained from item boxes carried by certain enemies. These includes an extension to Hiryu's attack range that lasts for one hundred slashes, two types of health aids (represented by the kanji used to write Hiryu's name: 飛 and 飛竜), a max health extension (represented by the kanji 竜, the second character in Hiryu's name), an extra life, and a power-up that not only makes Hiryu invulnerable to attack but also increases his own attack abilities via shadow images of himself for 15 seconds.[3] Hiryu can also summon robotic companions known collectively as \"options\" that help him fight enemies. These consist of up to two mushroom-like droids, a saber-toothed tiger and a hawk, known individually as Option A, B and C respectively. \n \nThe game has five stages: the Kazakh Soviet Socialist Republic (called \"St. Petersburg\" during the arcade game's attract sequence), the Siberian Wilderness, the Aerial Battleship Balrog (געלראב), the Amazonian Jungle, and the Grandmaster's lair itself, the Third Moon. Each of the stages is divided into a number of smaller sections, each with their own time limit and checkpoint location. The player has a three-point health gauge (which can be increased to five points with the health extensions. Hiryu will lose a life when either his health gauge is fully depleted, by moving him off the screen entirely (like falling into a bottomless pit) or when the game's timer reaches zero. It's Game Over when all of Hiryu's lives are lost, but the player can be given the opportunity to continue.","tags":[1,18,268435464,268435489],"videos":[{"id":38861,"video_id":"dumAeg4FrRE"}]},{"id":10475,"cover":{"id":48691,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/posngflqim0vpkzwxjvg.jpg"},"name":"Jewel Quest Solitaire 1","platforms":[{"id":20,"name":"Nintendo DS"}],"screenshots":[{"id":162348,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/h7ocpgpy6hp5hhmvfoqw.jpg"},{"id":162349,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/dsmzq6dkocxwxohjvkup.jpg"},{"id":162350,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/vu3zchnduizi5y9tlpkj.jpg"},{"id":162351,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/fjsnobij0gr48wepmv4m.jpg"},{"id":162352,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/kxcgq1w7g0tmyjck888t.jpg"},{"id":162353,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/humnibsrzvg7fyiqayxd.jpg"},{"id":162354,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/zxpbpdq2s5h791ihhvph.jpg"},{"id":162355,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/cmaiikzfjeqkskjjqr9k.jpg"}],"summary":"Play Tripeaks Solitaire in a new way using jewel-themed decks.

A handful of colonists struck out on their own to begin anew - far away from the Earth and its turmoil. Several ships were launched with enough equipment and supplies to give the hundreds onboard a fighting chance - but since the area around far-off Sirius had never been surveyed, no one really knew what to expect. What they found was a new frontier of free-flowing natural resources, unexplored territories, great wonders and lurking dangers. Each ship, representing the clusters of people and their earthly place of origin, settled into different parts of the galaxy pre-selected by their ship-board computer to give them the best chance of survival.\n\nLife was hard in the beginning, but over the 800 years the different colonies prospered and expanded their territories, claiming more and more systems for their own. Survival and propagation eventually led to growth and profit as each of the colonies developed specialties and fostered commerce. As the colonies grew and time passed their connections with their roots on Earth dwindled and they lost their memories of the conflicts of the past. Soon their attention was dominated by new, more immediate conflicts. Feelings of lost ancestral connection spurred anachronism in the look of the great cities, and created a somewhat distorted image of each colony's cultural heritage. In the ever-expanding outer edge of the territories, frontier lawlessness prevailed.\n\nThe Houses: Each shipboard colony that left Earth carried some memory of its origins in its name. The Liberty carried Americans, The Bretonia flew from The United Kingdom and surrounding territory, The Kusari from Asia, and the Rheinland launched with Germanic cargo.\n\nAs each ship settled and colonies began to expand, they knew little about each other and their advancing development. Finally, little by little, the individual colonies found each other and began to set up trade routes to link their systems for commerce and solidarity.\n\nToday, with each colony firmly rooted in its respective corner of the galaxy, the colonies rely heavily on each other for trade and industry but also compete for resources and new territories in the Border Worlds. The colonies mandate member governments in \"The New Alliance\" within the Sirius sector. To control conflicts, each colony has forged alliances and treaties with others as they have grown. Competition remains fierce, however. Struggles rage for supremacy in business, commerce, resources, power and control. There can be tenuous peace between colonies' political agendas, but the grabs for holdings constantly unsettle the volatile frontier.","tags":[18,33,268435461,268435469,268435487,536870915,536870935,536870936,536871009,536871033,536871113,536871859,536871882,536871937,536871938,536871970,536872060,536872129,536872552,536873066,536873874,536874140,536875064,536875133,536875246,536875271,536875453,536875455,536875539,536875796,536875804,536875910,536876857,536876973,536877142,536877216,536877275,536878579,536879734,536880086,536882483,536883035,536884029,536884031],"videos":[{"id":42338,"video_id":"BWr-yy7RCco"}]},{"id":98174,"cover":{"id":110894,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co2dke.jpg"},"name":"The Cross Formula","platforms":[{"id":6,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}],"screenshots":[{"id":393402,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc8fju.jpg"},{"id":393403,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc8fjv.jpg"},{"id":393404,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc8fjw.jpg"}],"summary":"The Cross Formula is a first-person \"lite\" adventure.

Maxwell than its predecessor. Time travelling to the far end of the known galaxy by a malfunction of his hyperdrive, the reckless fighter pilot soon finds himself in mine station, headed by Gunant Breh. The mining station is in the orbit of Var Hastra, a planet in a star system he has never heard of. Soon, he learns that he has missed quite a lot... not only has a new faction, the freethinking Mido Confederation founded by Nivellian and Terran runaways and rebels, emerged in the meantime, but also has a new threat started to wreak havoc among all inhabitants of the universe. Coming out of nowhere and launching devastating raids on convoys and freight ships of all factions, the mysterious Voids are about to make the whole galaxy tremble with fear and put the unstable peace among the different alien races to the test. With the help of the clandestine Deep Science society, an equally secretive and progressive union of ingenious scientists led by the beautiful Dr. Carla Paolini, Keith turns against the seemingly unstoppable alien menace and ultimately sets out to face the Voids in their own home world and end their reign of terror once and for all. During this advanture Keith meets his other old comrades, and also has the potential to have his own space station, in the orbit of Planet Kaamo.","tags":[1,18,38,268435461,268435469,268435488,536870936,536870968,536871077,536871886,536871904,536871945,536872110,536875423,536876569]},{"id":33117,"cover":{"id":93186,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co1zwi.jpg"},"name":"ABE VR","platforms":[{"id":6,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}],"screenshots":[{"id":57424,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/qoiotao6bldnmrb8luf2.jpg"},{"id":57425,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/t52vhekzuskimvgkt1ne.jpg"},{"id":57426,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/selscn2jsm3sev2la1ji.jpg"},{"id":57427,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/hdx50tcpvkek66goybt6.jpg"},{"id":57428,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/z3lmpbf8chp8qiiwnfep.jpg"}],"summary":"ABE VR is an intense experience that recreates the horrifying story about a misguided robot seeking the unconditional love of humans…at whatever cost.","tags":[18,19,268435487],"videos":[{"id":54835,"video_id":"L6yhRke0kvU"}]},{"id":72473,"cover":{"id":31772,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/uahr3w7qpgztveoczt0r.jpg"},"name":"Vulcan: The Tunisian Campaign","platforms":[{"id":13,"name":"PC DOS"},{"id":16,"name":"Amiga"},{"id":25,"name":"Amstrad CPC"},{"id":26,"name":"ZX Spectrum"},{"id":63,"name":"Atari ST/STE"}],"tags":[22,39,268435472]},{"id":19707,"cover":{"id":41163,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/lq9gjh7jogfczqit5eka.jpg"},"name":"Reflex Point","platforms":[{"id":13,"name":"PC DOS"}],"summary":"An unofficial game set in the Robotech universe.","tags":[1,18,268435461,268435489,536870969,536871882,536872617,536873753,536875151,536876005]},{"id":115637,"cover":{"id":193735,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co45hj.jpg"},"name":"Lovers ' Smiles 2","platforms":[{"id":6,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}],"screenshots":[{"id":290776,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc68d4.jpg"},{"id":290777,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc68d5.jpg"},{"id":290778,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc68d6.jpg"},{"id":290779,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc68d7.jpg"},{"id":290780,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc68d8.jpg"},{"id":290781,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc68d9.jpg"}],"summary":"Casual puzzle where you need to help two lovers to meet each other.

It is a sound work composed with divination and AI, which manifests as both an immersive physical installation and videogame. The core of GLUT is a sound composition made entirely of Hedva’s voice, ranging from its rawest expression of screams, to two AI vocal clones that, in order to trick the surveillance tactics embedded in AI, have been manipulated to sound ever more de-human.\n\nDisturbed that proprietary vocal-clone software services reserve the right to sell client voice data to governments and corporations, Hedva worked with artist, musician, technologist, and writer Jessika Khazrik to deceive the software, training it with Hedva’s voice disguised through multiple vocoding processes. Hedva and Khazrik created two vocal clones: Arid and Mud, neither of which are made from an actual human voice and therefore not actual vocal clones. In GLUT, these two AI voices speak a text corpus that Hedva built over four lunar cycles, and synthesized through various divination techniques. The corpus is composed of the writings of medieval mystics (mostly of the apophatic tradition); theoretical physicists, mathematicians, and philosophers writing about black holes, dark matter, night, and nothingness; poets and novelists on sleep, music, and the voice; and the algorithm of amazon.com.\n\nIn the game, users are a teratoma avatar that drags itself through an environment cheating at non-Euclidean geometry through a series of nesting black holes, intestinal tunnels, glittering caves, and oceans of black water. It is a digital experience that mirrors the physical installation (shown at the HKW Berlin) while producing a world that disorients as much as it confirms what knowledges are available to the body.","tags":[19,268435488],"videos":[{"id":64310,"video_id":"alAekHsSiOg"},{"id":64311,"video_id":"qpHTwThsSyY"},{"id":64312,"video_id":"4UZRKhZ44Ow"}]},{"id":69989,"cover":{"id":67495,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/tjgwmi6rxsetrcxos5re.jpg"},"name":"Nile: Passage to Egypt","platforms":[{"id":6,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"},{"id":14,"name":"Mac"}],"screenshots":[{"id":239314,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/jhytjw47nuhpuxhjjg1s.jpg"},{"id":239315,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/md4buqoa87ry5gu2ulho.jpg"},{"id":239316,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/wu3mqgdfgwajpxstb7bo.jpg"}],"summary":"Players undertake an interactive journey down the Nile River through modern and ancient Egypt on an Egyptian sailing boat called a felucca.
