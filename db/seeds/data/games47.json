With the demonic entity released upon the island, the players must find a way to send it back to hell or end up slaughtered. \n \nNever knowing which one of them has become possessed by the demon, it is their decision to make on if they want to team up and trust each other or try surviving alone. \n \nThe humans are played in the first-person mode. In order to exorcise the demon, they need to find the missing ritual components and bring them back to the alter. Their only alternative is hiding and surviving until the dawn, when the sunlight will purge the demon from the grounds. They can use fire, which hurts the demon, or weapons and tools hidden around the island to their advantage. While the demon can’t be killed, he can be crippled, stalled and distracted. \nThe demon is played in the third person, needs to simply slaughter all the humans and prevent them from finishing the ritual. He is fast, agile, powerful and deadly. \n \nThe humans are stronger when they band together, but they are easier to find. Stay together or split up to avoid ending up in a group with a demon – it is for you to choose. \n \nWill you go for the missing ritual parts, or just try to hide until dawn? Will you help the others, or just be a lone wolf – the game leaves that up to you. \n \nWhen a player dies in the game, their soul gets separated from their body and they can float around the map in the shape of a glowing ball of light. He can light the way for the players, find the demon and follow him so the others can see where he is, or just lead the others to his body so they can be revived. \n \nDaemonical also features a positional voice chat, so you can tell the other players that are close to you your plan, or pick a strategy together, but be careful!

You maneuver the cook up and down ladders and left and right across floors in order to walk across various parts of giant hamburgers, such as large lettuce, big buns and massive meat patties. After you cross any section of any hamburger, it will drop one level and push any other burger part within that stack down a floor as well. The object of the game is to build all the hamburgers in each stage by dropping all the makings of each burger into completed stacks at the bottom of the screen.\n\nAs you go about your burger building business, Food Foes Mr. Pickle, Mr. Egg and Mr. Hot dog (also known as Frank N. Furter) will chase after you. You can destroy these culinary cutups by trapping them in falling burger parts or by tricking them into walking on a burger part you are in the process of dropping. To freeze the Food Foes, you can sprinkle a dash of pepper on them. You begin the game with a small pepper supply and can pick up additional pepper shakers that appear throughout the levels. You can also pick up bonus points (in the guise of cups and saucers) and extra lives.\n\nUnlike the original BurgerTime, which had less than 10 different non-scrolling screens, BurgerTime Deluxe has seven levels with four stages in each level for a grand total of 28 screens, most of which scroll to some degree. A password feature enables you to return to the beginning of last level you played.

In addition to bringing home the coin-op's \"Project Dragoon\" scenario, another entire mission, \"The Rising Of Gourb,\" is also included. \n \nThis mission allows players to follow up their recent rescue of the Earth with a desperate mission to save another world from the alien menace. Galaxian3 has little or no connection to Namco's Galaxian coin-op classic, and the PlayStation edition is only available as a Japanese import, despite the fact that it did make it to some U.S. arcades. \n \nInspired by the \"walk-in\" theatrical-style arcade game, Galaxian3 is a blast-fest for up to four players.

Everything, from stationary gun platforms on enormous alien command ships to agile fighters, is fair game. Occasionally reactors and other strategic targets must be hit, including one sequence that bears a bit of resemblance to a certain chase through a certain Death Star. \n \nThe complete arcade game is included, along with an original second \"mission\" involving an alien planet that must be saved.","tags":[1,18,268435461,536870915,536870918,536871078,536871219,536871365,536871882,536871904,536871937,536871970,536872352,536872390,536872651,536872696,536873064,536873186,536873874,536875199,536875242,536875271,536875426,536875558,536875610,536875611,536876391,536876923,536876953,536879182,536880256,536880371,536880858],"videos":[{"id":23449,"video_id":"wDWzR8Ik7fY"}]},{"id":4014,"cover":{"id":4238,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/euztkqyjaw6jztbfcetx.jpg"},"name":"Momotaro Dentetsu 11: Black Bombee Shutsugen! no Maki","platforms":[{"id":8,"name":"PlayStation 2"},{"id":21,"name":"Nintendo GameCube"}],"tags":[536871106,536871308,536871589]},{"id":134000,"cover":{"id":101860,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co26lg.jpg"},"name":"Gravitas","platforms":[{"id":3,"name":"Linux"},{"id":6,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"},{"id":14,"name":"Mac"}],"summary":"Gravitas is a physics and Gravity toy.

It only takes about an hour to complete, but it is an interesting tidbit in the King's Field world.","tags":[268435468,536875472]},{"id":135857,"cover":{"id":115475,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co2h3n.jpg"},"name":"Geten no Hana with Yume Akari Collector's Edition","platforms":[{"id":46,"name":"PlayStation Vita"}],"summary":"A Vita port of both Geten no Hana games with new events, new endings and a new afterstory.","tags":[31,44,268435490,536872225,536872849,536888944,536895822],"videos":[{"id":38666,"video_id":"GaurSrClLNU"},{"id":38667,"video_id":"5BCaUvz2lDY"},{"id":38668,"video_id":"nGULabAX2uI"}]},{"id":56623,"cover":{"id":102667,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co277v.jpg"},"name":"仙剑奇侠传四-Chinese Paladin 4","platforms":[{"id":6,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}],"screenshots":[{"id":122630,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/vjxrjkbdtjzexngj6eak.jpg"},{"id":122631,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/os68ujmy7r0lmqavjkdf.jpg"},{"id":122632,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/ufgmi0bchumoayskqo38.jpg"},{"id":122633,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/lqvsi7azbz8ck49gkp0o.jpg"},{"id":122634,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/ozmqv7rl6bido1wxwull.jpg"}],"summary":"《仙剑奇侠传四》是由软星科技（上海）有限公司研发，北京新游时代网络技术有限公司发行代理的角色扮演单机游戏，也是系列单机游戏《仙剑奇侠传》的第五部作品","tags":[268435468]},{"id":87946,"cover":{"id":192473,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co44ih.jpg"},"name":"King of Mazes","platforms":[{"id":6,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}],"screenshots":[{"id":195912,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/utqkvteqiepkn2zoer66.jpg"},{"id":195913,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/rc20auuvbfsx2wv32zbz.jpg"},{"id":195914,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/szb8gekek9pe5fbn0bqa.jpg"},{"id":195915,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/kh8e2w3sglla8g48olib.jpg"},{"id":195916,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/vhs4graopzmzt8x7pmjl.jpg"}],"summary":"“King of Mazes” is an adult comedic harem RPG.

The player can create up to ten characters, from whom up to four members can be present in a party at the same time. Each character is highly customizable, with four different classes/races (fighter, wizard, elf, and dwarf) and over 60 possible jobs/occupations (ranging from clown to exorcist) available for them to perform; each has its own strengths and weaknesses, affecting the seven primary attributes (strength, intelligence, protection, magic resistance, vitality, dexterity, and karma) in different ways, as well as different equipment limitations.\n\nThe player can choose from fifteen different scenarios, or quests, to play through in the order of their choice. The party must battle enemies and perform tasks within the given levels to clear each scenario, before moving onto another scenario of their choice. The player controls the entire party at the same time, with all four members running in a line, jumping in sequence, and attacking in unison. The party members follow behind in a manner similar to the Options in the arcade shooter Gradius (1985). Sorcerian also employs class-based puzzles, such as using a high-strength character to force open doors.\n\nAll the characters have a default starting age of 16. Each time a player begins a new scenario, a year passes by, while additional time passes by in towns as a character goes through training or enchants items. The characters age at different rates depending on their race, with humans reaching old age at 60, dwarves at 100, and elves at 200. Upon reaching old age, for every year that passes, a character can die permanently at a random time. There is also an “Advance Time” to speed up the flow of time. Another new feature of Sorcerian was its episodic format that extended across various expansion packs. Besides the default fifteen scenarios that come with the game, there were a number of additional scenario packs released.

Man has evolved since the wars of old, creating new ways to combat this deadly expanse. Using Steel and Steam, man fights this terror, as well as the monsters that spawn from its touch.\n\nNow covering half the continent of Terra Corpus, the desertís slow and steady hunger is threatening to consume and corrupt all life in the world. Some of the desperate seek out legends of the past: elemental guardians said to sleep inside the planet. Once resurrected, these powerful beings can be controlled, and guided to stop the desert.\n\nThe legends speak of a chosen few who have the ability to tame these elemental beings and reshape the world.\n\nOur story begins with one such person.\n\nSteel & Steam takes the best elements from the fantasy JRPGs of old, such as great stories, awesome characters, and classic monsters, and combines them with a touch of steampunk. Itís like taking Lord of the Rings and mixing in the Wild West.\n\nIt's a game where you, the player, decide how to interact with the game. The classic games usually had a linear, player-focused story moving the game forward. Steel & Steam follows this model, but also gives you the option of moving the story forward through multiple, intertwined story lines. Any character you meet has the potential to affect the end. Will you or will you not save the world? Who you interact with, and how, will affect the way the ending is played out. Whatever happens in one city or town can affect another. These choices give additional life to the world of Steel & Steam.","tags":[17,31,268435468,536871200,536871433,536871818,536874378]},{"id":109400,"name":"Professor Watts Memory Match: Cats","platforms":[{"id":6,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}],"screenshots":[{"id":252971,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/aglcceydwogcdgmb9p4r.jpg"},{"id":252972,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/rmmn2alevvrarnjaute0.jpg"},{"id":252973,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/xetdewt6ypmaf7ohkuwt.jpg"},{"id":252974,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/yelhr0cclc7wuw7igb75.jpg"},{"id":252975,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/p96ac13lm1di4dnwquk0.jpg"}],"summary":"Hello Professor Watts here and I have some research to do on memory skills.

Black holes, asteroid fields, nebulas, cosmic clouds and wormholes as well as alien races make each fleet sortie a perilous affair. \n \nCan you stand up for the challenge?"},{"id":60451,"cover":{"id":93996,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co20j0.jpg"},"name":"Gat Life: Boyfriend Bar","platforms":[{"id":3,"name":"Linux"},{"id":6,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"},{"id":14,"name":"Mac"},{"id":34,"name":"Android"}],"screenshots":[{"id":375050,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc81e2.jpg"},{"id":375051,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc81e3.jpg"},{"id":375052,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc81e4.jpg"}],"summary":"A gay dating sim where the physical aspects of romance are more family friendly.","tags":[27,31,42,268435488,268435490,536871758,536872396,536872412,536875831,536895877,536895878]},{"id":36074,"cover":{"id":57763,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/z7ip8vednsrvybj2fgf5.jpg"},"name":"ORBITOR","platforms":[{"id":6,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}],"screenshots":[{"id":90590,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/zlnsc7vlzd4gzofztaxy.jpg"},{"id":90591,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/joqe36pba6kwfqz7oooi.jpg"},{"id":90592,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/kjqawcrkafcv2tb46apt.jpg"},{"id":90593,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/odh9stwoxfevigh4k7km.jpg"},{"id":90594,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/r73qyiewx5hsqgaguxk2.jpg"}],"summary":"Navigate the mysterious Quantum Nebula and dismantle it's gravity machine piece by piece before it destroys The Galaxy.","tags":[1,268435487,268435488,536875046,536876291]},{"id":153678,"cover":{"id":155536,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co3c0g.jpg"},"name":"Superman Activity Center","platforms":[{"id":6,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}],"summary":"A children's edutainment game featuring various puzzles, and a completely new story mode to keep kids immersed in the world of Superman.","tags":[268435465]},{"id":75266,"name":"Unforgiving Happiness","platforms":[{"id":6,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}],"screenshots":[{"id":132916,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/uxyu2uim6r3bo8xukvvz.jpg"},{"id":132917,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/e94vfxhxchkw1hflgubt.jpg"},{"id":132918,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/mpzfkzq872t9ka86sd9x.jpg"},{"id":132919,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/jytib5nomlfzisk9wuvh.jpg"},{"id":132920,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/ywomx919a0btakp2xwub.jpg"}],"summary":"Connect the batteries and collect the energy while discovering the inspiring story of a hard-working, independent developer and his journey to happiness.","tags":[268435488]},{"id":123854,"cover":{"id":149187,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co3743.jpg"},"name":"MMX: Otherworld Mystery - Expanded Edition","platforms":[{"id":6,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}],"screenshots":[{"id":339157,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc79p1.jpg"},{"id":339158,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc79p2.jpg"},{"id":339159,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc79p3.jpg"},{"id":339160,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc79p4.jpg"},{"id":339161,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc79p5.jpg"}],"summary":"The mystery of the Otherworldly World MMX will open to You through rotation!","tags":[1,268435487]},{"id":7141,"cover":{"id":187760,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co40vk.jpg"},"name":"Screamer 2","platforms":[{"id":6,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"},{"id":13,"name":"PC DOS"},{"id":14,"name":"Mac"}],"screenshots":[{"id":120203,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/feenmfarvvqomfyv38xj.jpg"},{"id":120204,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/ju1my1zf2a0wnzdon4sg.jpg"},{"id":120205,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sjlhfwyyqm6jxfldccmw.jpg"},{"id":120206,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/nfjtsvrxwjwegbfdoj6b.jpg"},{"id":120207,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/oq3vmk1uf9vyzehnt8kd.jpg"}],"summary":"The follow-up to Screamer is an arcade-style racing game.

The game takes place in a darkly fantastical world where grotesque plant life and animals roam and harsh societal customs rule.

Creatures forage, mate, breed and prey on one another, creating a living world. Only by taming the game’s wilds can Sachi hope to unravel the mystery at the heart of Smoke and Sacrifice. \n \nDepicted in a beautiful, hand-painted style, Smoke and Sacrifice’s storybook visuals disguise its brutal story of motherhood and survival. Sachi doesn’t just have to worry about the game’s antagonists - the entire game world poses a threat. Players can alter the behaviour of plant and animal life, but this may also limit the resources Sachi has to craft items from. The deadly smoke also poses unique challenges throughout the game, altering enemy as well as player behaviour.","tags":[1,17,21,38,43,268435468,268435487,268435488,536871335,536872351],"videos":[{"id":18101,"video_id":"0MbS4i7G0co"},{"id":19411,"video_id":"ka0pwLKlsH4"}]},{"id":92263,"cover":{"id":66015,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/wcfw4uoytyloxhj1stqh.jpg"},"name":"Cool Ball","platforms":[{"id":33,"name":"Game Boy"}],"screenshots":[{"id":212877,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/g0uknvpt4qdongm969gr.jpg"}],"summary":"What's a little round guy to do?
