You have to start from the basics that are gathering food and building not just against other players, but against aggressive creatures as well. Team up with your friends, defeat everything and be the most powerful player. \n \nStay alive \n \nYou have essential needs to survive, such as thirst, hunger and keeping the ideal body temperature. If you do not pay attention to only one of these, you will not make it long. You should always ensure a sufficient amount of food. Furthermore, you have to pay a special attention to your clothing. If you wander for a long time, you’ll have to bear in mind that you need to pass through several domes, and you will be exposed to different weather conditions. You should always carry proper clothing with yourself. \n \nCollection of materials and construction \n \nThe house puts pressure on its fundaments, if some of the supporting pillars of the house are destroyed, the whole construction falls apart that is why enhancing buildings is very important. All structures and objects can be painted to personalize your home. The shelter provides protection against the weather conditions for you and your values. By cutting down the trees from the wood and mining metal and other precious ores, you can make huge, multi-storey buildings by using complex, related parts, including ramps, columns, windows, doors, gates, remote control gates, trap doors, generators, wires, all kind of electrical tools, ladders and many other types of batteries. However, you have to be aware that the required materials cannot be found everywhere. Sometimes you need to go to dangerous places for more valuable materials. \n \nLive and let live \n \nYou can find many different creatures and plants in the SpacerX domes. Plants should be watched and studied, some of them can be planted as well, thus providing nourishing and light food. Meanwhile, other plants can produce useful medicine and lethal toxins that you can use for your own goal. You had better be careful with the wildlife as well. Normally, during the day, you will encounter with tamed animals that are easy to hunt down and you can obtain a huge amount of meat and other materials. Nevertheless, the predators of the island emerge at night as well. Depending on their species they may cause minor difficulties or certain death. And do not forget that different kinds of animals dominate in each climate, so do not get overconfident! Be always very careful and prudent. \n \nDevelopment and learning \n \nYou will be able to develop and learn in SpacerX at the same time. Your learning is optimal if you fight, discover and experiment as much as you can. Then you can learn things that help you to build, construct and fight more efficiently, and survive. This allows you to build stronger walls, shoot more accurately or hide in the wild landscape more efficiently. During your development, you are going to learn the method of producing different building blocks, weapons and other objects. You can achieve more advanced tools and building blocks. \n  \nThe mysterious place \n \nDiscover all areas because it’s worth it. Somewhere you can find valuable raw materials and rare tools. But be careful! The wildlife is extremely dangerous, and other players can also hinder your goals. Different areas have their own dangers and rewards. In some places, you can encounter with tunnels leading into hidden caves that can hide fabulous treasures. \n \nOne against everybody \n \nThere are some players who like to play in a team and rule together, and others who want to play and wander on their own. In the mysterious world of SpacerX, you can choose each path. If you are persistent enough, you will definitely be the champion and ruler of the domes. Just be careful to keep this position. \n \nFreedom \n \nThe world of domes is created so that old players cannot have unfair advantages over the new ones. The lonely wolves do not have to be afraid of the huge clans. We have succeeded in doing this by creating the diversified learning and development system. In the game, every decision, game style and direction has its own advantage and disadvantage. If you are on your own and wake up in a world where a huge tribe has been ruling for a while and are well-equipped and battle wise, you do not need to worry all the time to be hunted down by them. If you are clever and brave, you will have a wandering lifestyle. Because of your extraordinary camouflage and your fast speed, they will not be able to get in your way. They only swallow the dust, while you discover the world and collect the most precious treasures. But this was just one example of the infinite possibilities, where you can show what kind of player you really are. \n \nUseful and useless \n \nIn the world of domes, every object, equipment and armour has its own purchase cost, and it is getting worse as the time passes or you use them more frequently. You should pay attention to the good condition of your equipment. You should not wear or buy such an equipment that you do not use very often and prevent you from doing your best. Consider well all you steps.","tags":[1,21,33,268435464,268435468,268435471,268435487,268435488],"videos":[{"id":15571,"video_id":"D6YBofR9VF4"},{"id":15572,"video_id":"HmOTEbE_KZM"}]},{"id":75870,"cover":{"id":97502,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co238e.jpg"},"name":"Cities: Skylines - Premium Edition","platforms":[{"id":49,"name":"Xbox One"}],"screenshots":[{"id":150418,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/hvdkdjqzoaatvfosusxl.jpg"},{"id":150419,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/efjpsc9zvpk2ydgxyfvf.jpg"},{"id":150420,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/gimsd67cqoscral3ywsu.jpg"},{"id":150421,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/q8ubsbgisuffqtwwkyh3.jpg"},{"id":150422,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/yxeuyiu521nkiw2kuuwp.jpg"},{"id":150423,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/vwzobdtwxvxesxc798dm.jpg"},{"id":150424,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/skmhxzmowmmhvpdvjxxp.jpg"},{"id":150425,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/zjhul2jhnuu0lcw4ouz6.jpg"},{"id":150426,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/iznzptwsh0s4jwxexzx6.jpg"},{"id":150427,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/svkcx15r0wvsimbv0pe6.jpg"}],"summary":"Cities: Skylines is a modern take on the classic city simulation genre.

It was intended to be an easier game to solve than the typical Infocom release and provide a good introduction to interactive fiction for inexperienced players, and was very well received. \n \nThe player's character is a postal clerk in the small fishing village of Festeron. The cranky postmaster, Mr. Crisp, orders the player to deliver an important envelope to the proprietor of Ye Olde Magick Shoppe. The proprietor in question, a kindly old lady, then asks the player to rescue her cat from a mysterious sorceress known only as The Evil One. Stepping out of the store, the player finds that quaint Festeron has mysteriously been transformed into a more sinister town called Witchville. There are but a few hours to defeat The Evil One. Fortunately, the player soon finds the Wishbringer, a magical stone that can grant seven wishes if a suitable object is used in conjunction. The seven wishes that can be granted by the stone are for advice, darkness, flight, foresight, freedom, luck, and rain. Each wish can only be used once per game, and requires that the player possess some related object.","tags":[17,22,268435487,536871130,536871208,536871939,536873308,536875172,536878561,536885978,536886008]},{"id":139259,"cover":{"id":116104,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co2hl4.jpg"},"name":"Shambles","platforms":[{"id":6,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}],"screenshots":[{"id":401827,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc8m1v.jpg"},{"id":401828,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc8m1w.jpg"}],"summary":"A free game like Doom, but with Zombies.","tags":[1,268435461,536870917,536887866,536897134]},{"id":55020,"cover":{"id":102974,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co27ge.jpg"},"name":"White Day 2: Swan Song","platforms":[{"id":48,"name":"PlayStation 4"}]},{"id":27366,"cover":{"id":110733,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co2dfx.jpg"},"name":"Ooblets","platforms":[{"id":6,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"},{"id":49,"name":"Xbox One"},{"id":130,"name":"Nintendo Switch"}],"screenshots":[{"id":44338,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/ihkcug5zap0ie96ujhlb.jpg"},{"id":44339,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/afow85yuc7ftxvo5f9k0.jpg"},{"id":44340,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/qsmxj6rh9gufmb6clecb.jpg"},{"id":44341,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/osvd56yunv7kljvw8ubr.jpg"},{"id":44342,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/qb7zzpc5dmsxbnhh2rqh.jpg"},{"id":393263,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc8ffz.jpg"}],"summary":"Ooblets is a currently-in-development creature collection and farming game.

Renowned as the linchpin of civilization and the cultural centre of Europe, Venice was the most important trading post between Western Europe and the eastern stretch of the Mediterranean Sea. It was also the stage for political corruptions and clandestine dealings.\n\nThis is where your story begins. As a young man striving for success, power and wealth and with the support of your family, you begin to build up a trading empire across Genua, Tripoli, Rome, Alexandria and Constantinople in addition to many other significant cities from the Renaissance. As you progress through the ranks of Venetian society, increasing your power with smart trading moves and calling in the occasional favour you can begin to assemble your own fleet. With this you will start to build up new production facilities, test yourself in challenging sea battles where you will face off against pirates as well as political enemies to finally become the Doge of Venice.","tags":[17,22,268435469,268435471,536870916,536871305,536871906,536871911,536872060,536872070,536872071,536872406,536874694,536874916,536875046,536875062,536875067,536876237],"videos":[{"id":5291,"video_id":"SRdm5Pm1MY0"}]},{"id":30057,"name":"Rest In Peace","platforms":[{"id":6,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}],"screenshots":[{"id":70259,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/swrlzfwb9etdtzjwbuan.jpg"},{"id":70260,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/vir0qbnlgwzt88rmxprl.jpg"},{"id":70261,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/hm0ujz5l3mobz0gieltr.jpg"},{"id":70262,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/srmjguqbpymitq9qlkyq.jpg"},{"id":70263,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/bvskpir8fvxvj6ppbn0r.jpg"}],"summary":"Rest In Peace - game in the genre puzzle.

Kya meets (and is saved by) the native creatures of this world (known as the Nativs), however Frank is captured by a dangerous enemy known as the Wolfens under the rule of Brazul. To make matters worse, Kya learns that the Wolfens are actually the peaceful Nativs which have been captured and transformed, and Brazul is actually her long lost father! Kya must now embark on a quest to rescue her brother as well as find a way to restore the Wolfen to their Nativ form and defeat Brazul.\n\nKya: Dark Lineage is an action adventure game. You control Kya and need to explore the colorful world she's arrived in. This strange world consists of various floating islands with many tunnels, platforms, dangerous life forms, and other obstacles. Powerful winds blow around many areas, and you'll often need to use the winds to your advantage by floating in them through tunnels, over gaps or slowing your descent in a free fall. There is some puzzle solving as well; you'll need to locate objects to use, hop on various platforms, buy items in the Nativ city, and more to reach new areas.\n\nYou'll also need to fight often, as the Wolfen are numerous and can found guarding many areas you need to get through. You can fight with your fists as well as items that can be acquired (such as various boomies, or boomerangs, and fighting bracelets). After defeating a Wolfen, you can use a magic spell to transform it back to its Nativ form which will then return back to the Nativ city. Upon returning to the city, many of the Nativs will then open up a shop; as new shops are opened, you will have the opportunity to buy new items and power ups to help on your quest. Alternatively, some Nativs may instead build a challenge in the city instead of opening a shop. You can earn money by betting and completing challenge objectives (or you can simply practice a challenge).\n\nAs you progress through the game, the story will unfold until you are (hopefully) successful in your quest!","tags":[1,268435464,268435465,536870973,536871138,536871208,536871213,536872131,536872690,536872961,536873067,536873590,536875057,536875073,536875095,536875209,536875262,536875358,536875396,536875519,536876298,536876299,536876546,536877579,536878086,536878441,536879808,536880087,536880469,536880575,536881485,536883533,536884027,536885911,536885912,536885913,536885914,536885915,536885916,536885917,536885918,536885919,536885920,536885921,536885922,536885923]},{"id":18913,"cover":{"id":15265,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/vqqyckfzl1dhu95wuavm.jpg"},"name":"Pancake Surprise!","platforms":[{"id":3,"name":"Linux"},{"id":6,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"},{"id":14,"name":"Mac"}],"screenshots":[{"id":22884,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/b5ckcjdagueuajixadoo.jpg"},{"id":22885,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/kh5nrgwcfwjdy6hny5fl.jpg"},{"id":22886,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/y9voepfedfynslnh7czf.jpg"},{"id":22887,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/ucozlqybrps89mjkn4ba.jpg"},{"id":22888,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/ixl8efo2wsgsbyk0prhp.jpg"}],"summary":"Pancake Surprise is a story that is set in Azaliea in the kingdom of Azaliea.

You'll have all of the maps, vehicles, and weaponry you could ever need in order to get the job done, and you'll need all of the help you can get The wilderness never seems to end in this expansive title. If you need some justification to kill animals, you can join forces with the Department of Natural Resources and help to keep the wolf and bear populations in check (just as brutal a process as deer hunting, mind you). There are adjustable skill settings to ensure that gamers of all walks get their money's worth, and you can even select an x-ray option that aids you in lining up your shots by showing you your prey's internal organs.","tags":[1,268435461,268435469,268435470,536870976,536871937,536872060,536872078,536875046,536875078,536875151,536875358,536875483,536875572,536876240,536877501]},{"id":111562,"cover":{"id":120284,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co2kt8.jpg"},"name":"Speed Racer","platforms":[{"id":7,"name":"PlayStation"}],"screenshots":[{"id":258570,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc5jii.jpg"}],"summary":"Speed Racer is an arcade type game that resembles the Sega Saturn's Daytona USA.

However he soon realises once again that nothing goes quite as smoothly as Jack had imagined.\n\nShanghai, 1899 - The mysterious Chinese city is the epicentre for adventurers of all kinds. Jack Keane, too, has been attracted to the place by rumours of a legendary treasure - or to be more precise, these tales have led him right inside the walls of the notorious Shanghai prison. It is within these walls that the guardian of the treasure, a secretive shaman, has been locked up for years. Unfortunately for our hero, Jack has completely disregarded the fact that it is a lot easier to get INTO prison than out of it…\n\nAnd this is only the beginning of Jack Keane's newest bizarre adventure: mysterious treasures, ruthless villains, two distractingly beautiful women and tons of clever humour await the most lovable treasure hunter to have ever sailed the seven seas in a comical tour de force around the globe. During his travels, Jack will not only meet old friends, but also encounter new faces such as the elegant city-lady Eve and the brilliant German engineer Carl.\n\nJack Keane 2 - The Fire Within is set to revolutionise the classic point & click adventure genre. Never has an adventure been as cinematic, fast-paced and humorous, without breaking any of the iconic point & click gameplay rules.\n\nState of the art 3D-graphics, gripping action-sequences and the typical bizarre Jack Keanesque humour will be an absolute delight to all adventure fans.","tags":[268435487]},{"id":48952,"name":"Double Dribble: 5 on 5","platforms":[{"id":33,"name":"Game Boy"}],"summary":"Compared to many sports-related Nintendo games of this era, Double Dribble resembled its sport with surprising accuracy.

Viewed from slightly above and behind the spaceship, the camera scrolls into a 3-D environment in all directions. There are seven levels to negotiate situated above huge crowded cities on earth, earth's oceans, space and on the futuristic world of Morzique. A striking feature is the fighter cannot collide with the backgrounds. This is a good thing, though, as from the word go Morzique spaceships fly into the screen from all directions and fire at you at an alarming rate. Luckily, you have three types of weapon at your disposal: standard fire, three smart bombs, and by holding down the fire- and smart bomb-keys simultaneously, a laser beam. Certain destroyed ships leave behind three types of power-ups: mint-coloured orbs add 10% energy to your energy bar, green orbs gain 100 points and red orbs gain 200 points. Finally, at the end of a level a huge end-of-level boss awaits and needs to be put to rest.","tags":[1,18,268435461,536871078,536871886,536874526]},{"id":31532,"name":"Kubz VR","platforms":[{"id":6,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}],"screenshots":[{"id":48697,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/xhzvjaio4rbxytghrbqa.jpg"},{"id":48698,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/nwofxtpoj9hawlfolqqx.jpg"},{"id":48699,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/zcacjvpgrs50ennaqfuk.jpg"},{"id":48700,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/ngdngga3rtge8clfggrl.jpg"},{"id":48701,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/kgycrds9iag8kec60rsy.jpg"}],"summary":"Kubz brings one of the most famous puzzle game of all time to the Virtual Reality world!  \n \nPlay with an HTC Vive in a 3d rooms with very realistic Tetrominos falling from the sky.

When pressing a button, the symbols are rotated clockwise around the frame. Of course the levels have to be solved within a time limit.\n\nIn the higher difficulty levels, the player also has to deal with so-called special effects which occasionally kick in during play, e.g. some symbols get hidden by \"?\" blocks, symbols rotate on their own or the controls are reversed. Three power-ups can be earned by completing bonus levels or finishing a level really fast: clock (stops time for 20 seconds), flash (skips the current level) and credit (gives a second try after time has run out). Clock and flash have to be activated manually; credits is applied automatically. Besides the regular playing mode, there is also the \"Brain Race\" available which involves solving a certain number of levels (depending on the difficulty) as fast as possible.","tags":[268435465,536873787]},{"id":10,"aggregated_rating":80.0,"cover":{"id":95796,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co21x0.jpg"},"name":"Jade Empire: Special Edition","platforms":[{"id":6,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"},{"id":11,"name":"Xbox"},{"id":12,"name":"Xbox 360"},{"id":14,"name":"Mac"},{"id":34,"name":"Android"},{"id":39,"name":"iOS"}],"screenshots":[{"id":25,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/vtithwow0cy342ihrphs.jpg"},{"id":913,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/gjdvo89xdmrigtqevmsw.jpg"},{"id":914,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/djy4u1gxkwtwbpnnq9ag.jpg"},{"id":915,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/anweqofr6wx9cey82dvu.jpg"},{"id":916,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/pnkbxiadz8zefrq5rpxz.jpg"}],"summary":"Step into the role of an aspiring martial-arts master and follow the path of the open palm or the closed fist.
