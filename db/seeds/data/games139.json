designers of the Bard's Tale series, Wasteland, and Battle Chess pooled their talents to create the ultimate role-playing fantasy. They knew it had to be a first-rate story with sophisticated graphics. The result was Dragon Wars.\n\nSailing across uncharted seas, you and your party are in search of a legendary paradise called Dilmun — a place where the streets are paved with gold and no one wants for anything.\n\nHowever, King Drake of Phoebus has declared all magic illegal - magickers have been slain or fled into exile.

Bodenplatte was the German code word for the bold operation to launch a surprise low-level attack on multiple Allied airfields on Jan 1st, 1945. It contains eight aircraft (additional Collector Planes are available as separate DLCs). \n \nBattle of Bodenplatte puts you at the scene of some of the most important battles on the Western Front as the Allies are knocking on Germany’s door and trying to cross the Rhine River into Germany for the first time. Fly in support of Operation Market Garden, the Battle of the Bulge and Operation Bodenplatte. Try to once and for all destroy the Luftwaffe or try to blunt the Allied advance into Germany. It’s was the peak piston-engine power and the dawn of the jet age, a time when famous Allied aces roamed the sky and desperate German defenders were trying to just survive, now outnumbered and no longer the masters of the air. Fight in aerial engagements over lush, green farmland and dense wooded forests or find yourself twisting and turning over frozen fields and icy rivers of the bitterly cold winter of 1944-45. Do you have the skills to survive the harrowing air combat? \n \nIL-2 Sturmovik: Battle of Bodenplatte adds a new Western front theater to the IL-2 Sturmovik: Great Battles series of products. Steam requires you own Battle of Stalingrad before you can add Battle of Bodenplatte. Combined with Battle of Stalingrad, Battle of Moscow and Battle of Kuban, the series covers the combat pilot experience spanning both Eastern and Western fronts in WWII. Dogfight over the frozen steppes of Russia, the scenic mountains and beaches the Caucasus region or the doorstep of Germany itself. There is not a more monumental combat flight-simulator experience on the market with such a wide range of planes and theaters crafted to this level of detail. The physics, realism, systems, beauty, atmosphere, features, gameplay, performance, history and options combine to set a new standard of playability and fun in this important genre. IL-2 Sturmovik: Great Battles series is not a simply a PC game, it’s an AIR COMBAT SIMULATOR.

It is based upon Atari's Breakout games of the 1970s. The object of the game is to clear levels by either destroying all bricks or defeating the enemies.\nThere are four zones of eleven levels each. The zones are Cubic Zone, Mirror Zone, Tube Zone and Final Zone. This game differs from the original Breakout as it contained enemies on screen that could be hit to gain power ups. Powerups included a parachute to slow the ball down, multiple balls, or projectiles. There were also level warps in the form of \"Konami Man\", who would fly from top to bottom of the play area. There were typically 1 - 3 enemies on screen at once, appearing out of a trapdoor in the top corners, or let in through the side walls. Every few levels there was also a boss, ranging from a small dragon to a centipede. The bosses changed colour from Green to Blue to Pink, each time increasing in speed. Each level also contained a hidden letter which made up a password presented at the end of the game (Zone 4 Level 11).

Worlds can be played by up to two players simultaneously. The player controls a flying muscle-bound soldier armed with a rifle with unlimited ammo. The Player 1 character is equipped with a long-range automatic rifle, while Player 2 has a short-range wide shot. The controls in the original coin-op version consists of an eight-way joystick for moving the character in the air while flying and a unique rotatable button known as the \"roll switch\".Rotating the switch left or right allows the player to adjust their character's aim in one of sixteen directions, while pressing it causes the player character to shoot his gun. This allows for the player to move their character anywhere while keeping their aim in one direction. Pressing the switch rapidly will cause the character to perform a \"megacrush\" attack will destroy all on-screen enemies, but at the expense of a portion of their vitality gauge. \n \nThe player character is accompanied by a satellite module orbiting near him that will provide backup firepower every time the player fires their gun. Like the main character, the satellite can also be rotated with the roll switch. Rotating the character while firing will only rotate the aim of the satellite, while rotating the character without firing will not only rotate the satellite's aim, it will also move its relative position around the player. \n \nThe player can obtain blue-colored coins known as \"zennies\" from defeating enemies throughout the game. The zennies are used as currency to obtain new power-up items from shops located at certain points in each stage. When the player enters an item shop, they are given a choice of the items available and a limited time to make any purchase they wish. These items consists primarily of new weapons for the satellite module, but also includes a health kit to restore lost vitality, an armor that allows the player to sustain additional damage, and even tips on how to defeat the boss awaiting at the end of the current stage. \n \nForgotten Worlds consists of five stages with a total of eight bosses. The player will lose if their vitality gauge runs out, but will be given a chance to continue.","tags":[1,18,268435461,268435489,536870981,536871078,536871882,536874653,536875358,536875434,536876437,536880859,536881365,536884388,536885414],"videos":[{"id":2431,"video_id":"baNlrRMaAJM"}]},{"id":28972,"cover":{"id":84255,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co1t0f.jpg"},"name":"Neverwinter Nights 2: Platinum","platforms":[{"id":6,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}],"screenshots":[{"id":405784,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc8p3s.jpg"},{"id":405785,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc8p3t.jpg"},{"id":405786,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc8p3u.jpg"}],"summary":"Neverwinter Nights 2 Platinum includes Neverwinter Nights 2 and two official expansion packs: Mask of the Betrayer and Storm of Zehir.","tags":[17,268435468,268435487]},{"id":31398,"name":"Brawlderdash","platforms":[{"id":6,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}],"screenshots":[{"id":47887,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/m6dds4jk581dco4pk7w7.jpg"},{"id":47888,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/vw3ksmlx4qc38qohukdv.jpg"},{"id":47889,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/fmjkdxcr3mw9huybdlex.jpg"},{"id":47890,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/xmszsit8cgses9qp4spe.jpg"},{"id":47891,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/wqs7oazbrewhvhlol687.jpg"}],"summary":"Brawlderdash is a local multiplayer sport game and every sport is invited!

She lands on Krazoa Palace after receiving a distress call from Dinosaur Planet, but an unfortunate event occurs during her exploration of this location.\n\nMeanwhile, General Pepper contacts the Star Fox Team and asks them to investigate Dinosaur Planet. One of the main reasons for the investigation, is that large chunks of the planet have become detached for an unexplained reason.\n\nFox McCloud agrees to take a look. On the planet's surface, Fox comes across a magical staff that becomes his sole weapon in the game.\n\nFox learns from the Triceratops Queen of the EarthWalker Tribe that General Scales, a member of a different tribe, has stolen the four Spellstones from the planet's two Force Point Temples, causing the detachment of parts of the planet.\n\nTo prevent the planet from breaking up further and restore it to its original unity, The player must control Fox and restore the Spellstones to the temples. Fox embarks on this quest with the help of the Queen's son, named Prince Tricky, a Triceratops who is approximately the same size as a wolf cub.\n\nFox discovers that he must also retrieve the other five Krazoa Spirits to repair the planet, and save the life of another ally.\n\nIn order for the player to restore the Spellstones and Krazoa spirits, they must navigate through the variety of environments present on Dinosaur Planet, exploring new landscapes, facing new foes and receiving help from new allies that reside there.\n\nPrince Tricky helps in certain situations by using his unique abilities. The player asks Prince Tricky to use these abilities by selecting options from a menu opened with the C-Stick.\n\nAs you navigate through the game, your staff acquires new abilities, which are selected by using the same C-Stick menu.\n\nThere are moments in the game that require the use of the arwing, a type of spacecraft used by the Star Fox team. However, these moments take up under half an hour of the overall game time.\n\nThe game can be described as an Action-Adventure, Open World game that contains strong elements of Fantasy and some elements of Sci-Fi.\n\nIt is often described as being similar to The Ocarina Of Time and the other home console Zelda Games.\n\nWhen engaged with an enemy, the combat is real time, meaning each of Fox's movements in combat require the press of the A button, similar to how each sword swing in Zelda or Skyrim require the press of a button.","tags":[1,17,18,38,268435461,268435465,268435468,268435469,536870968,536870999,536871049,536871138,536871139,536871208,536871213,536871581,536871859,536871882,536871904,536871937,536871938,536871939,536871970,536872010,536872552,536872628,536872798,536872865,536873066,536873096,536873123,536873124,536873125,536873364,536874398,536875073,536875074,536875081,536875088,536875199,536875271,536875308,536875309,536875331,536875437,536875523,536875525,536875573,536875590,536875639,536875644,536875819,536875915,536875934,536876286,536876391,536876584,536876634,536876715,536876732,536876756,536876847,536876943,536876973,536876988,536877230,536877406,536877713,536877755,536878142,536878385,536878391,536879806,536879813,536879840,536880441,536880481,536880500,536880712,536880847,536881401,536881485,536881486,536883082,536884029,536884030,536886146,536886147,536899580],"videos":[{"id":14047,"video_id":"QNeyAmTFJjc"},{"id":14048,"video_id":"K08p_oFvJJI"},{"id":14049,"video_id":"OliAnoALccg"}]},{"id":151124,"cover":{"id":167204,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co3l0k.jpg"},"name":"Zero-G Revolution","platforms":[{"id":6,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}],"screenshots":[{"id":481340,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scabek.jpg"},{"id":481342,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scabem.jpg"},{"id":481343,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scaben.jpg"},{"id":481345,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scabep.jpg"},{"id":481348,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scabes.jpg"}],"summary":"A single player sci-fi Adventure game for VR device.","tags":[268435469,268435487,268435488]},{"id":161811,"cover":{"id":164614,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co3j0m.jpg"},"name":"Microsoft Flight Simulator X: Steam Edition - Piper PA-34-200T Seneca II","platforms":[{"id":6,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}],"screenshots":[{"id":567998,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scc69q.jpg"},{"id":568010,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scc6a2.jpg"},{"id":568024,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scc6ag.jpg"},{"id":568035,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scc6ar.jpg"},{"id":568041,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scc6ax.jpg"},{"id":568047,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scc6b3.jpg"},{"id":568052,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scc6b8.jpg"},{"id":568054,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scc6ba.jpg"}],"summary":"The Piper PA-34 Seneca was first flown in 1969.

Notably, the game was sponsored by Smiths' British snack Quavers (now owned by Walkers), where the game plot revolves around the then Quavers mascot 'Colin Curly' losing his Quavers packets down a giant ant hill. The player is then tasked with controlling 'G.I. Ant', a large soldier ant, to recover the Quavers by solving a series of puzzles. The SNES version lacks the Quavers branding, and instead the aim is to recover bundles of cash dropped down the ant hill by Captain Rat.\n\nThe game consists of 100 levels of increasing complexity over nine different themed worlds. Each level features several interconnected platforms holding a number of \"dominoes\". The aim is to rearrange the dominoes, such that with a single push, all of the dominoes are toppled, thus opening the exit to the next level. There are 11 different types of domino, identified by red and yellow patterns, each with different actions. The player controls G.I. Ant, who can move certain dominoes by carrying them one at a time.\n\nVarious factors can result in failure to complete a level. As well as toppling all of the dominoes, the player must be able to access the exit door once the dominoes have fallen. For instance, the player will be unable to reach the exit if a ledge leading to the exit has been destroyed, or if a gap leading to the exit has not been bridged, or if a line of dominoes lie across the exit. G.I. Ant may die by falling from a large height, by falling off the bottom of the screen, or by being crushed under a falling domino. The player is then greeted with the message \"You Failed, You Died\" and has to restart the level. Also, the level will be failed if any dominoes are destroyed by landing one domino on top of another.\n\nEach level has a time limit during which it must be completed. However, if the time runs out the player is still able to continue with the puzzle if they wish. By pausing the game once the time has run out, a small hint will be displayed, giving advice on how to complete the level. As a side note, the hint for level 98 informs the player that the game's designer cannot remember how to complete the level without trickery (\"Use a drop! There is a way to make it work with a push, but I can't find it!\").\n\nThe themed worlds, in order, are an industrial complex, an Aztec world, a space station, an electronic world, a Greek temple, a Medieval castle, a Meccano-inspired world, a dungeon and a Japanese temple. Each world has 11 levels, making a total of 99 regular levels. A packet of Colin's Quavers is retrieved after each world, with nine packets in all to be collected. Many of the early levels are tutorials demonstrating how each type of domino will act. Often there is only a single solution to each level, though some levels have multiple solutions. The final level, level 100, must be completed using dominoes with hidden markings.\n\nA password system allows the player to continue an earlier game, without having to restart from the first level. Additionally, upon completing a level the player gains a token, which once a level has been failed, allows the player to return to the point before the domino push, rather than having to return to the initial state of the level.","tags":[27,268435464,268435465,268435471,268435487,536871049,536871240,536871262,536871921,536872211,536872961,536873787,536873904,536874943,536875439,536875693,536875727,536876011,536879868],"videos":[{"id":4977,"video_id":"wXHEuQH0q_4"}]},{"id":179206,"cover":{"id":196552,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co47ns.jpg"},"name":"AFK Summoner","platforms":[{"id":6,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}],"screenshots":[{"id":677226,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sceiju.jpg"},{"id":677229,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sceijx.jpg"},{"id":677231,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sceijz.jpg"},{"id":677233,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sceik1.jpg"},{"id":677235,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sceik3.jpg"}],"summary":"AFK Summoner is a strategy RPG with AFK gameplay and various features.

The game featured 100 levels of randomly generated maps, the first ten being the games main story mode. The other 90 were extended play for players wanting to continue playing with their strong characters. \n \nGame play[edit] \nAs the game starts, you create a team of Enforcers for your expeditions into the dungeon, with the option to create over 40 total. When creating your characters you are given the ability to alter height, sex, ethnicity, weight and hair style as well as given a choice between the Fencer, Caster, Analyzer, Striker, or Broader classes; Each falling into a Dungeons and Dragons styled role. Several Advanced classes were available by finding Class Chips in the dungeon and applying them to your characters.

Each level has a control room that could possibly be locked, holding a boss monster that must be defeated to win the level and unlock the next one. \n \nFencer Fighter class that could use Hammers or Swords and had the rare chance of performing a move like a Final Fantasy \"Limit Break\" that would damage all enemies at once. \n \nAnalyzer Ranged class. Without an Analyzer in the party, the player is unable to know how much health enemies have and their current HP amount. Analyzers used firearms ranging from laser beams, to machine guns, to rocket launchers that all shared the same in game model. \n \nCaster Basic Spell Caster that could be wired with a variety of Spell Chips either bought from the in-game shop or found in the dungeon. Each spell had a number of charges that had to be refilled by visiting the surface. Casters automatically blocked until the player told them what spell to use. \n \nBroader The Jack-Of-All-Trades class that had a flat rate for all skill gains at the expense of leveling up extremely slowly and was reserved for advanced players that foresaw spending a large time grinding. \n \nStriker A barbarian class that used combat gloves as their weapon. Each strike had a rare chance of instantly killing a non-boss enemy. \n \nReception[edit] \nMetal Dungeon was rated very poorly for its simple game play, transparent story, and character creation system.
