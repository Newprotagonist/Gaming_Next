The demo for Football Manager 2008 was released on 30 September 2007. \n \nThe game was originally intended to be released on 19 October 2007, but due to early shipments by many retailers carrying their game, Sports Interactive moved the release date to 18 October 2007. \n \nSeveral problems surfaced in the game, most of which had been reported to SI Games via their issues forum, and as a result, a \"Beta Patch\" was released. This patch did not fix all problems but was released early to fix major issues. A full patch was set to be released on 9 November 2007 but was delayed, and was finally released on 22 November 2007. The second and final patch was released on 14 February 2008 and updated on 20 February to attempt to fix three major issues that remained in the game. As with previous games, the patch updates the game's database with all the latest transfers and fixes many of the game's remaining bugs.","tags":[268435469,268435470,268435471,536870938,536870939,536871327,536871906,536872060,536872070,536872078,536872205,536872637,536873715,536874694,536875356,536875431,536875433,536875709,536875763,536875870,536876435,536876565,536876583,536877432,536878090,536878111,536878116,536878118,536878119,536878120,536878121,536878125,536879750,536882270,536882395,536882397,536883266,536884016]},{"id":8971,"aggregated_rating":85.0,"cover":{"id":119487,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co2k73.jpg"},"name":"Football Manager 2006","platforms":[{"id":6,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"},{"id":12,"name":"Xbox 360"},{"id":14,"name":"Mac"},{"id":38,"name":"PlayStation Portable"}],"screenshots":[{"id":635497,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scdmcp.jpg"},{"id":635498,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scdmcq.jpg"},{"id":635499,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scdmcr.jpg"}],"summary":"Football Manager 2006 is the second installment in the Football Manager series by Sports Interactive.

Each level is themed after Nazi bunkers and buildings. To finish a level, the player must traverse through the area to reach an elevator. Levels are grouped together into named episodes, with the final level focusing on a boss fight with a particularly difficult enemy. While traversing the levels, the player must fight Nazi guards and soldiers, dogs, and other enemies while managing supplies of ammunition and health.","tags":[1,17,18,19,22,268435461,536870928,536870931,536871041,536871133,536871213,536871365,536871378,536871470,536871474,536871501,536871506,536871516,536871599,536871882,536871937,536871969,536872009,536872010,536872070,536872201,536872205,536872232,536872234,536872317,536872352,536872810,536872847,536873027,536873053,536873064,536873066,536873362,536873455,536873473,536873973,536873999,536874182,536874398,536874743,536874745,536874813,536875042,536875046,536875050,536875062,536875067,536875081,536875097,536875101,536875112,536875116,536875132,536875137,536875157,536875197,536875200,536875201,536875213,536875214,536875242,536875257,536875315,536875317,536875319,536875322,536875324,536875328,536875330,536875331,536875332,536875340,536875358,536875372,536875400,536875420,536875464,536875484,536875485,536875488,536875492,536875506,536875510,536875523,536875524,536875534,536875537,536875538,536875540,536875543,536875544,536875545,536875549,536875572,536875574,536875639,536875667,536875675,536875690,536875699,536875792,536875802,536875803,536875814,536875820,536875822,536875830,536875871,536875896,536875903,536875907,536875909,536875911,536875913,536875918,536875930,536875934,536875941,536875944,536876016,536876021,536876031,536876054,536876083,536876084,536876120,536876126,536876232,536876235,536876302,536876339,536876340,536876348,536876352,536876357,536876377,536876380,536876395,536876408,536876413,536876415,536876474,536876490,536876499,536876542,536876545,536876597,536876600,536876603,536876630,536876642,536876645,536876660,536876800,536876879,536876980,536877239,536877253,536877287,536877666,536877713,536877740,536877928,536877933,536877935,536877960,536877963,536878004,536878007,536878009,536878012,536878015,536878016,536878025,536878030,536878146,536878317,536878346,536878464,536878512,536878519,536878565,536878567,536879048,536879604,536879605,536879709,536879718,536879730,536879731,536879870,536880163,536880173,536880251,536880582,536880637,536880959,536880960,536881123,536881249,536881939,536882367,536882766,536883875,536883903,536884934,536886213,536888127,536889479,536891414,536891415,536896462],"videos":[{"id":34403,"video_id":"a5fV223-exw"}]},{"id":20524,"aggregated_rating":72.0,"cover":{"id":133848,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co2va0.jpg"},"name":"Uno","platforms":[{"id":12,"name":"Xbox 360"}],"screenshots":[{"id":27876,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/lsatfevtlhe0g4gwlalr.jpg"}],"summary":"UNO is the classic party card game that's number one for family fun!

Locking the enemy in your crosshairs, signified by your crosshairs turning red, doesn't guarantee a direct hit? The accuracy depends on the weapon of choice.

Running around wildly, they created monsters who disturbed the peace in the world and provoked two mighty nations to start an all-destroying war. After years of battles and pain, the two nations finally decided to sign a peace agreement. Now they wish concentrate together on hunting down and eliminating the insane Spirits. You control a young boy named Evan, who wants to become a Ranger (a fighter who possesses unique abilities), like his father. But before he can be initiated as a Ranger, he has to fulfill an important mission and help to save his world from the Spirits. \n \nGrandia Xtreme is the first Grandia game to be originally released for Playstation 2. Its combat system is virtually the same as in the previous two games, a mixture of strategic planning and combo attacks. Your party members can run around, avoid enemy attacks, and their attack power depends on their distance from the enemies. Grandia Xtreme is heavily based on combat, with more dungeons, more fighting, and less story than the two previous installments of the series.","tags":[1,268435468,268435487,536871138,536871139,536871213,536871470,536871938,536871939,536872425,536872594,536874398,536875196,536875409,536875420,536875455,536875525,536875738,536875803,536875822,536875830,536875952,536876908,536876969,536877006,536877596,536878078,536880549,536884029]},{"id":9149,"aggregated_rating":45.0,"cover":{"id":9577,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/zludacgwaun7s3ayufj4.jpg"},"name":"Guilty Gear Dust Strikers","platforms":[{"id":20,"name":"Nintendo DS"}],"screenshots":[{"id":160665,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/ehb03g5kqcmj2ofdiywv.jpg"},{"id":160666,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/egmtdaqbeljupxctbonl.jpg"},{"id":160667,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/qndfzqphiyulg0kqnzhs.jpg"},{"id":160668,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/ebxzac12wgggkqyfkqjp.jpg"},{"id":160669,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/c7n6frfgr0wdmtiifqhm.jpg"},{"id":160670,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/jr2p60o5p1p8kc2b79ro.jpg"}],"summary":"The no holds barred, sci-fi fighting franchise is reborn on the Nintendo DS.

A multi-player option allows for a different player to control each monster.\n\nCritical reaction to Double Smash was largely negative. IGN gave the game a score of 3 out of 10, saying: \"None of the recent Godzilla games have been very good, but at least they were fun. Godzilla Unleashed: Double Smash cannot make this claim. It looks terrible, and reduces the King of the Monsters to a mush of no-texture polygons, then puts him in a tedious series of punching planes and kicking boats.\" GameSpot gave Double Smash a 2 out of 10, calling it \"one of the worst DS games ever made,\" adding: \"With a perfect storm of terrible game design, bad play mechanics, and uninspired destruction, this game does what oxidation bombs, volcanoes, and Matthew Broderick couldn't: It kills Godzilla.\" GameSpy gave the game a 1 out of 5, saying: \"This brain-dead combat is perhaps the worst part of Double Smash.

The Amahagane are sacred jewels which grant the owners godlike powers, such as Kamui. Now, rumors are spreading of new, ungodly creatures fighting with Heishi warriors, even without the powers of Amahagane. Yoshitsune and his companions must draw their weapons again, and with the new strength given to them by the Amahagane, defeat the new evil to save all of Japan. \n \nGenji: Days of the Blade, sequel to the PlayStation 2 game Genji: Dawn of the Samurai, is an action game, based in ancient/feudal Japan, in which you must defeat a new, mysterious source of evil to save your country. You control one of four characters (changeable in real-time), each with their own weapons, abilities, strengths, and weaknesses. \n \nYoshitsune Minamoto and Benkei Musashibo, the main characters of the previous game, join with Gozen Shizuka and Lord Buson to complete their quest. Yoshitsune is a young warrior who wields a katana in each hand, Benkei is a mighty warrior-monk who uses a war club and a naginata for weapons. Shizuka is a nimble priestess who is adept with chained blades, and Buson is a God of War from the Overworld who carries a double saber and can use supernatural powers. \n \nThe game play involves fighting many enemies and bosses with regular attacks, combo attacks, and Kamui. Kamui is a power that you can use to summon a magical space around you in which you unleash multiple special attacks on surrounding enemies by pressing buttons in series as they appear on the screen. Your Kamui bar fills as you land successful hits on opponents. The characters travel through both levels based on real locations in Japan and fantasy locations, defeating everything from regular Heishi warriors to giant, mutated enemy crabs. The level design involves platformer elements and solving small puzzles, such as destroying Masho flowers scattered throughout an area to open a door. \n \nThe game also has RPG elements; you collect Amahagane and Mashogane hidden around levels and from fallen enemies. They can be used to augment character stats and weapon attack power, respectively. You can also find new weapons and items such as herbs with healing properties, or scrolls that give you attack bonuses for a period of time.","tags":[1,22,268435481,268435487,536873712,536875435,536893535],"videos":[{"id":36859,"video_id":"6POg0fjhpYU"}]},{"id":81497,"cover":{"id":153462,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co3aeu.jpg"},"name":"Game & Watch Gallery 4","platforms":[{"id":24,"name":"Game Boy Advance"},{"id":41,"name":"Wii U"}],"screenshots":[{"id":442472,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc9hew.jpg"},{"id":442473,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc9hex.jpg"},{"id":442474,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc9hey.jpg"},{"id":442475,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc9hez.jpg"},{"id":442476,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc9hf0.jpg"}],"summary":"Relive the birth of handheld gaming with over a dozen classic Game & Watch games.

One of the games was developed by 5th Cell for the Nintendo DS, while the other was created by Planet Moon Studios for the Wii.[1][\n\nThe game begins with a surreal sequence, wherein an unknown party asks the player “What do you remember about that day?” The player is given several dialogue choices that build a cohesive description of \"that day\", though at this time, the player is not aware of the event's importance (or even occurrence). Before the game properly begins, the player is asked to draw an image depicting this mysterious scene, introducing them to the game's core \"draw\" functionality.\n\nFollowing this is an animation sequence wherein one of the characters from the previous game, Heather, recovers from a nightmare. She is shown to possess a red-colored jewel pendant. In the same sequence, Heather is abducted by a darkness which emanated from a scepter she discovered in a beached treasure chest in the middle of the night. The next morning, when the other characters realize she's missing, a search for her is dramatically cut short by Wilfre, who causes the majority of the Raposa villagers to vanish, reveals himself as Heather's captor, and ultimately drains the Village of color. The remaining characters flee to the back of a massive turtle delivered, upon request, by the Creator.\n\nTheir numbers sorely reduced and their home ruined, the game follows the Raposa's struggle to reunite with their fellows and, with the aid of the Creator's Hero of Creation, defeat Wilfre before he can realize his as-yet unknown goals. The remaining members of the Village travel to Watersong, Lavasteam, the Galactic Jungle, and Wilfre's Wasteland, a combination of all three villages. At Watersong, Mari and Jowee meet Sock, who is an important character later in the story.","tags":[1,268435464,268435487,536871737,536871945,536874136,536875073,536883865]},{"id":49939,"cover":{"id":46772,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/ajp1ccphfuzsrjhtzdmz.jpg"},"name":"Dragon Tales: Dragon Wings","platforms":[{"id":22,"name":"Game Boy Color"}],"summary":"The popular animated television series is now a magical hand-held game!

Ten game modes - both team-based and \"every man for himself\" -- provide even the most hardcore gamer with palm-sweating challenges through unbelievably detailed indoor arenas and vast outdoor environments. As the ultimate techno-gladiator of the future, players will take their fates into their hands, battling against up to 32 other players online in action-packed, frag-filled arenas.\n\nAssault Mode - Assault mode returns! Redesigned for UT2004, this fan-favorite mode sees teams face-off to defend and attack fortified bases, from fast-moving trains, barreling across an arid alien desert to a Skaarj mother ship, poised to attack the human home world.\n\nOnslaught Mode - Onslaught mode takes team combat to the next level! Opposing teams are pitted against each other to capture and hold strategic points in order to attack and destroy the enemy power core. Taking place in massive outdoor environments, here is where vehicular combat comes into its own. Flying and driving machines take combatants to the frontline and gigantic mobile battle stations serve as a platform from which to launch devastating attacks.\n\nVehicles - Rev-up and ride out in an array of land-, air-, and space-based vehicles that play critical roles in a successful combat strategy in Assault and Onslaught. With vehicles ranging from single man fighters to five man behemoths, Unreal Tournament 2004 provides players with plenty of choices when shopping for a mechanized implement of destruction.\n\nLevels - More than 95 maps will be available immediately, including more than 45 brand new maps for all existing game play modes as well as new modes of play. Vast outdoor environments, deep space combat areas and tightly packed indoor techno-arenas are all waiting for the latest entrants to the Tournament.\n\nWeapons - The entire smorgasbord of frag-dealing weaponry from Unreal Tournament 2003 returns for the experienced player to wield masterfully against new contestants. Those armaments are joined by three new implements of doom: the Mine layer, which disperses spider-like bombs that chase and harass any enemy that comes within range; the anti vehicle rocket launcher, or AVRiL, which deals out a payload of massive rockets tuned to seek and destroy enemy mechanized units; the Grenade Launcher, which launches timed explosives that will bounce on the ground and stick to enemies and enemy vehicles, only to be triggered by the weapons altfire command; and, the return of the notorious Sniper Rifle from the original Unreal tournament, completely redesigned and upgraded to make heads roll.\n\nNew Characters - Unreal Tournament 2004 introduces 32 new characters on four new teams: The human Thunder Crash, lead by Tournament hero, Malcolm; the Robotic Corrupt, lead by an upgraded Xan Kriegor; the Iron Skull, a team of merciless Skaarj warriors; and the Hellions -- wreckless human mercenaries and pirates who delight in the thrill of the kill.\n\nNew Technology - Unreal Tournament not only brings new content for hardcore fans to relish, it also delivers a tremendous technology update over its predecessor, delivering a faster, slicker, deeper experience than ever before.","tags":[1,18,268435461,536870915,536870979,536871041,536871213,536871365,536871470,536871487,536871882,536872028,536872070,536872245,536872352,536872375,536872406,536872462,536872583,536872594,536872681,536872983,536873067,536873236,536873356,536873715,536874076,536874077,536874743,536874813,536874900,536874947,536875046,536875056,536875073,536875097,536875242,536875265,536875298,536875358,536875453,536875484,536875488,536875492,536875527,536875542,536875573,536875609,536875642,536875682,536875804,536875814,536875819,536875822,536875830,536875901,536875902,536875904,536875941,536876063,536876221,536876232,536876262,536876355,536876357,536876391,536876412,536876415,536876435,536876472,536876511,536876521,536876633,536876660,536876732,536876748,536876855,536876856,536876857,536876899,536876934,536876947,536876961,536877144,536877208,536877210,536877211,536877212,536877213,536877215,536877220,536877227,536877252,536877264,536877283,536877407,536877443,536877526,536877531,536877618,536877628,536877647,536877820,536877935,536877938,536877950,536877952,536877974,536878002,536878004,536878005,536878036,536878104,536878317,536878579,536879214,536879218,536879704,536879705,536879707,536879711,536879869,536879870,536879992,536880184,536880208,536880225,536880442,536880625,536880737,536880765,536880768,536880815,536880816,536880872,536880959,536881514,536881515,536881542,536881629,536882016,536882359,536882508,536882698,536883190,536883191,536883206,536883253,536884022,536884125,536884133,536884244,536884245,536884246,536884249,536884250,536884251,536886095,536886273,536886275,536886276,536886277,536886572,536886573,536886611,536886612,536886613,536886614,536886615,536886616,536886617,536886618,536900108],"videos":[{"id":36255,"video_id":"w32mceDfgSI"}]},{"id":129,"cover":{"id":90529,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co1xup.jpg"},"name":"Warcraft: Orcs & Humans","platforms":[{"id":13,"name":"PC DOS"},{"id":14,"name":"Mac"}],"screenshots":[{"id":16593,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/qnoocrkvjko6ajz6izlc.jpg"},{"id":16594,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/wuzbx46786srwqf6xvkd.jpg"}],"summary":"Warcraft: Orcs & Humans is the first game in the Warcraft series developed by Blizzard Entertainment.

With the focus more on coaching instead of playing with big-name stars, COLLEGE HOOPS 2K6 puts the player in charge of an NCAA team of their own. Gamers can select from nearly every NCAA coach currently in the industry or create their own. Each coach has a number of different attributes, and these attributes will determine many different aspects of the game. Charisma, for example, affects recruitment and player confidence, while discipline will help players focus on the game. Players may also bring issues to the coach to solve, which also affects the team's playing ability as well. Gamers will also have access to the coach's clipboard during the game. The clipboard will pop up automatically when gamers need to make adjustments instead of requiring gamers to access a series of menus. Another new feature are the four points of emphasis: ball control, defense, rebounding, and shot selection. Selecting one will boast the team's particular effectiveness in that area proportionate to the coach's attributes. Recruiting, likewise, has been upgraded and tweaked. Gamers can track 15 potential recruits during the season, watching their interest levels and stats and have the option of controlling the recruiting themselves or allowing the assistant coaches to deal many of the decisions. COLLEGE HOOPS 2K6 perfectly captures all of the aspects of coaching a NCAA team but, with assistant coaches and other options, never makes the gamer feel overwhelmed.","tags":[268435469,268435470,536870970,536871592,536872060,536872078,536872205,536875138,536875186,536875271,536875562,536875749,536875802,536876762,536876821,536881505,536883028]},{"id":15762,"aggregated_rating":70.0,"cover":{"id":170229,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co3ncl.jpg"},"name":"Codename: Panzers - Cold War","platforms":[{"id":6,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}],"screenshots":[{"id":46286,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/c08dtwbgjqdzteacv7zu.jpg"},{"id":46287,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/phxrb4vyeuf2vp1z459v.jpg"},{"id":46288,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/b5ojdeh6vokfuj7vabrw.jpg"},{"id":46289,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/uk2l9sli1iyrdh6hoo4u.jpg"},{"id":46290,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/ew7kxtrxr2hp0dfio7th.jpg"}],"summary":"A major armed conflict is brewing between the Western powers and the Soviet bloc.

Praetorian players could also attack new Neutral mobs and would eventually be able to play a mission that allowed them to choose to be a Hero or Villain and complete gameplay in the original games.

Compendium is as the name implies a compilation-style project, containing a hand picked collection of some of the best doom maps/wads released from 1994 to roughly 2004-2005, representing the classic era of Doom modding. All the mappacks represented have been remastered (in the sense that outdated DeHackED code has been converted to DECORATE/ACS) and bugfixed (generally speaking I've removed all bugs I've found which can allow a player to become stuck in a level, including a ton of fixes that should ensure much better multiplayer compatibility), but they are otherwise untouched, as it is not my intention to mess with the authors' original vision. This means that there are no new rooms, no different thing placements and nothing of the sort to be found in this. Each of the wads included in this is accessible from a (currently functional but unfinished) central hub map. After you complete one of the mappacks, you are sent back to the hub map, which means you can keep your arsenal when going to the next one (or simply start a new game to be taken back to the same hub map with a clear arsenal).\n\nThere are right now 54 wads represented, for a total of over one thousand levels. I've tried to ensure that this project is fully compatible with gameplay mods, and hopefully that is indeed the case: this includes the wads that previously broke horribly due to dehacked patches. Please note however that as of the current release there are no new weapons included. Some of the wads included in this are well known vanilla megawads from the time, such as Memento Mori, Obituary and STRAIN. Others are wads that take advantage of ZDoom features, such as Daedalus and Project Slipgate. Others yet take Doom gameplay to creative new heights, like Cyberdreams or All Hell is Breaking Loose. Some are celebrated classics, others are undiscovered gems. Some, like Eternal Doom, have absolutely massive maps which will take a long time to navigate, others, like Scythe, focus on quick and intense gun and run action. I've tried to go for as much variety as I could in terms of the styles of gameplay and level design offered here, so I am sure that you are bound to find at least one mappack you'd really like in this.\n\nSome might wonder what the point of such a project is. One could, after all, simply download the relevant wads off the idgames database as needed. And indeed, my aim here is not that of replacing the original files, which should be preserved and rejoiced in exactly the way they used to be. As far as I'm aware there have not been similar projects to this released yet, although other communities such as the Duke Nukem 3D one have made something comparable. That being said, the advantages of having a project like this are numerous. For one thing all the 54 wads included here are completely cross-compatible which means you don't have to load each of them separately. This is particularly advantageous for those who wish to play using RPG-style mods with a very large arsenal and experience systems, etc (DoomRL comes to mind for example). It is also extremely useful for multiplayer hosting on Zandronum, as instead of hosting 54 servers you would need to host only one. Now not only that but as I mentioned, the code conversion and bugfixing makes these the most up to date and polished repackagings that these wads have seen yet. Some of these were still stuck in old DOS installers and such, personally I think it's about time someone made a modern repackaging to be enjoyed by all GZDoom users without hassle. Last but not least, I have spent a very long time digging the idgames archives (among other sites) to find interesting old wads that have slipped past the spotlights, so this project beyond being one of bugfixing and ease of use, is also (at least as far as I'm concerned) one of documentation. This is a love letter to that period of Doom modding which in my opinion holds some of the best maps ever made for the game, from which I think mappers even today could have a lot to learn."},{"id":312,"aggregated_rating":84.3333333333333,"cover":{"id":91142,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co1ybq.jpg"},"name":"DOOM II: Hell on Earth","platforms":[{"id":6,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"},{"id":12,"name":"Xbox 360"},{"id":13,"name":"PC DOS"},{"id":14,"name":"Mac"},{"id":44,"name":"Tapwave Zodiac"},{"id":130,"name":"Nintendo Switch"}],"screenshots":[{"id":46894,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/t3rxwiugxxvfnvswciny.jpg"},{"id":46895,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/ohyfbvfgz4qzyq8tcomf.jpg"},{"id":46896,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/g521tobrpjoxpbdsnv8z.jpg"},{"id":46897,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/bhnsez83rgnyovag1r8b.jpg"},{"id":46898,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/bdcoqpwzyubbdwphkrss.jpg"}],"summary":"Let the Obsession begin.

There are two game modes: arcade and simulation. Arcade mode allows re-spawning of damaged vehicle parts. In Simulation mode, all damage is permanent for the race. The game supports the analog controller.","tags":[1,268435466,268435470]},{"id":2626,"aggregated_rating":90.5,"cover":{"id":123757,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co2nhp.jpg"},"name":"Burnout Revenge","platforms":[{"id":8,"name":"PlayStation 2"},{"id":11,"name":"Xbox"},{"id":12,"name":"Xbox 360"}],"screenshots":[{"id":2962,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/fow9ntgqhhxjccdnbplo.jpg"},{"id":2963,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/lgun3twbqsqsv16has5q.jpg"},{"id":2964,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/ndk78tcf5gylr6y5w4of.jpg"}],"summary":"In Burnout Revenge, players compete in a range of racing game types with different aims. These take place within rush-hour traffic, and include circuit racing, Road Rage (where players cause as many rivals to crash as possible within a time limit, or until the player's car is wrecked), Burning Lap (a single-lap, single-racer time attack mode), Eliminator (a circuit race where every thirty seconds, the last-placed racer's car is detonated; the race continues until only one racer is left), and Crash (where the player is placed at a junction with the aim of accumulating as many \"Crash Dollars\" as possible). A new gameplay feature in Burnout Revenge is the ability to ram same-way small to medium traffic, known as \"traffic checking\", propelling the rammed car forward; the event in which a \"checked\" car hits a rival is considered as a Traffic Takedown. Traffic checking is the focus of a new race type, Traffic Attack (whereby a player must earn a set amount of Crash Dollars through checking traffic), which can be used later on.\nDuring these events, players have access to a limited amount of boost which is acquired through various dangerous driving techniques, including but not limited to driving on the wrong side of the road, tailgating opponents and drifting. Unique to the series is the concept of battling other rivals; unlike other video games in the racing genre, players are encouraged, and sometimes even required, to ram rival cars and cause traffic to crash. Causing a rival to crash is referred to as a \"Takedown\", rewarding the player by extending the length of their boost gauge and completely refilling it. In designated events, boost can also be used to activate a \"Crashbreaker\" during a crash, detonating the car and causing other nearby cars to crash. When the rival car takes the player down, the player will have to take the ultimate REVENGE by taking down the revenge rivals (which the arrow at the top of the car turned red) is referred to as \"Revenge Takedown\".\nIn the main single-player game mode, players compete in a world tour consisting of 169 events across three continents, divided into a series of 11 \"ranks\" (Rank 11 has no events). The ranks which a player has access to is determined by their \"Revenge Rank\", which increases after completing events. By increasing their Rank sufficiently, the player \"ranks up\" and unlocks the next rank of events.\nThere are 77 cars in the game, some of which can only be used for crash events. The SUVs and saloon cars are some of them.\nThe game also features support for multiplayer gameplay, both online and offline. In addition to the racing modes, the game features three types of Crash modes: Crash Battle (multiple players attempt a junction at the same time), Crash Party (players take turns at attempting junctions across several rounds), and Crash Tour (a golf-like version of Crash Party, with players attempting to accumulate a certain amount of Crash Dollars in as few attempts as possible; after the last round ends the player with the lowest score wins).\n\nThe Xbox 360 version of Burnout Revenge includes several new features and improves the graphics of the game to utilize the power of the next-gen console. The game includes 10 new crash junctions on the Crash Tour. It also includes a vastly improved online mode that introduces online Revenge Rivals. This system allows players to keep track of their number of times they have been taken out or have taken out any given player.\nThe new version also includes a new Burnout Clips feature, which allows to save 30 second clips of any offline race played and can be shared with other players over Xbox Live.","tags":[1,268435466,536870937,536871313,536871314,536871647,536872152,536872205,536872221,536872245,536872352,536872415,536872511,536872587,536872590,536872695,536873053,536873064,536873274,536873390,536874539,536874743,536874824,536875069,536875073,536875095,536875122,536875133,536875194,536875271,536875364,536875413,536875456,536875488,536875490,536875709,536875715,536875732,536875781,536875802,536875955,536876108,536876199,536876214,536876314,536876435,536876466,536876514,536876695,536876762,536876821,536876948,536877108,536877223,536877318,536877517,536877696,536877744,536877911,536877938,536877982,536877998,536878071,536878545,536879167,536879193,536880084,536880134,536880272,536880441,536880839,536880840,536881347,536881348,536881349,536881573,536881679,536882021,536882168,536882450,536882666,536883028,536883074,536883623,536883737,536883943,536884021,536884430,536885957,536885958,536886215,536886397],"videos":[{"id":13177,"video_id":"9H-aqCWuCnQ"},{"id":13178,"video_id":"SH2Zyk5wb1A"}]},{"id":44959,"cover":{"id":50000,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/lp0ph6teuogpkvt3vhn0.jpg"},"name":"Builder's Block","platforms":[{"id":7,"name":"PlayStation"}],"summary":"Builder's Block is a puzzle game in which you must construct buildings and then eliminate them for points.

The game features score attack gameplay similar to the Guitar Hero games. The controller consists of a wireless deck consisting of a movable turntable that supports 3 \"stream\" buttons, an effects dial, a crossfader, and a \"Euphoria\" button; a hidden panel contains additional controller buttons to interact with the gaming console outside of the game. A portion of the controller can be detached and reattached to adapt the unit for left-handed players. Notes travel in an arc across a spinning record on screen, and the player holds down one of the 3 stream buttons to play notes; two buttons reflect the two songs used in that particular mix, and the third represents samples to add to the mix which can be adjusted with the effects dial. The player must also constantly adjust the crossfader to match onscreen symbols, which alters the relative volume of the songs as to bring one song to the forefront of the mix for a short time. Certain tracks are shown on screen as a series of up or down arrow, representing scratching sections, requiring the player to turn the turntable in the direction of the arrows while holding down the button to score points, mimicking the scratching of the record needle on vinyl albums. \"Euphoria\" is equivalent to Guitar Hero's Star Power, collected by successfully completing specific phrases in the song mix, called Perfect Regions, and can be released by pressing the Euphoria button, doubling the player's current multiplier as well as automatic crossfading when active. There is also a \"Rewind\" meter that builds through consistent successful playing, and once full, allows the player to rewind the song to fix errors in their performance. The player must continue to perform well or their performance meter will drop and the music track will cut out. Failing the song is not possible, unlike in Guitar Hero games.\n\nA single player career mode is available, as well both competitive and cooperative multiplayer modes (\"DJ vs DJ\"), playable locally or remotely. Ten songs have been specially mixed to also support gameplay with Guitar Hero and other compatible guitar controllers in a \"DJ vs Guitar\" mode. Players can also use a microphone for a non-scoring addition to the mix. A Party Play mode allows the game to automatically play the songs with the ability for a player to jump in and play at any time.","tags":[268435463,536871400,536872205,536872594,536872862,536873830,536873861,536875049,536875133,536875157,536875245,536875257,536875281,536875426,536875751,536875781,536875784,536875941,536875943,536876101,536876102,536876199,536876375,536876703,536876907,536877144,536877275,536877389,536877402,536877953,536880052,536880054,536880245,536881123,536881831,536883865,536883905,536883994,536884121]},{"id":44766,"cover":{"id":53990,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/fcasbqrz3zpnzosjqhdf.jpg"},"name":"BursTrick WakeBoarding","platforms":[{"id":7,"name":"PlayStation"}],"screenshots":[{"id":801813,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sch6ol.jpg"},{"id":801814,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sch6om.jpg"},{"id":801815,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sch6on.jpg"}],"summary":"BursTrick: Wake Boarding!! is an extreme-sports game using gameplay similar to Wave Race 64, the main difference being that, as you are pulled by a boat when wake boarding, it is almost like an auto-scroller and you do not have nearly as much freedom of movement.\n\nThere are two gameplay modes, Obstacle and Trick.

Players are able to attack using their weapon, jump and cast spells that hurt all enemies on the screen. The force of this magic depends on the number of \"bars\" of magic power currently available. The bars are filled by collecting blue 'magic potions' attained by kicking little sprites who then drop the potions. These sprites appear during regular levels and during bonus stages in between levels. The male warrior Ax is able to cast earth spells. The dwarf Gilius, casts lightning spells and the female warrior Tyris casts fire magic. Each character has a different number of maximum magic bars and varying ranges of attack.\n\nVarious steeds known as bizarrians are found in the game. These can be ridden when the enemy rider is knocked off, or if one is found dormant. The least powerful steed is known as the Cockatrice, which can be used to knock down enemies with a swipe of its tail. The more powerful dragon, which can either shoot fireballs or breathe fire, is found later in the game.","tags":[1,17,268435481,268435489,536871138,536871139,536871174,536871208,536871244,536871301,536871470,536871617,536871874,536871894,536871971,536872039,536872070,536872218,536872232,536872617,536872978,536873384,536873400,536873810,536874831,536875046,536875047,536875057,536875073,536875197,536875198,536875200,536875319,536875390,536875434,536875435,536875460,536875463,536875464,536875488,536875609,536875610,536875638,536875655,536875778,536875791,536875792,536875802,536875871,536875912,536875944,536876010,536876084,536876215,536876287,536876362,536876413,536876437,536876545,536876606,536876620,536876726,536876944,536876989,536877063,536877298,536877406,536877495,536877562,536877679,536878073,536878083,536878147,536878324,536878359,536878505,536878512,536878525,536879727,536879758,536879840,536880287,536880320,536880564,536880841,536880871,536881330,536881580,536881749,536882346,536882811,536883748,536883995,536885414,536888127,536892539,536892540],"videos":[{"id":2446,"video_id":"YB8cdGk_M3g"}]},{"id":192114,"cover":{"id":210731,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co4iln.jpg"},"name":"Sonic Adventure: Sonic Adventure DX Upgrade","platforms":[{"id":9,"name":"PlayStation 3"},{"id":12,"name":"Xbox 360"}],"summary":"DLC for the PlayStation Network and Xbox Live Arcade versions of Sonic Adventure.

The game features interactive cutscenes which transition seamlessly into continuing gameplay; there are no loading screens across gameplay and cutscenes.","tags":[1,20,33,268435461,536870933,536870997,536871033,536871041,536871133,536871134,536871213,536871470,536871506,536871801,536871937,536872048,536872070,536872205,536872211,536872221,536872245,536872285,536872315,536872352,536872581,536872587,536872622,536872626,536872695,536872810,536872862,536872873,536872883,536872983,536873053,536873249,536873352,536873364,536873753,536873810,536873889,536873973,536873999,536874398,536874706,536874743,536874916,536874947,536875046,536875073,536875081,536875095,536875098,536875110,536875114,536875157,536875158,536875182,536875192,536875199,536875209,536875216,536875228,536875229,536875249,536875250,536875265,536875271,536875275,536875281,536875288,536875304,536875326,536875330,536875332,536875340,536875358,536875362,536875396,536875415,536875417,536875418,536875433,536875436,536875437,536875440,536875453,536875460,536875483,536875488,536875491,536875492,536875494,536875500,536875501,536875504,536875506,536875508,536875510,536875523,536875527,536875537,536875538,536875564,536875565,536875572,536875583,536875590,536875623,536875642,536875650,536875656,536875668,536875700,536875728,536875743,536875745,536875781,536875792,536875802,536875803,536875804,536875808,536875809,536875813,536875817,536875818,536875830,536875832,536875855,536875868,536875870,536875880,536875941,536876029,536876032,536876068,536876073,536876083,536876084,536876097,536876098,536876099,536876109,536876125,536876130,536876175,536876176,536876179,536876180,536876181,536876210,536876221,536876258,536876261,536876262,536876273,536876274,536876275,536876277,536876322,536876323,536876332,536876333,536876338,536876356,536876362,536876363,536876364,536876365,536876419,536876422,536876423,536876426,536876434,536876459,536876469,536876482,536876505,536876511,536876520,536876521,536876529,536876550,536876569,536876587,536876596,536876600,536876616,536876617,536876626,536876641,536876648,536876654,536876666,536876669,536876687,536876695,536876703,536876723,536876724,536876725,536876808,536876821,536876833,536876851,536876853,536876871,536876875,536876899,536876968,536876978,536876987,536877009,536877028,536877047,536877049,536877109,536877128,536877149,536877157,536877170,536877176,536877182,536877226,536877238,536877239,536877268,536877278,536877286,536877302,536877312,536877319,536877329,536877346,536877352,536877373,536877377,536877383,536877384,536877451,536877452,536877490,536877501,536877502,536877587,536877605,536877628,536877648,536877656,536877664,536877665,536877713,536877726,536877741,536877780,536877802,536877874,536877907,536877950,536877970,536878003,536878004,536878029,536878032,536878201,536878265,536878266,536878270,536878298,536878304,536878314,536878396,536878505,536878584,536879020,536879023,536879037,536879042,536879050,536879062,536879096,536879117,536879188,536879220,536879678,536879707,536879714,536879718,536879763,536879870,536879895,536879957,536879984,536880286,536880343,536880640,536880721,536880785,536880788,536880901,536880949,536881020,536881246,536881277,536881284,536881586,536881599,536881621,536881972,536882006,536882118,536882545,536882546,536882770,536882880,536882943,536883249,536883865,536884185,536884417,536884857,536884858,536884859,536884860,536884861,536884862,536889479,536892082,536892083,536892084],"videos":[{"id":648,"video_id":"J2UYToJyZaU"}]},{"id":19,"aggregated_rating":84.2857142857143,"cover":{"id":120981,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co2lcl.jpg"},"name":"Max Payne 2: The Fall of Max Payne","platforms":[{"id":6,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"},{"id":8,"name":"PlayStation 2"},{"id":9,"name":"PlayStation 3"},{"id":11,"name":"Xbox"},{"id":12,"name":"Xbox 360"}],"screenshots":[{"id":1173,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/cc0berjmosjw8u3znfv9.jpg"},{"id":1174,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/emdp8dyfmzbitsxbsdi3.jpg"},{"id":1175,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/qwaqp1uuyvezcf88rwyj.jpg"},{"id":1176,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/ldymtknsdvwxchhnr7xk.jpg"},{"id":9931,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/de7g6xhsy4hffuvvw0iy.jpg"}],"summary":"Max Payne 2 is a third-person shooter, in which the player assumes the role of Max Payne, but also plays as Mona Sax in a few levels.

Like its predecessor, A Boy and His Blob: Trouble on Blobolonia, The Rescue of Princess Blobette is a puzzle-platformer in which the player directly controls the boy as he is followed around by the blob, who is controlled by the computer AI. The pair must navigate the various passages and floors of the castle to locate and free Blobette. The boy can only run back and forth, cannot jump or swim, and will die if he falls a long distance or comes in contact with dangerous objects such as flame throwers and sewer serpents. However, the blob can be made to turn into useful tools when he is fed jelly beans of various flavors. Each flavor causes a different transformation. For example, feeding the blob a tangerine jelly bean will change him into a trampoline, which the boy can then use to reach high platforms. The player may also locate extra jelly bean sacks and numerous, optional treasures. Finding five peppermints will increase the player's extra lives by one.","tags":[1,268435464,268435465,536875055,536875637,536875868,536879148,536879691,536880045]},{"id":12522,"cover":{"id":223767,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co4snr.jpg"},"name":"Jackie Chan's Action Kung Fu","platforms":[{"id":18,"name":"Nintendo Entertainment System (NES)"},{"id":86,"name":"TurboGrafx-16/PC Engine"}],"screenshots":[{"id":14228,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/u2bmzlkns6igho2t1mky.jpg"},{"id":14229,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/oys6a7hykqvzjygzxh5l.jpg"},{"id":14233,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/q9ilvexkblub3zrtvm2v.jpg"}],"summary":"Jackie and his sister, Josephine, are tough on tyrants.

Based on the film of the same name, Disney's Aladdin is a 2D side-scrolling video game in which the player characters are Aladdin and his monkey Abu. The game was released in November 1993, the same month that another game with the same title was released by Virgin Games for Sega Genesis. The two games vary in several respects, including the fact that Aladdin carries a sword in the Virgin game but does not in the Capcom game, a fact that Shinji Mikami, the Capcom game's designer, said made the Virgin game better. The Capcom game was ported to Game Boy Advance (GBA) on March 19, 2004.","tags":[1,268435464,268435487,536871038,536871075,536871138,536871139,536871208,536871557,536871939,536871971,536872232,536872293,536872475,536872617,536872961,536873300,536874190,536874745,536875054,536875073,536875074,536875075,536875076,536875080,536875081,536875082,536875096,536875209,536875243,536875265,536875282,536875291,536875292,536875294,536875343,536875531,536875606,536875670,536875768,536875778,536875837,536875870,536875871,536876010,536876185,536876208,536876314,536876326,536876348,536876353,536876437,536876634,536876694,536876717,536876735,536876852,536876952,536877057,536878192,536878439,536878484,536879125,536879148,536880042,536880227,536880676,536880854,536883263,536884022,536885414,536885995,536897818],"videos":[{"id":43686,"video_id":"5IXhJs8DZt0"}]},{"id":144818,"cover":{"id":134197,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co2vjp.jpg"},"name":"Hero of Not Our Time","platforms":[{"id":6,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}],"screenshots":[{"id":631020,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scdiwc.jpg"},{"id":631021,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scdiwd.jpg"},{"id":631022,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scdiwe.jpg"},{"id":631023,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scdiwf.jpg"},{"id":631024,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scdiwg.jpg"},{"id":631025,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scdiwh.jpg"},{"id":631026,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scdiwi.jpg"},{"id":631027,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scdiwj.jpg"},{"id":631028,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scdiwk.jpg"},{"id":631029,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scdiwl.jpg"},{"id":631030,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scdiwm.jpg"},{"id":631031,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scdiwn.jpg"},{"id":631032,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scdiwo.jpg"},{"id":631033,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scdiwp.jpg"},{"id":631034,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scdiwq.jpg"},{"id":631035,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scdiwr.jpg"},{"id":631036,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scdiws.jpg"},{"id":631037,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scdiwt.jpg"},{"id":631038,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scdiwu.jpg"}],"summary":"Hero of Not Our Time is a 2D top-down action game with elements of 90s classics.

Zone II: The Tears of Opa-Opa is the sequel to Fantasy Zone, in which you control Opa-Opa, a pretty colored ship with wings on its side. You must destroy the large creatures in each world before moving on to the next. Your task becomes difficult by other small creatures that happen to pass by. If you destroy a large creature, they will drop a dollar bill, which you can pick up and use at the shop to buy items and powerful weapons such as laser beams, x-way shots, and big wings. Another way to get money is to shoot certain kinds of enemies all in a row.\n\nMore often than not, some large creatures will reveal a warp gate rather than a dollar bill. You can go through the warp gate to get to another part of the land, and destroy more large creatures. Only one of them will have a warp gate in the form of a 'stop' sign - that is your ticket to the round boss, but you must defeat all large creatures in order to pass through it.

Throughout your career you will have to battle many enemies, all vying for the same title. As you play, you will be able to train, improving your boxer's stats. You can hit a punching bag to increase power and speed, spar with an opponent for more stamina and agility, attack the dummy to improve chin and body, or hit the mitts to improve heart and cut. Besides career mode, you have access to the standard modes. \n \nFight Night 2004 features the \"Total Control\" system, which utilizes both sticks to give you complete percision over your boxer's moves. The right analog stick controls all the punching, and the left stick controls movement and defense/blocks. \n \nThere are several unlockables available, all of which must be earned through career mode. You can buy new clothes, entrance music, even new girls to accompany you to the ring. \n \nThe PlayStation 2 version of Fight Night 2004 supports online play via EA Sports' online network. \n \nAs with all other EA Sports titles, Fight Night 2004 utilizes the EA Sports Bio, which tracks your progress through all EA Sports games.

Players can choose weapons before they send Pit into battle, giving them countless layers of strategies in each level.\n\nPlayers can choose between a basic Blade, basic Claws and a basic Orbitar weapon.

Jack is equally lethal in close-quarters combat, offering players branching melee combos, counterattacks and disarms as they take the fight to the criminal element of Grant City. Jack will encounter a variety of ruthless gangs in the filthy slums and menacing alleys of Grant City, each with their own unique abilities and fighting style that will test his resolve to crush their murderous stranglehold.","tags":[1,268435461,536870933,536871041,536871044,536871133,536871196,536871784,536871801,536871889,536871937,536872010,536872140,536872155,536872205,536872211,536872221,536872285,536872352,536872371,536872511,536872581,536872622,536872695,536872847,536872883,536872897,536873053,536873455,536873973,536873999,536874398,536874743,536875052,536875058,536875073,536875081,536875091,536875095,536875125,536875154,536875156,536875157,536875158,536875199,536875229,536875271,536875301,536875324,536875330,536875359,536875360,536875437,536875483,536875484,536875488,536875494,536875501,536875523,536875525,536875526,536875527,536875532,536875536,536875538,536875542,536875549,536875564,536875570,536875572,536875609,536875623,536875624,536875649,536875650,536875682,536875689,536875705,536875745,536875771,536875776,536875781,536875787,536875792,536875797,536875802,536875803,536875804,536875808,536875815,536875822,536875935,536875957,536876024,536876068,536876098,536876109,536876171,536876176,536876221,536876262,536876283,536876356,536876363,536876365,536876415,536876445,536876454,536876469,536876471,536876493,536876511,536876553,536876557,536876584,536876586,536876606,536876648,536876652,536876687,536876762,536876811,536876816,536876817,536876853,536876879,536876980,536876988,536876990,536877016,536877149,536877159,536877161,536877170,536877203,536877253,536877264,536877278,536877285,536877286,536877288,536877324,536877332,536877346,536877405,536877502,536877604,536877623,536877628,536877656,536877657,536877672,536877807,536877910,536877950,536877964,536877968,536878004,536878030,536878097,536878112,536878261,536878268,536878331,536878410,536878417,536879051,536879707,536879758,536879881,536880639,536880704,536880711,536880969,536881068,536881084,536881237,536881463,536881515,536881533,536881647,536882120,536883595,536883865,536884417],"videos":[{"id":10548,"video_id":"pZXx4X6NFrw"}]},{"id":55163,"aggregated_rating":86.6923076923077,"cover":{"id":139602,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co2zpu.jpg"},"name":"Resident Evil Village","platforms":[{"id":6,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"},{"id":48,"name":"PlayStation 4"},{"id":49,"name":"Xbox One"},{"id":167,"name":"PlayStation 5"},{"id":169,"name":"Xbox Series X|S"},{"id":170,"name":"Google Stadia"}],"screenshots":[{"id":419597,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc8zrh.jpg"},{"id":432308,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc99kk.jpg"},{"id":432309,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc99kl.jpg"},{"id":432310,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc99km.jpg"},{"id":432311,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc99kn.jpg"},{"id":432312,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc99ko.jpg"},{"id":432313,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc99kp.jpg"},{"id":432314,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc99kq.jpg"},{"id":432315,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc99kr.jpg"},{"id":432316,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc99ks.jpg"},{"id":432317,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc99kt.jpg"},{"id":432318,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc99ku.jpg"}],"summary":"Experience survival horror like never before in the 8th major installment in the Resident Evil franchise - Resident Evil Village.

The game tells the story of a futuristic confederation protected by an elite band of mercenaries: Dead Echo. When Dead Echo members Grayson Hunt and Ishi Sato learn they've been working for the wrong side, they're betrayed by their commander and exiled to the far reaches of the galaxy. In Bulletstorm, Grayson and Ishi find themselves surrounded by hordes of mutants and flesh eating gangs in an abandoned paradise. They have two objectives: get off the planet alive, and exact revenge on the man who sent them there.\n\nPlayers step into the role of Grayson Hunt complete with an arsenal of over-the-top combat moves and outrageously large guns. Bulletstorm's array of distinct 'skillshots' produces unprecedented levels of frantic gameplay and yell-inducing satisfaction. The skillshot system rewards players for inciting mayhem in the most creative way possible.

The game differs from most previous installments, which would involve a usual three-country campaign, while Call of Duty: Black Ops features two playable countries (Russia and the USA) but only has an American campaign. Several new features are also introduced, such as dive-to-prone and the available use of a flashlight on certain weapons. Furthermore, the campaign's playable characters now speak while being controlled by the player.","tags":[1,19,21,22,39,268435461,536870913,536870914,536870917,536870920,536870933,536870937,536870954,536871036,536871041,536871044,536871213,536871251,536871365,536871436,536871452,536871470,536871474,536871475,536871486,536871506,536871546,536871572,536871641,536871682,536871937,536871945,536872019,536872032,536872070,536872098,536872114,536872131,536872205,536872241,536872245,536872258,536872315,536872352,536872375,536872651,536872658,536872691,536872695,536873053,536873064,536873274,536873455,536874040,536874182,536874450,536874916,536874947,536875046,536875047,536875062,536875073,536875081,536875082,536875089,536875091,536875095,536875122,536875157,536875159,536875171,536875194,536875196,536875199,536875242,536875245,536875255,536875265,536875271,536875272,536875328,536875330,536875358,536875396,536875420,536875453,536875455,536875464,536875483,536875486,536875491,536875492,536875510,536875511,536875527,536875536,536875572,536875573,536875593,536875610,536875625,536875641,536875642,536875668,536875689,536875728,536875743,536875747,536875753,536875765,536875781,536875787,536875792,536875797,536875802,536875803,536875807,536875808,536875809,536875813,536875817,536875818,536875819,536875820,536875822,536875830,536875837,536875839,536875911,536875941,536876054,536876062,536876068,536876078,536876125,536876171,536876212,536876219,536876220,536876221,536876223,536876235,536876261,536876262,536876331,536876356,536876393,536876398,536876406,536876408,536876410,536876435,536876440,536876441,536876451,536876461,536876466,536876469,536876472,536876497,536876520,536876521,536876545,536876561,536876577,536876603,536876687,536876693,536876695,536876701,536876702,536876706,536876735,536876750,536876762,536876765,536876801,536876812,536876816,536876821,536876853,536876855,536876856,536876857,536876875,536876899,536876915,536876928,536876934,536876948,536876961,536876962,536877047,536877049,536877113,536877144,536877151,536877158,536877160,536877161,536877207,536877210,536877217,536877222,536877267,536877288,536877300,536877319,536877327,536877354,536877373,536877380,536877414,536877493,536877499,536877500,536877501,536877511,536877513,536877532,536877536,536877553,536877571,536877605,536877628,536877642,536877646,536877672,536877741,536877775,536877806,536877807,536877919,536877928,536877937,536877938,536877950,536877966,536877968,536877978,536877985,536877994,536878003,536878007,536878012,536878016,536878025,536878027,536878029,536878030,536878036,536878070,536878261,536878268,536878281,536878322,536878343,536878400,536878490,536878533,536878549,536879042,536879048,536879049,536879052,536879053,536879056,536879060,536879178,536879187,536879199,536879605,536879610,536879617,536879742,536879811,536879835,536879910,536879916,536879935,536879958,536879994,536880090,536880095,536880176,536880195,536880223,536880304,536880305,536880325,536880337,536880355,536880360,536880367,536880490,536880607,536880613,536880614,536880615,536880617,536880625,536880641,536880716,536880721,536880732,536880747,536880780,536880782,536880786,536880791,536880817,536880819,536880822,536880825,536880826,536880828,536880837,536880901,536880945,536880948,536880949,536881018,536881096,536881233,536881275,536881280,536881281,536881282,536881284,536881290,536881300,536881301,536881316,536881325,536881383,536881385,536881404,536881410,536881459,536881463,536881504,536881511,536881537,536881590,536881647,536881831,536882081,536882096,536882114,536882158,536882231,536882232,536882233,536882234,536882235,536882236,536882237,536882238,536882239,536882240,536882241,536882242,536882243,536882244,536882245,536882246,536882247,536882248,536882249,536882250,536882294,536882326,536882327,536882328,536882329,536882332,536882336,536882338,536882339,536882340,536882342,536882356,536882415,536882674,536882721,536882770,536882880,536882910,536882925,536882926,536882927,536882938,536882940,536882941,536882943,536882944,536882946,536883087,536883193,536883206,536883218,536883336,536883374,536883629,536883863,536883875,536883885,536883918,536883920,536884111,536884167,536884168,536884169,536884170,536884171,536884172,536884173,536884174,536884175,536884176,536884177,536884178,536884179,536884180,536884181,536884182,536884183,536884184,536884185,536884186,536884187,536884188,536884189,536884190,536884191,536884192,536884193,536884194,536884195,536884196,536884197,536884198,536884199,536884200,536884201,536884202,536884203,536887628,536889051,536889479,536892383,536892384],"videos":[{"id":36683,"video_id":"OPTOVQFRggI"},{"id":36684,"video_id":"cenzE-3C6NQ"}]},{"id":624,"aggregated_rating":78.3333333333333,"cover":{"id":95267,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co21ib.jpg"},"name":"Call

One night, while Sketch is working on Comix Zone during a thunderstorm, a lightning bolt strikes a panel of his comic. In this instant, the main villain of Comix Zone - a powerful mutant named Mortus - manages to escape the comic book's pages, desiring to kill Sketch so he can become flesh and blood and take over the real world. Because he does not possess any power in reality, Mortus sends Sketch into the world of his own comic, freely drawing in enemies to try and kill him.\n\nInside the comic book, Sketch meets General Alissa Cyan, who believes he is a superhero (\"the chosen one\") who came to save their post-apocalyptic world from the evil of Mortus and the alien invaders. Ignoring Sketch's protests, Alissa sends him on his mission, keeping in touch with instructions and hints via radio. It is up to Sketch to stop Mortus' evil plans and find a way out of this comic world before his own creations erase him for good.\n\nThe game has two possible endings. At the end of the game, Alissa attempts to defuse a Nuke, when Mortus comes into the comic and throws her into the chamber, which starts to fill up with liquid. Mortus then battles Sketch. If the player defeats Mortus and the Kreeps he summons quickly enough to drain the liquid and save Alissa, an ending occurs where Alissa comes to the real world with Sketch. Comix Zone is a huge success, being sold out on its first day, and Alissa joins the army, eventually becoming Chief of Security for the United States.

FIFA 2002 is the ninth game in the FIFA series. \n \nPower bars for passes were introduced, and dribbling reduced in order to attain a higher challenge level. The power bar can also be customised to suit the gamer's preference. The game also includes club emblems for many more European clubs as well as for major Dutch clubs such as PSV, AFC Ajax and Feyenoord, although there was no Dutch league of any kind (they were under the \"Rest of World\" header). This game also features, for the first time, the Swiss Super League, at the cost of excluding the Greek League. A card reward system licensed from Panini was also introduced where, after winning a particular competition, a star player card is unlocked. There is also a bonus game with the nations that had automatically qualified for the 2002 World Cup (France, Japan and South Korea), in which the player tries to improve the FIFA ranking of their chosen team by participating in international friendlies. \n \nMany of the international teams in the game are not licensed (some of them down to the players' names like the Netherlands), as well as smaller countries such as Barbados, who were only given numbers as player names. Also, to date, this was the last FIFA edition (not counting the World Cup versions) to feature the Japanese national team, since Japan Football Association would go on to concede exclusive rights to Konami's Pro Evolution Soccer series. \n \nFIFA Football 2002 ran for 10 years as the last FIFA to have only one person as cover, before Lionel Messi appeared alone on FIFA 13.","tags":[32,268435470,536870938,536870939]},{"id":43335,"cover":{"id":159606,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co3f5i.jpg"},"name":"FIFA 2003","platforms":[{"id":6,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"},{"id":8,"name":"PlayStation 2"},{"id":11,"name":"Xbox"},{"id":21,"name":"Nintendo GameCube"}],"screenshots":[{"id":418780,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc8z4s.jpg"},{"id":418781,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc8z4t.jpg"},{"id":418782,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc8z4u.jpg"}],"summary":"Master the fundamentals of soccer in FIFA Soccer 2003.
