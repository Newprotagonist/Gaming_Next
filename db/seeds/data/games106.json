Some of your enemies will cause chain reactions or change other enemies’ colors, so picking out the best shots will really help you survive and rack up those high scores!",

One of the fighters is controlled directly, while others move and shoot independently following the player\u0027s general orders. In a situation where all the soldiers in the squad have fallen, a player respawns with the next available squad. This decision makes Enlisted battles look massive and spectacular while keeping the input of each individual player in the overall team victory quite significant.",

The player can move along platforms, as well as jump to those above and to the side, similar to most platform games.\n\nThe player can also blow bubbles. These can trap enemies, who are defeated if the bubble is then burst by the player\u0027s spiny back. Bubbles that contain enemies can be popped at the same time resulting in different foods being projected around the level. Each enemy trapped in a bubble equates to a different food. Food is consumed and transferred to points (an increasing scale of 1000 points is awarded for each enemy burst in tandem with another meaning: one enemy burst equals one food item worth 1000 points, two enemies burst equals two food items worth 1000 and 2000 points, three enemies burst equals three food items worth 1000, 2000 and 4000 points, and so on), which results in earning lives. These same bubbles also float for a time before bursting, and can be jumped on, allowing access to otherwise inaccessible areas. Players progress to the next level once all enemies on the current level are defeated.\n\nEnemies turn \"angry\" — becoming pink-colored and moving faster — if they are the last enemy remaining, escape from a bubble after being left too long or a certain amount of time has been spent on the current level. A monster will also become angry if either player collects a skull (the only negative item in the game), and the monster is hit by the resulting comet crossing the screen (however, this is a rare occurrence).\n\nAfter a further time limit expires, an additional invincible enemy appears for each player, actively chasing them using only vertical and horizontal movements. These do not need to be defeated to complete the level, and disappear once a player\u0027s life is lost.\n\nContact with enemies and their projectiles (rocks, lasers, fireballs, etc.) results in death.",

Fictorum is an action role-playing game that features fully-destructible structures, a randomized node-based world map, and a satisfying magic system with on-the-fly spell shaping and customization. \n \nIn Fictorum, your mage wields real, legendary power right from the start—unlike those found in most magic-centric games. Our spellcasting and shaping system grants the player an unrivaled level of customization and reconfiguration. Up to three runes can be applied to a spell, each affecting a different spell characteristic, and can be changed to suit the player’s current need, interest, or whim. You might amplify ice blasts to freeze enemies in place, expand the radius of a fireball explosion to crumble a bridge and hinder pursuers, or chain a lightning attack together to strike several clustered targets. Shaping makes spellcasting tactical and satisfying; an experience more about tailoring your magical arsenal to effectively, efficiently, and enthusiastically destroy every obstacle. \n \nYet, challenge is abundant—the wizard must bring down a sprawling empire by himself. Your journey across the randomly-generated world map features locations chock full of enemies and structures to destroy.",

Winner of the Freeplay Award for Best Game Writing!  With hilarious dialogue, charming hand-drawn art and huge replay value, it\u0027s perfect for seasoned adventurers and casual gamers alike. \n \nWhen fugitive magician Lucas MacGuffin bungles a museum robbery, he finds himself magically bound to an ancient amulet and up against a city in full high-tech security lockdown. Suddenly dealing with the worst body hair problems he\u0027s ever had. As a human, Lucas is agile and cunning. Wolf Lucas would rather smash anything in his way.  Only by transforming between the two forms and cleverly utilising both sets of skills will he stand any chance of lifting his curse. \n \nAnd with the city\u0027s most powerful billionaire after his blood, a jaded Private Investigator on his (now-literal) tail and the rent long overdue, he\u0027ll need every ounce of ingenuity he manage. \n \nAlong the way he\u0027ll need to befriend a hilarious cast of characters, convince the city its most beloved citizen is a terrifying criminal mastermind, and hardest of all, teach his daughter it isn\u0027t funny to fill the fridge with dog food.",

Each version of Piety in any play-through is procedurally generated, with different houses, items and enemies placed each time the player enters the town.[4] Players must choose a location to fortify, build defenses and find supplies and survivors in thirteen in-game days before a zombie horde pours out of Indianapolis and overwhelms the survivors. The game began as a test for technology to be used in the upcoming game Northstar and uses a similar engine.[4]",

The difficulty of each tournament is determined by which cup you choose to race for. The first cup you race for is the Carbon cup, and once you\u0027ve beaten that you will unlock other cups that are based on elements like crystal, and diamond. Once you have won a tournament you will unlock a new cup to compete for, new levels to race in, and the chance to challenge other cars to gain access to them for use in Grand Prix races and vs mode. \n \nWhile Racing you can acquire weapons located around the tracks to help you finish the race quicker or to slow down your opponents so you can overtake them. The combat system is different from many games, except for having health and being destroyed for a limited amount of time, if you or an enemy is hit by a weapon you will be temporarily be slowed downed which gives your opponent time to overtake you. They\u0027re some weapons that can be avoided by using your cars jump jets; all cars have jump jets and can be used to avoid certain weapons, however not all weapons can be avoided even with the Jump Jets. \n \nThe weapons are: turbo boost, magnets, seeker-style missiles, a boomerang, time bombs, stingers, stoppers, rounds of bullets, and a shield.",

Its story is unrelated to the original FINAL FANTASY, and its gameplay is a major departure from the previous title for eliminating the traditional experience-based progression system.",

The game allows access to the SingStore, an online shop for downloading additional songs.",

Lethal Enforcers can be played with either a standard game pad or for more of an authentic arcade experience, the Konami Hyperblaster light gun.",

    "summary": "The story revolves around an interconnected cast of characters that possess a power which enables them to see and hear what a nearby character sees. The game was followed by a PlayStation 2 sequel, a reimagining for the PlayStation 3 and a film adaption.\n\nSiren is divided into stages, each taking place in one of ten areas in the village of Hanuda, and organized chronologically in a table called the \"Link Navigator\". In order to complete a stage, the player must accomplish a primary objective that usually involves reaching an exit point, subduing undead enemies called \"Shibito\", or finding an item. Objectives in different stages are interconnected via a butterfly effect, and a character\u0027s actions in one stage can trigger a secondary objective in another stage.\n\nThere are miscellaneous items scattered throughout each stage that give the player further insight into the plot\u0027s background. Once obtained, these items are archived in a catalog and can be viewed at any time during the game\u0027s duration. The game\u0027s player characters possess a psychic power named \"sightjack,\" which enables them to see and hear what a nearby Shibito or human sees and hears, and thus pinpoint its position, as well as gain knowledge of their activities and of the position of obtainable items. The clarity of each target depends on the distance from the player character. Once a point of view is located, it can be assigned to one of certain buttons of the controller to easily switch between multiple points of view. However, the player character is unable to move during use of the ability and is thus vulnerable to attack.\n\nThe game encourages the player to avoid Shibito rather than fight them. Characters can walk silently, avoid the use of a flashlight, and crouch behind objects to elude detection. Certain mission objectives require the player character to use items and/or the environment to distract Shibito from their activity, in order for them to achieve a goal. Others require the player to escort a non-player character. Player characters can also shout at any time in order to get the attention of nearby Shibito. Within most stages, the player character can hide in certain places such as cupboards and lock doors to prevent Shibito from entering. When a Shibito hears a sound made by the player character, it will search in the direction from which they heard the sound. If a character is seen by a Shibito, the latter will pursue the character to kill them either with a melee or ranged weapon or by strangulation. The Shibito will also shout to alert other nearby Shibito. Once the character has remained out of the Shibito\u0027s sight for a period of time, the Shibito will give up and resume its usual habits. Weapons are available for the player throughout the game, ranging from melee weapons to firearms. While Shibito can be knocked out in combat, they cannot be killed and will reanimate after a short period of time. If a character is injured, they can recover after some time has passed. Characters will lose stamina during combat and while running.",

Path your aircraft to safety, avoiding air traffic, fierce thunderstorms, and perilous landscapes. Get those planes refueled, repaired, and back in the air as fast as possible. You will need nerves of steel as you zoom down to “Toy Mode” to fight raging aircraft fires, man the guns and missiles of the battleship, and the worst task of all…Luggage sorting. But don’t waste any time, the skies are full of emergencies that only you can manage. Did we mention the Alien Invasion? Welcome to Final Approach.\n\nRoom-Scale VR: Never before has a game used the full capability and power of Room Scale Virtual Space! The sky is full of aircraft of every shape and size, from F16s to Blackhawk Helicopters, WW2 Spitfires and barnstorming bi-wings. We even threw in predator drones and stealth bombers for free!\n\nFinal Approach gives you complete control of the skies around the airports and islands as you tower over the world in what we call “God Mode”. Using the HTC Vive or Oculus Touch motion controllers, reach up and grab an aircraft, drawing paths from one side of the room to the other to get the aircraft to their designated runways. In addition to managing the aircraft, the player can use zoom points throughout the game to get up close and personal with various aspects of the terrain. Scale down to real world scale, where you can fight roaring fires with water hoses, interact the guns and missile launchers of battleships, sort luggage, scare of seagulls with air horns and solve puzzles required by the game.",

Each island has a setting and mechanic of its own. Puzzles, riddles, platforms, stealth and exploration are the ingredients of the adventure. Prepare to start a journey which you’ll never know what hides ahead. A journey whose paths must be wisely chosen.  \n \nChallenges you must face are based on different colors, shapes and sounds. Sometimes you can notice how game mechanics intertwined, being necessary to pay full attention if you want to advance in Niko’s journey.  \n \nMusic will evolve along with Niko, from happy and vivid melodies to sad and dark ones, the same way as the journey does. Music and sounds are key elements to stimulate both imagination and mood of the player. Don’t just play, feel the adventure as yours.  \n \nThe narrative develops as symbols and little tales deep within the scenario. We must explore it by ourselves to discover every detail of this fascinating adventure, fathoming the mysteries of Niko’s tale.",

All of the spots are different in their variety of species. You also get to pick your own lure, ranging from poppers and worms to jerk bait. All lures produce different results, so choose wisely. \n \nChoices for play include: the Beginner mode, where you are given a tutorial during which you\u0027re taught the rules of the game; Free Fishing mode, where you can just catch fish at your leisure; Tournament mode, where you must qualify at each of the three lakes to get to the main event; Versus Play, where you compete against another player; and World Monsters mode, where you fish for monster-sized fish through fake environments. \n \nBig Ol\u0027 Bass supports vibration feedback, analog control, one block of memory and the SLUH-00063 special controller.",

One leader however, a Commander Kron, seeks to unite the warring clans under a banner of vengeance... and together find some way to break out from this solar prison. \n \nThe game is space combat, done from a cockpit view. Different combinations of weapons can be equipped on your space fighter prior to launch. Missions take place in space as well as inside planet atmospheres. Various buttons cycle weapons, activate tractor beams, communicate responses and navigate your ship. In typical space combat fashion, you are equipped with 360 degrees of movement as well as thrust and braking options.

The objective of each track is to qualify for the next race by placing in the top three racers. Players collect items to improve performance, and they must avoid a variety of hazards such as rain puddles and oil slicks. It is an example of a racing game which features vehicular combat, in which racers can use missiles and bombs to temporarily disable opposing vehicles. \n \nThe game distanced itself from earlier racing titles by using an overhead, instead of a first-person, perspective. Reviews have cited it as inspiration for future games such as Super Off Road, Rock n\u0027 Roll Racing, and the Mario Kart series. It has appeared in many \"top games of all time\" lists and is regarded as one of the best titles in the NES library.",

Scans depict a roster of characters in line with the manga and anime storyline, featuring Nelliel, Nnoitra, Ichigo with his Hollow mask and Grimmjow\u0027s released form, (Pantera) to name a few. The gameplay appears to have been changed substantially, showing a split-screen during multi-player fights. It is a one-on-one fighter, but players pick a partner character for various team-up attacks and other maneuvers as well as being able to switch between them. It supports Wi-Fi play and can be played with the Classic controller or Gamecube controller in place of the Wii-Remote and nunchuk. Unlike other instalments before this, it is developed by Treasure Co. Ltd.",

Who is she and where did she really come from? The journey won\u0027t be easy, as she will have to conquer many obstacles and find out the hidden truths about the world she travels through, the friends she makes, the reigning monarchs, and the deities that are worshiped...   \n   \nThis is the first of many humorous and drama-filled chapters to come.   \n   \nPress the \"A\" key to Auto play the text.   \n   \nThis game is in 1920 x 1080 resolution, in window mode and full screen mode.   \n   \nSorry, Windows only. Unless you can find a way to play .exe files on something else.   \n   \nAlso, be careful, as the game can crash when you close it, as Visual Novelty, the program I used to create this game, is still in its Beta stages. Be sure to save often, just in case. This is the main reason I place this game under \"Unstable\"   \n   \nCredits   \n   \nOriginal Story and Character Art by me, Kassidie Butler (Viridea) 2015   \n   \nMusic by Audionautix and AngelHeights   \n   \nSFX by Freesound.org   \n   \nBackgrounds from Pixabay   \n   \nBackgrounds edited with FotoSketcher   \n   \nand Adobe Photoshop CC 2015   \n   \nThank you very much, and I hope you enjoy the game!",

The game\u0027s original release date was moved up by months, which resulted in the development team cutting some planned game features.\n\nThe game\u0027s plot involves the player saving the galaxy by manufacturing droids with specific abilities, such as the ability to see in the dark or jump, to complete missions. The educational portions of these missions teach players about concepts such as energy, force, motion, simple machines, light, and magnetism.\n\nStar Wars: DroidWorks received high praise from critics, sold well, and won numerous awards and accolades.",

    "summary": "The Valkyria, the embodiment of death, is returning to the battlefield in Valkyria Revolution, and players will have to do - and sacrifice - whatever is necessary to liberate their homeland. With an engaging story full of political intrigue, a battle system that mixes real-time combat and tactical strategy, a gorgeous visual style, and more, the game will immerse players into the frontlines of a desperate war.\n\nIn the wake of a revolution, Jutland\u0027s elite soldiers, the Vanargand, must band together to defeat the Ruzi Empire and stop death itself - the Valkyria. This grizzled anti-Valkyria squad is equipped with advanced mana weaponry and has the powerful ability to wield ragnite spells to combat this terrifying threat. The unit is comprised of soldiers who have a high affinity for ragnite, and even Jutland\u0027s own Princess Ophelia has joined the ranks. The princess carries the utmost love for her country and has answered the call of duty to liberate those who are suffering from the Ruzi\u0027s tyranny. However, Amleth , the commanding officer of Vanargand, hides a terrible secret. Is he friend or foe to the country he has sworn to protect?\n\n- Story About War and Liberation - Taking place in an alternate world based on the European era of industrialization, players will band together with Jutland\u0027s elite soldiers, the Vanargand, as they fight against the merciless Ruzi Empire. However, things may not be as black and white as they seem.\n\n- A Revolution in RPG Combat - Though it bears the Valkyria name, Valkyria Revolution eschews the original series\u0027 traditional turn-based strategy for a new hybrid of fast paced real-time combat and tactical acumen across battlefields. Balancing deadly attacks and cunning strategy will be the key to victory.\n\n- A New Painterly Look with a Vibrant Soundtrack - The world of Valkyria Revolution is brought to life by the unique visual style provided by a new graphical engine and a vibrant soundtrack composed by the celebrated Yasunori Mitsuda (Chrono Trigger, Stella Glow).\n\n- Languages - The powerful drama can be experienced in its original Japanese voice acting with English subtitles or in a brand-new English dub!\n\n- Limited Edition includes a 12 song Soundtrack (CD)",

In addition to the popular pen \u0026 paper adventures, TDE has also inspired a series of successful computer games. The Dark Eye: Chains of Satinav immerses players deep in the world of Aventuria, where they experience an amazing story and explore lands never before featured in a TDE computer game.\n\nIn Andergast, whose inhabitants are considered to be notoriously superstitious, King Efferdan awaits a state visit from high-ranking dignitaries. For centuries the kingdom has been at odds with neighboring Nostria, but now first steps are being undertaken toward a lasting peace. But a plague of crows troubles the king, for the birds are acting with unusual aggressiveness, even attacking humans. Moreover, there are those among the citizens of Andergast who swear that the crows are bringing them dark nightmares. As the belligerent creatures infiltrate even the castle itself, the king seeks a skilled bird catcher - an opportunity for young Geron to prove that the reputation for ill luck that has followed him since childhood is undeserved. Following an audience with the king, the prestigious task is assigned to him. However, not only does his task prove unexpectedly difficult, but it also turns out to be the first step of the greatest adventure of his life, which will lead him to the borders of the charted lands of Aventuria and beyond.",

    "summary": "Dancing Stage EuroMIX is the 2nd release of the Dancing Stage series, the European version of Dance Dance Revolution series of music video games by Konami. The arcade version was released in 1999, followed by the Sony PlayStation version in 2001. An updated \"Internet Ranking\" version of the arcade machine was released later on, containing 6 new tracks (as advertised by a sticker on the game\u0027s name banner).  \n  \nTo date, Dancing Stage EuroMIX is one of only two European home versions of the Dancing Stage franchise to coincide with an arcade game, the 2nd one being Dancing Stage SuperNOVA. \n \nThe game is based on the same interface and engine as the Japanese game Dance Dance Revolution 3rdMix, except with a songlist that is a cut-down hybrid of Dance Dance Revolution 2ndMix and Dance Dance Revolution 3rdMix\u0027s songlists, with the addition of 8 European-exclusive songs (28 tracks and can be expanded to a total of 34 tracks with Internet Ranking enabled). Unlike Dance Dance Revolution 3rdMix, the home version of Dancing Stage EuroMIX does not feature \"Edit Mode\" and does not use a PC Card., a feature in which the player can create their own custom routines to songs featured in the game. This also means that the arcade version does not feature PlayStation-compatible memory card slots. The game\u0027s console port was released for PlayStation on June 1, 2001 and contains 24 songs. It removes the Dancemania licenses and all but one song added in the Internet Ranking version, but adds five Konami Original songs.",

    "summary": "bit Generations: Orbital is a Game Boy Advance video game released exclusively in Japan as part of the second series of bit Generations titles. It is an innovative title that has the player consolidating a multitude of planets together in each stage to create on large rock. It was remade on WiiWare under the title of Art Style: ORBIENT, and was the first of at least three titles to be released in the Art Style series. \n \nGameplay \nBefore starting a stage the player will have to choose which galaxy he or she wishes to play within and then the stage. Following this your small star will shoot towards a large body with a varying amount of small stars orbiting it. The goal is to come in possession of those other stars in order to increase the size of the primary one. When ready, the player will shoot out of the orbit of a star and then be pulled into another one when he enters its range. If the player touches the star that the smaller ones are revolving around, then your star will blow up. With this said, it\u0027s suggested you constantly adjust the speed of your stara as not to rush into an orbit, ultimately causing it to crash. \n \nWhen one wishes to enter the orbit of a star, he\u0027ll have to press the A button, which is will \"attract\" your star towards it. If you don\u0027t want to enter it, then you\u0027ll have to press B, which will repel it. If the player wishes to change the position of the camera, then they can use the d-pad. \n \nWhen not in orbit around a star, you\u0027ll simply be floating. This is when you have to use a combination of the attract and repel buttons in order to change your direction. If you\u0027re going near a large star, then its orbit will effect the player more than a smaller one would, and you have more of a chance to start revolving around it. \n \nThere are multiple obstacles in the game that are represented by the color red. Basically if it\u0027s red, you want to stay away from it. unfortunately using the repel or attract button will have no effect when you\u0027re next to an obstacle, though if a star is nearby and you\u0027re heading straight towards an obstacle, it\u0027s suggested that you get out of its way. Sometimes these hazards will even revolve around stars.",

Lionel Messi is featured as the cover although Andres Guardado features on some versions. A new game mode called Become A Legend has been brought in which involves creating a player and taking him through a career. The Master League mode now has two-tier negotiations which involve negotiating with the club first and then the player separately. Also the edit mode was notably improved with badges and kits now being as intuitive as they were on PS2 versions.\n\nAlthough the game is generally viewed as an improvement, the Online Mode and the omission of players such as Danny Alves, Tomas Zapotocny and Walter Lopez drew plenty of criticism.\n\nThe game will be followed by PES 2010.",

    "summary": "Meteos Wars is a falling block puzzle game based on the Nintendo DS game Meteos. While the basic gameplay is identical in design, controlling with a gamepad instead of the touch-screen \u0026 Stylus pair makes it a different game. It consists of a board where coloured meteos plummet towards a planet\u0027s atmosphere. There, they form columns that the user can manipulate. The player moves a red cursor with two buttons to slide the meteos up or down. When three or more are lined up horizontally or vertically, they turn into ignited stone and are launched into space (the top of the screen) boosted by rockets. There they also catch all incoming meteos and often chain combos together. Ignitions based on vertical matches provide a more powerful ignition. As a group catches more incoming meteos, it becomes heavier and gravity pulls it down. The player can avoid that by causing secondary ignitions, either directly in the group or from below. If meteos can be lifted past the top of the screen, they fall down into the opponent\u0027s board. The game is over when a player\u0027s board is filled up entirely. \n \nAn additional button can be used to speed up time, creating time bombs to be sent into the opponent\u0027s board to cause an explosion. Meteos can also turn into ash and drop back down. When there is a full gauge at the bottom of the screen a planet impact can be caused. There are four types (Armageddon, Gambit, Sentinel and Tempest) each with different effects. Respectively, they lower the attack power, send more meteos while receiving less, fire a meteos missile, and fire lasers to clear away falling meteos as an additional means of defense. \n \nThe single-player has three game modes: a versus battle against the computer, mission mode, and attack mode. In the mission mode different planets need to be defeated before reaching Meteo. It is possible to unlock new planets and accessories along the way. Multiplayer against a human player is available both offline and online."
