The object of the game is to enter a maze and collect all the coins and, if possible, any other treasure that may appear. The thief must then exit the maze (a vault) without being apprehended by the Super D (policemen).

The game's story takes place in the year 2632, five hundred years after humanity left the solar system. Under Earth's rule, 11 different star systems have now been terraformed and colonized. However, there are a number of groups who object to Earth's rule and desire independence; four of them have joined forces and formed a rebel group called the ADAN Freedom Alliance. The main characters in the story are Katana Faraway, Ellen Bernstein, and Margras Mason; all are young pilots having just joined the Earth's military, the Terra Central Armed Forces (TCAF). Following a suspicious accident, Margras joins the opposing ADAN forces to fight against his former friends and home planet. You control Katana in the game, and as missions are completed the story progresses.\n\nWhile previous Silpheed games utilized a top down view of the action, Project Sylpheed features a fully 3-D view from either just behind your ship, or a first person view from within it. During the game you'll need to complete a series of missions; these are varied and include having to destroy all opponents in an area or defend an allied ship from attack. Initially there are fewer enemies and you don't have powerful weaponry, but as the game progresses the enemy increases in count and abilities and you can upgrade your ship with more powerful weapons. During a mission several sub-objectives may also become available which can be completed (some of the sub-objectives also unlock Xbox 360 Achievements when completed).","tags":[18,268435461,268435469,536870936],"videos":[{"id":32839,"video_id":"MXH-3LwLF5o"}]},{"id":35619,"name":"The Hero of Kendrickstone","platforms":[{"id":3,"name":"Linux"},{"id":6,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"},{"id":14,"name":"Mac"},{"id":39,"name":"iOS"}],"screenshots":[{"id":87111,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/wow5n5ei9xmfudl9olfm.jpg"},{"id":87112,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/a98zeigc0ylmig5hpmpo.jpg"},{"id":87113,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/xet3tro3gtklu5qk6smf.jpg"},{"id":87114,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/uvln8eyip9orfe3ytnwe.jpg"},{"id":87115,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sitojrwzswdxb6fnsqet.jpg"}],"summary":"As a wanna-be hero, you must rescue a city held hostage by an evil wizard, and somehow find money to pay your rent!

Next to the story mode, there is the Z battle, the VS battle, Maximum, Free battle and Practice mode. The game has three difficulty levels. In team battles the player can tap the touchscreen to select another fighter. Touch can also be used to perform a powerful combined attack when it is available.\n\nThe sequel moves away from the level system of the first game, where reaching a new character level led to upgraded statistics, or new sprites and attacks. This is replaced by individual characters that become available when a sufficient amount of Dragon Points is available.","tags":[268435460,536870990,536871019,536875053,536875054,536875074,536875199,536875265,536875291,536875292,536875525,536875717,536877000,536877005,536878458,536879681,536880286,536881603,536883265,536885284],"videos":[{"id":9341,"video_id":"t39gR_o18To"}]},{"id":31239,"cover":{"id":33860,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/ium9u0pvtttg1sislejh.jpg"},"name":"Total Extreme Wrestling 2013","platforms":[{"id":6,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}],"screenshots":[{"id":76596,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/rowbnuixspdiy4yztscm.jpg"},{"id":76597,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/z4tkfutfdldzmk1zillh.jpg"},{"id":76598,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/yx3ap8g63a9ozjcabw5w.jpg"},{"id":76599,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/txxlzjiofs24qu4zpzls.jpg"},{"id":76600,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/b2y3nevwpz20c0iwqjhy.jpg"}],"summary":"Step into the ring.\nYou're the promoter and it's your job to crush the competition by assembling, managing, and leading a roster of wrestling stars to victory.","tags":[268435469,268435470,536871146,536871906,536872060,536872078]},{"id":842,"aggregated_rating":70.0,"cover":{"id":692,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/t7xcxbtpnrs1gnbgwlc5.jpg"},"name":"Rally Trophy","platforms":[{"id":6,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}],"screenshots":[{"id":137929,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/odregjh2ws4gwhr4vqxk.jpg"},{"id":137930,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/zfge0cjjpqaw30e4hymq.jpg"},{"id":137931,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/wecpvn6aqiwak0tyase1.jpg"},{"id":137932,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/h4gtjvn8ujmzg93j3mzm.jpg"},{"id":137933,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/nx2ebx95k71xbt6rtpyp.jpg"}],"summary":"In the game, the player is taken through 42 highly detailed stages in five countries - Russia, Sweden, Finland, Switzerland and Kenya - which cover several road surfaces including gravel, mud and tarmac.

Though the Arabian troops do not require any weapons to produce, they are rather expensive. The game was also released as Stronghold Warchest. This version was a compendium of Stronghold and an enhanced version of Stronghold: Crusader, containing additional characters and an additional Crusader Trail. \n \nStronghold Warchest was only released in limited number of countries (i. e. USA or Poland), meaning players in the rest of the world have never encountered the second Crusader Trail, or second set of characters. This changed when an updated version of Stronghold Crusader, Stronghold: Crusader Extreme was released in early 2008.","tags":[1,17,22,39,268435467,268435469,268435471,536871063,536871139,536871470,536871506,536871906,536872015,536872060,536872074,536872383,536872419,536872658,536872914,536873066,536873089,536873473,536875067,536875096,536875229,536875231,536875265,536875304,536875324,536875440,536875525,536875531,536875679,536875760,536875775,536875778,536875803,536875891,536875901,536876007,536876281,536876315,536876330,536876334,536876373,536876399,536876413,536876972,536876977,536877423,536877586,536877611,536877679,536877816,536877870,536878323,536878532,536879783,536880121,536880177,536880292,536880294,536880430,536881641,536881643,536881651,536882045,536883035,536884029,536884045],"videos":[{"id":652,"video_id":"oAs7Nt1oi9w"}]},{"id":17289,"aggregated_rating":40.0,"cover":{"id":130562,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co2sqq.jpg"},"name":"Loot Hero DX","platforms":[{"id":6,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"},{"id":48,"name":"PlayStation 4"},{"id":49,"name":"Xbox One"},{"id":130,"name":"Nintendo Switch"}],"screenshots":[{"id":95864,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/dyovke6bdxozpom5t8dw.jpg"},{"id":95865,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/dvwxvelhqw7magsyhhg2.jpg"},{"id":95866,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/noletrbsdsouiovevoet.jpg"},{"id":95867,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/cf1cwssnowkgy36glrnw.jpg"},{"id":95868,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/mmltvjkutkoek9qdixhu.jpg"}],"summary":"A legendary Dragon is haunting the lands.

A shooting game featuring two-dimensional (2D) graphics, the game is set on a fictional planet where the player must defeat waves of invading aliens while protecting astronauts. Development was led by Eugene Jarvis, a pinball programmer at Williams; Defender was Jarvis's first video game project, and drew inspiration from Space Invaders and Asteroids. Williams planned to display the game at the Amusement & Music Operators Association (AMOA) trade show, though development delays resulted in the team working on the game up until the show started.\n\nDefender was commercially successful, selling over 55,000 units to become the company's best selling arcade game. Praise among critics focused on the game's audio-visuals and gameplay. It is frequently listed as one of Jarvis's best contributions to the video game industry, as well as one of the most difficult video games. Defender was ported to numerous platforms, inspired the development of other games, and was followed by sequels and many imitations.","tags":[1,18,268435461,268435471,536871075,536871078,536871208,536871882,536871904,536871971,536872205,536874694,536876005,536876120,536876215,536876281,536876354,536876362,536876435,536877277,536877451,536879840,536880319,536880841,536881831,536885518],"videos":[{"id":15471,"video_id":"ndjFSmI4EN8"},{"id":50002,"video_id":"ZEV7G2CqOTo"}]},{"id":180573,"name":"Cyber Rescue: Virus Eruption","platforms":[{"id":6,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}],"screenshots":[{"id":682760,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scemtk.jpg"},{"id":682761,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scemtl.jpg"},{"id":682762,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scemtm.jpg"},{"id":682763,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scemtn.jpg"},{"id":682764,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scemto.jpg"}],"summary":"Race through cyberspace to destroy the source of your friend's virus.","tags":[1,18,268435461,268435466,268435470,268435488,268435489,536870990,536871874]},{"id":15561,"cover":{"id":96588,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co22j0.jpg"},"name":"The Hip Hop Dance Experience","platforms":[{"id":5,"name":"Wii"},{"id":12,"name":"Xbox 360"}],"screenshots":[{"id":176046,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/inu343wadq7n8nftp33q.jpg"},{"id":176047,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/fbvmbj3xykbfpnzxoaer.jpg"},{"id":176048,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/izfmbfd4umdp0ydt7j44.jpg"},{"id":176049,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/ffkkvcpyxhxzmxtarmst.jpg"},{"id":176050,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/wfkchfvyjpb249sfqtyn.jpg"},{"id":176051,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/tkf5iyshbraj12kzsxda.jpg"},{"id":176052,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/pasd7vajlrgy0yeermrg.jpg"},{"id":176053,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/cbxgqc3r1jjdn3n2wter.jpg"}],"summary":"The Hip Hop Dance Experience is a dancing game for the Wii and Xbox 360 published by Ubisoft.

Playboy: The Mansion is a social strategy game that calls on players to build a virtual empire of wealth, celebrity, and freedom from puritanical repression and intolerance. This is accomplished by developing a fully functioning Playboy mansion, to attract and accommodate influential celebrities and beautiful young models who are willing to strike the right poses. Players who can build a suitably entertaining and well-equipped mansion, while adhering to \"the Playboy philosophy,\" are rewarded with \"the Playboy lifestyle,\" surrounded by powerful trendsetters, influential pop idols, and sexually liberated young women. In short, the game invites players to take the role of a virtual Hugh Hefner. \n \nAs Hef, players will be responsible for keeping the Playboy brand relevant to its ever-evolving audience. One good way to do this is by attracting celebrity friends to the mansion, and making sure they have a good time when they visit. With enough money, players can build new facilities -- like swimming pools, movie theaters, or tennis courts -- which may have special appeal to particular celebrities. It's also a good idea to introduce these V.I.P. guests to Playmates who share their interests. The game's main interface should be familiar to Sims 2 players; characters are directed through their 3D domestic environments with mouse clicks, and clicked objects offer pop-up menus of available interactions. \n \nCoaxing powerful celebrity friends to appear in an issue of Playboy magazine can boost circulation, bringing in more income for future developments. As Hef, players can determine the content of each issue, choosing the articles, essays, cover shots, and centerfolds. They'll also have an opportunity to direct the photo shoots, choosing the location on the mansion grounds, the model, and the wardrobe selection -- all of which feature a \"topless\" option. The game includes a structured campaign that follows Hefner's real-life rise to international celebrity through a series of individual scenarios that focus on building the fame, circulation, and clout it took to develop the Playboy brand into what it is today. Players design their own challenges in the \"Empire\" mode, where they can set their own goals and victory conditions.","tags":[28,268435469,268435471,536871255,536871270,536871938,536872873,536874694,536875054,536875281,536875326,536875338,536875364,536875436,536875556,536875802,536876642,536877386,536877802,536877913,536878324,536878531,536880294,536880295,536880353,536883035,536884207,536897444]},{"id":36831,"aggregated_rating":63.1666666666667,"cover":{"id":87538,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co1vjm.jpg"},"name":"Dissidia Final Fantasy NT","platforms":[{"id":48,"name":"PlayStation 4"}],"screenshots":[{"id":43929,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/tqhjpy1tkl9o0bvilsq3.jpg"},{"id":43930,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/l2ra4vhi1jqmr2ejtfwf.jpg"},{"id":43931,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/phw7kbq4naf4loinodvg.jpg"},{"id":43932,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/edl978uv5tvpr8p6jq6r.jpg"},{"id":43933,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/aprjqzficgdbdgdtvckl.jpg"}],"summary":"In partnership with Team Ninja from KOEI TECMO GAMES, Square Enix presents DISSIDIA FINAL FANTASY NT as a new and refreshing experience – a team-based brawler. \n \nCombining seamless gameplay, FINAL FANTASY characters and breathtaking worlds from the past 30 years of the franchise, DISSIDIA FINAL FANTASY NT welcomes all gamers to the online battle arena with its renowned bravery combat system. \n \nDISSIDIA FINAL FANTASY NT allows you to choose from over 20 legendary FINAL FANTASY characters and battle in a 3-versus-3 arena.

Weapon power is also divided into long and short range, i.e. a ship that is very good at long range combat may have poor close ranged weapons etc. During combat, the following actions can be chosen from a menu: Movement, Attacking, terrain information, unit information, a map of the battlefield, overview of all units, including those of the enemy; and an option to scout planets for technology. When an attacking unit is within range of an attacked unit, the attacked unit will always counter-attack (if it isn't destroyed first). In later missions it becomes possible to scout planets for technology and upgrade ships, as well as take control of space stations to build new ships. Ships cannot be taken into the next mission however.","tags":[18,268435471,536870936,536871327,536872494,536872634,536873311],"videos":[{"id":20172,"video_id":"zgmOAaJoatA"}]},{"id":7222,"aggregated_rating":62.5,"cover":{"id":95424,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co21mo.jpg"},"name":"Two Worlds","platforms":[{"id":6,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"},{"id":12,"name":"Xbox 360"}],"screenshots":[{"id":24399,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/pgii0zpgc35he7zjordq.jpg"},{"id":24400,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/txqsnazdpgzuowidkxxu.jpg"},{"id":24401,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/ititras4836fqwdxahon.jpg"},{"id":24402,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/x31f1b0mdalffzjzx7ky.jpg"},{"id":24403,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/bbc0il60umwhtvioyrsq.jpg"}],"summary":"This is a fantasy RPG.\nAt the beginning of your epic adventure, a mercenary task takes you to the far north - but you're also following up a mysterious lead at the same time - the first clue you've been given since Kyra's disappearance.

The story begins as Valaimian troops advance into Nightweld, a peace-loving kingdom.

Needless to say, this is just the beginning of a dire and perilous journey for the unwitting Fazz.\n\nAs you and your party trek across the world map, you'll take part in various battles. Ready-for-Action Points (RAP) determine which, as well as the number of actions that can be performed by a particular character. The more actions performed (and thus, more RAPs expended) during a turn, the longer you'll have to wait for your next chance to act. When attacking, an interactive gauge appears that does damage based upon where the slider is stopped. Stopping it at the very end will result in greater damage dealt to the enemy.

This is less true to real pinball gameplay, but it speeds up the game's pace and gives more power to the player to influence the movement.","tags":[1]},{"id":34067,"cover":{"id":32443,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/jxv3eeh5arcptswxzv6d.jpg"},"name":"Street Warriors Online","platforms":[{"id":6,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}],"screenshots":[{"id":77125,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/tbdnbqjrokx5m9dauoy1.jpg"},{"id":77126,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/un1gbovfgbz3mrcmdltp.jpg"},{"id":77127,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/qac4x9fkukfpkwgzlttg.jpg"},{"id":77128,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/mcejmivhpvtzvi3mkgls.jpg"},{"id":77129,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/teg8wjitwubdwhgmrthl.jpg"}],"summary":"First, realistic PvP brawling game for up to 8 vs 8 players with original, dynamic combat system and fast, round based battles. \nCreate and develop Your character.

It is developed by Pyro Studios and published by Eidos Interactive. \n \nReleased during the first months of 2006, the game makes a departure from the first four games. Although the missions are set up in a similar fashion (several different objectives, some to be achieved through stealth, others through use of force) and in most occasions the player is allowed to change between different characters, this is the first game in the series to apply a first-person perspective, like many other World War II-inspired games, in contrast to the overhead view of the earlier games. Hence, the game is far more similar to the Medal of Honor or Call of Duty games than to earlier entries of the series.","tags":[1,22,39,268435461,536870914,536870931,536871044,536871213,536871365,536871378,536871510,536871937,536872070,536872285,536872352,536872695,536872733,536873753,536874743,536874906,536874947,536875046,536875095,536875137,536875242,536875257,536875271,536875342,536875358,536875420,536875491,536875523,536875572,536875624,536875688,536875738,536875803,536875804,536875814,536875820,536876181,536876262,536876395,536876565,536876586,536876687,536876798,536876800,536876911,536876938,536877161,536877239,536877264,536877307,536877433,536877501,536877536,536877537,536877679,536877801,536877808,536877928,536877950,536878034,536878317,536878326,536878470,536879591,536879607,536879610,536879634,536880294,536880540,536881347,536883028,536883035,536883260,536884021,536884125]},{"id":29434,"cover":{"id":222706,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co4rua.jpg"},"name":"Tales of Terror: Crimson Dawn","platforms":[{"id":6,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}],"screenshots":[{"id":66661,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/yytpsxwkei4kour15n3z.jpg"},{"id":66662,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/cc39urastt5fkku9dkib.jpg"},{"id":66663,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/dukzpsybvxv2fjw8urou.jpg"},{"id":66664,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/luacxd2kar41ntlqos7m.jpg"},{"id":66665,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/hlqmvglw998wr8rz0vg0.jpg"}],"summary":"Rescue your abducted brother from eternal darkness in this thrilling Hidden Object adventure game!","tags":[268435487]},{"id":21530,"aggregated_rating":52.5,"cover":{"id":16344,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/hukynfjequ0i1lnsitud.jpg"},"name":"Art of Fighting Anthology","platforms":[{"id":8,"name":"PlayStation 2"},{"id":48,"name":"PlayStation 4"}],"screenshots":[{"id":28919,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/rm2wmo7lya3jhcdwdhf5.jpg"}],"summary":"A compilation of arcade ports of the Art of Fighting games, originally realesed by SNK in their Neo-Geo platform.

Zero: Black-Haired Shrine Maiden) in Japan and Project Zero: Maiden of Black Water in PAL regions, is a survival horror video game developed by Koei Tecmo and published by Nintendo for the Wii U. The fifth main entry in the Fatal Frame series, it was released in Japan in September 2014 and worldwide in October 2015. As with previous games in the series, players navigate areas filled with hostile ghosts which must be fought by taking photographs using the Camera Obscura, which is directly controlled using the Wii U gamepad. A post-endgame story featuring Ayane, a character from the company's Dead or Alive series, is also available featuring altered gameplay mechanics. The story, which is set on the fictional Hikami Mountain, focuses on three protagonists who are drawn into supernatural events revolving the area, including an ancient ritual to seal away Yomi, a malevolent force corrupting the surrounding spirits that is tied to the fate of the titular shrine maiden Ouse Kurosawa.\n\nPlanning for the game began in 2011, during the projection of the Wii remake of Crimson Butterfly. The game was first proposed by series co-creator Keisuke Kikuchi when he saw the Wii U hardware and the possibilities of the gamepad becoming the Camera Obscura. The game was a joint production effort between Koei Tecmo and Nintendo Software Planning & Development, with Kikuchi and fellow co-creator Makoto Shibata returning as to their respective posts of producer and director, together with staff from the previous series entry Mask of the Lunar Eclipse and developers new to the series. The cast went through several revisions during development, while the staff experimented with the capacities of the new hardware. As with previous games, it features a theme song by Tsuki Amano. Upon release, the game received critical acclaim for its use of the gamepad and dark atmosphere, while opinions were mixed on its story, portrayal of its female characters, and other aspects such as its pacing and controls.","tags":[1,19,21,268435465,268435471,268435487,536870928,536874662,536888099,536888539],"videos":[{"id":45277,"video_id":"4lDC5wC3OMw"}]},{"id":20412,"aggregated_rating":63.5,"cover":{"id":161197,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co3gdp.jpg"},"name":"Dragon Ball: Origins 2","platforms":[{"id":20,"name":"Nintendo DS"}],"screenshots":[{"id":33295,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/voyzdpzxgsp1ahazetbf.jpg"},{"id":33296,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/yucmq4yxtete4eltkibj.jpg"},{"id":33297,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/mjq5swf1hnfg5fdspdun.jpg"},{"id":33298,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/pbplnfbjpard1rnyj0lk.jpg"}],"summary":"In Dragon Ball: Origins 2, players battle through the Red Ribbon Army saga covering Goku’s first encounters with the nefarious Red Ribbon Army up to the resurrection of Upa’s father, a member of the native tribe who serve as the guardians of the mystical Korin Tower.

Similar to the series, the player's time accuracy will also be rated on a similar scale and manner that will be displayed on the bottom of the screen.
