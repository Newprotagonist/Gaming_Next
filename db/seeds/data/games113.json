    "summary": "Civilization III: Conquests is the second and final expansion for the award-winning and best-selling computer game Civilization III. It was published in 2003. This expansion added eight new civilizations to the game, and including the eight civilizations from Play the World this brings the total number of playable civilizations up to thirty-one (the maximum supported by the game). The new civilizations are the Byzantines, the Dutch, the Hittites, the Incans, the Mayans, the Portuguese and the Sumerians. In addition to these playable civilizations, graphics for the Austrians are present in the editor so one can replace an existing civilization. \n \nTwo new special traits are added in this pack: seafaring and agricultural. Many of the new civilizations take advantage of these new traits (e.g. the Sumerians are Scientific and Agricultural), and some old civilizations are changed to more appropriate ones (e.g. the English have been changed from Expansionist and Commercial to Seafaring and Commercial). \n \nNew governments have also been added to the game, Feudalism and Fascism, and new Wonders of the World such as the Statue of Zeus and the Mausoleum of Mausollos. Four new bonus resources have been included, two of which provide food bonuses to previously unprofitable terrain. Oases can now be found in deserts, tropical fruit in jungles, sugar on plains and hills, and tobacco on grasslands and hills. In addition, two new types of terrain have been added. These are marshes and volcanoes. Players cannot construct cities on marshes, and cannot improve volcanoes in any way. Like jungles and flood plains, cities that have at least 1 citizen working a marsh may succumb to disease. Volcanoes may periodically erupt, destroying all improvements and cities and killing any units in some or all adjacent squares. \n \nThe centerpiece of this expansion pack, however, was the inclusion of scenarios, intended for multiplayer gaming. Unlike the main (\"epic\") game, these scenarios took much less time to play, and focused on a specific period in history. \n \nGenerally the reception of this expansion pack was much better than that of Play the World. \n \nOne year after Conquests was launched, the latest Civilization III stand-alone version, Civilization III: Complete was also released. This version included Civilization III, Play the World and Conquests. This version also includes several patches. \n \nTwo years later, in 2005 Civilization IV was released.",

    "summary": "This sequel to the hit 2002 action role-playing game set in the Dungeons \u0026 Dragons universe picks up right where the original left off. The mysterious disappearance of the Onyx Tower and death of Eldrith the Betrayer had left the noble heroes trapped in an unknown setting. Yet the harbor town of Baldur\u0027s Gate is still very much part of a heinous plot to control the Forgotten Realms. Five new character types vow to stop whoever or whatever is behind this new alliance, no matter what the cost.\n\nUsing the 3rd Edition Dungeons \u0026 Dragons rules set, Baldur\u0027s Gate: Dark Alliance II features four new acts of hack-and-slash combat and powerful spell casting. Even more monster types will engage in real-time battles using the same overhead perspective as witnessed in the original game. Each selected character can parlay the experience gained from combat into acquiring new feats and enhanced abilities over time. To help in battle, a new item creation system lets players craft magical weapons and armor using raw materials found during their travels.\n\nAs before, two heroes can join the adventure in cooperative play on the same screen, with each character differing in the types of feats and powers under his or her command. Equipment can be found or purchased from local merchants using the gold looted from felled creatures or received as payment for quests. Baldur\u0027s Gate: Dark Alliance II also features a number of hidden areas, secret characters, and literally hundreds of items to find and use, including potions, scrolls, and wands. In addition, the game features a new branching storyline that offers players a choice where to go next for fortune and honor.",

Prophesied as an infant to become either \"the darkness to destroy the world\" or \"the light which saves it\", Sandra carefully watches over him and never allows him to leave Rolandia\u0027s capital city, Rosaria, or have any contact with the outside world. However, throughout his childhood Carmaine experiences strange and vivid dreams of people and places he knows nothing about. When at last he becomes old enough, Sandra tells him it is time to go out and explore beyond the city gates. Accompanied by Tippi, his tiny fairy-like companion, he leaves the city to discover his destiny.",

    "summary": "This game is the first volume of a series of compilations of MSX computer games released by Konami only in Japan. It was also released on the Sega Saturn.\n\nThis compilation includes the classic games:\n\n- Konami\u0027s Boxing (1984):\nA boxing game with a couple of moves, with the standard jabs complimented by body punches and the ability to dodge, duck or raise your guard. Each punch weakens your opponent\u0027s strength, although going long enough without being hit can see this begin to recover. A rain of blows can produce a quick knockout, but in general you must hit him many times, and then with a knockout blow, to see him go down. There is a referee. The game has a two player option.\n\n- Konami\u0027s Ping-Pong (1985):\nFrom Konami\u0027s coin-op, Ping Pong recreates the fast-paced sport of table tennis. To win each match you must get to 10 points with a 2 point lead - if the scores reach 10-9 the game goes on until someone has a 2 point lead or reaches 15, in a similar manner to tennis. There are nine skill levels to beat, with increasing abilities as the game goes on. The human player has the advantage of serving first, and as the serve reverses every five points, you are guaranteed to have more chances to serve than your opponent (remember the significance of 10 and 15 in the scoring). The points system rewards long rallies and large winning margins, as you get points for each hit, for each point won, and for each point of the winning margin.\n\n- Hyper Sports 2 (1985):\nThree tough events await in this joystick-waggling action game. The full sequence of events is - skeet shooting, archery and weightlifting. You must complete each event in order to be allowed onto the next one.\n\n- Mopiranger (1985):\nThe peaceful land of the Mopira have been invaded by the Razons. In this platform game you \u0027ll play Mopiranger and you have to save the young Moplits, who have been kidnapped by the dastardly Razons. The levels are build in a maze-like pattern in which you have to find and rescue the young Moplits from the hostile Razons. Using the obstacles present in the game you can block the Razons, but also lock yourself in...\n\n- Antarctic Adventure (1984):\nAs a penguin, you must travel around Antarctica, making your way between bases before time runs out. This sounds easy, right? Wrong. Hindering your progress will be ice crevices and leopard seals. You can jump over the crevices, but jumping over the leopard seals may be difficult. You can speed up or slow down the penguin to avoid both of these hazards. The bases include Australia, France, New Zealand, USA, Argentina, UK, and Japan. You can collect flags and eat fish for points. Collecting a flashing flag will allow you to wear a propeller that enable you to fly over those hazards.\n\n- Yie Ar Kung-Fu (1984):\nBased on the popular arcade game, Yie Ar Kung-Fu follows Oolong\u0027s quest to become a Kung-Fu master. Of course this involves fighting a wide range of opponents in a traditional one-on-one 2D environment. Oolong has a wide range of attacks he can use to lower his opponent\u0027s life bar, including traditional punching and kicking attacks as well as jumping ones. Opponents are well armed with unique weapons and attacks, so Oolong\u0027s task won\u0027t be easy.\n\n- Road Fighter (1985):\nA top view racing game. You have to reach the finish line before time runs out. Don\u0027t crash into the wall, cars or trucks. Because if you do you will lose gasoline. You can get additional gasoline by picking up fuel items. Especially avoid the purple cars, they do change lanes! And remember... oil makes road slippery...\n\n- Sky Jaguar (1984):\nVertical shooter. When a weakened and vulnerable Earth is invaded by the vicious Zephyr army, the planet\u0027s only hope is a fleet of powerful ships, the Sky Jaguars. It \u0027ll take sharp reflexes and amazing skills to survive the Zephyrians\u0027 unrelenting assault... can you last long enough to discover and destroy the enemy\u0027s hidden headquarters?\n\n- Gradius (1986):\nThe people of Gradius are in trouble. The ameoboid Bacterions have launched an all out attack against the planet, and it\u0027s up to you to fly into battle and save them. Along the way you\u0027ll be able to power up your ship with hyper speed, force fields, lasers, missiles, double beam cannons and more to help you battle. Based on the arcade game, Gradius is a side scrolling shooter. Shooting certain enemies will leave a power up pod behind which can be collected to add more power to your ship. Each level features a wide variety of enemies trying to stop you, with a large boss at the end. Gameplay is for one player or two players alternating.\n\n- Gofer no Yabou: Episode 2 (1988):\nAlso known as Nemesis 3 - The Eye Of Destruction. Gradius 3 is a vertical scrolling shoot \u0027m up. Shooting at certain enemies will leave a power up pod behind which can be collected to add more power to your space ship (for example special weapons or a force field). Every level features a wide variety of enemies trying to stop you, with a large boss at the end. Gameplay is for one player or two players alternating. In Gradius 3 the planet Gradius is involved in 3 space wars: versus Bacterion, Venom and Salamander!",

Most of the systems you would expect such as sonar and periscope are featured and nicely presented in VGA. The game offers ten missions for both the Soviet and American side in a Cold War scenario, that grows progressively hotter. Nice to see that the two sides\u0027 submarines have their own graphic sets in the game, even with some pseudo-cyrillic labels on the Russian side.",

Make sure you land on the pad near the end. \n \nIn part two, you start out in the jungle and must jump from rock to rock without crashing into toucans (shoot at them to make them fly higher) and being blown to bits. Then you have to make your way to the general\u0027s offices shooting soldiers on the way, and finally, locate the secret documents. When you complete the seven sections of Army Moves, you\u0027ll receive a higher bonus. \n \nSome versions have a high score table to record your achievements.

Strider Returns is not considered a part of the series, as it was not developed by Capcom, it was exclusive to the west, and most people hated it. Strider 2, on the other hand, was very well received. Unfortunately, despite being hailed by critics and series fans, Strider 2 did not sell well. \n \nThe Playstation version of the game included the original Strider on a separate disc, for those who had never played it to become accomodated with the series. In the United States, there was a printing error for the game that swapped the labelling of each CD, so the Strider 2 disc was labelled Strider, and the Strider disc was labelled Strider 2.",

Though player names could not be used, the fictional ones make it apparent who each player represents. For instance, you can strike out one of Oakland\u0027s Bash brothers (M. Bash or J. Bash) with Texas\u0027 R. Nolan or hit a home run with Detroit\u0027s C. Fieldman off of Chicago\u0027s M. Gaddox.\n\nThe gameplay of Roger Clemens differs from that of most NES baseball games. Though the batting scenes may resemble those typified by R.B.I. Baseball and Major League Baseball, the view switches to what one might see from the outfield stands once the ball is hit. This results in different controls from most baseball games as well.\n\nA player can challenge a friend or the computer, and one-player games may be exhibition or part of a 33-game season, complete with playoffs once the season is complete. In order to help make your season a successful one, Roger Clemens himself is there to offer advice.",

Your fields can be cultivated with machines from CLAAS and even your animals have to be taken care of. \nThe complete Agricultural Simulator allows you to ride many genuine CLAAS tractors. Choose between many different models of tractors, combines, extensions and hangers. Sell your products and invest in better equipment. More powerful machines will help you farm bigger areas. \nAs striving farmer, you have to invest carefully to maximize the crop. Don’t kick over the traces or you won’t be able to upgrade your farm and buy more land. Choose the right seed from different types of grains like barley, rye, or wheat or decide to grow canola or corn. The harvest can be used as animal food, new seed as well as product to be sold on the market. Always have an eye on the market prices so you don’t come out with losses after all the work. \nGet another main pillar and breed cattle: cows, horses, sheep, hen, and geese. You may even have game animals on your farm and sell them profitably as food. If everything works well, the animals will prosper and you can sell their offspring on the market. Take care of proper feeding, daily care of the stables, and your animals well-being. Hire workers to balance your workload and invest in their further education. \nThe career mode in Agricultural Simulator guarantees a lot of fun. Playing cooperative mode allows you to manage your farm either online or offline with your friends.",

Special items that reveal coins, upgraded armour, full vitality, extra lives, extra time, or simply bonus points may be found by attacking certain walls.

    "summary": "The game is the sequel to R-Type, which was first released as an arcade game in 1987 and profoundly influenced later shooting games with its charge shots, unique weaponry, and grotesque enemies. Hudson Soft ported the later 4 levels of the original R-Type to the PC Engine with the title R-Type II, but the Hudson release is unrelated to the game described in this article.\n\nThe player controls a ship called the R-9C (or R-9 Custom), which is an improved version of its predecessor game\u0027s ship; the R-9. The ship\u0027s design was changed slightly, and the wave cannon was given homing capabilities. Two new types of weapons (the Search Laser and Shotgun Laser) were added, bringing the total number of weapon types up to five. A new anti-ground unit bomb was also added to the missile inventory.\n\nThough the number of levels was decreased from the prequel, the number of enemies, their durability, and the number of bullets they shoot were greatly increased. Enemy movements and terrain were also made trickier, bringing the game\u0027s difficulty up considerably. The same revival system is used as in the prequel, where the player is brought back to a checkpoint whenever their ship is destroyed.\n\nThe controls are mostly unchanged from R-Type, where the 8-way joystick controls the ship\u0027s movement, and the shot button fires the ship\u0027s main beam. The other button is used to equip or unequip Force; the series\u0027 most unusual innovation. Pressing down the shot button causes the blue beam gauge to fill up, and releasing the button causes a wave beam to travel a certain distance depending on the length of time the button was pressed down. If the button is pressed down until the blue gauge is fully charged, a red gauge appears and fills up quickly. Filling up the red gauge causes it to flash blue and red, releasing the shot button at this point shoots an even more powerful beam.\n\nUnlike the normal beam that only travels in a straight line, the newly added Shotgun Laser beam explodes in multiple directions after traveling a short distance. This shot causes heavy damage if the player can target a single enemy with it. However, holding the button down after the gauge is flashing causes the beam to return to the normal transverse beam (the gauge alternates between flashing and returning to the normal state while the button is held down), so the player must release the button at the right timing in order to successfully target enemies. The other newly added beam, the Search Laser, is semi-homing, and can bend at angles up to 45°.",

    "summary": "While King Maximus ruled the land, life was good in the four continents. The Sceptre of Order rested safely in his hands, keeping at bay the forces of darkness that infested the world. Children were happy. Merchants prospered. Honest folks made honest livings. And nobody complained much.\n\nBut far across the waters, Arech Dragonbreath, leader of the Dark Legions, looked enviously upon the wealth and splendor of the four continents. With the aid of great magic, Arech stole into the chambers of King Maximus and wrested the Sceptre from the grip of the sleeping King. He then released his evil forces, ordering his minions and lieutenants to seize the land in whatever manner they pleased (as long as it involved considerable amounts of pain and terror). Arech retired to his new lair on the four continents and waited for King Maximus’s certain resistance. The King and his forces, however, offered none. Fearing some kind of trickery, Arech peered into his prophetic crystal to see what Maximus was up to. The crystal showed the King lying in bed, his face pale and gaunt like death itself. \n\nOver the King stood a noble young knight with the strength and resolve of great leader. The King was speaking. \"Come here\" he gasped, \"I am weak and breath is a luxury. Please.\" He extended his hand and the great leader drew close. \"You must restore my kingdom. I, too, must be restored. I am tied to this land and as it dies, so do I. My days here are numbered. You must recover the Sceptre if I and my land are to live.\"Arech watched this exchange and quickly buried the Sceptre somewhere on the four continents. He draw a map of its location, then shredded it into 25 pieces. He gave one to each of his 16 villainous nobles, kept one for himself, and the other eight he hid with powerful artifacts around the four continents. \n\nYour time grows short, leader. You have your quest and King Maximus’s last hope. May you be guarded in your journey by the Spirits of Order. Good luck!",

The levels consist of solid blocks, and breakable blocks. The players can break a block by dropping a bomb nearby. The bomb explodes only in vertical and horizontal directions, and any solid block will stop the explosion in that direction. Initially the bomb has a very limited range, and only one bomb can be placed at the same time. However when destroying breakable blocks, power-ups may appear. The most common power-ups is extending the range of your bombs, and the increasing the supply of bombs. Other power-ups include freezing all monsters, gaining increased speed, becoming invisible. Most of these are only temporary. \nDeathmatch has similar rules except that no monsters are present. The objective is to kill all other human players.",

They were even secure enough in their isolated compound that they had a daughter five years after the zombie-like grays appeared.\n\nLife carried on as normally as it could, until another refugee on the run is killed during a nearby attack. Her son is saved and taken in by the Williamses -- who do not realize that this kind action will destroy their home and threaten their entire family. They find themselves caught in the midst of a struggle between two eldritch horrors, and the path to survival is anything but clear.",

Each stage is packed with ghosts and ghouls to put you on edge; and you\u0027ll be armed with a flashlight and a vacuum cleaner to help you capture your foes.

Flubs cannot be harmed through punching alone; only a well-placed trap or punch that send a Flub flying into dangerously placed lethal hazards can score kills. Players can utilize a one-button, multi-directional punch system to knock opponents back and to maneuver around levels. Tapping the button delivers a short-ranged, light punch. Holding down the button charges up your Flub and allows for a powerful punch that sends you and your opponent flying. In addition to punching, players can collect items during a match to hinder opponents. Items can be thrown directly at opponents, or be placed on the environment as traps. To achieve victory, players will need to outsmart opponents and stay on their toes in the face of dangerous, hazard-filled environments.",

In Harry\u0027s second year at Hogwarts, the ancient Chamber of Secrets has been opened, and what lurks within is attacking students. To get through this ordeal alive, Harry must again complete various challenges. These mostly consist of navigating large mazes, fighting monsters, solving puzzles, flipping switches and pressing buttons for doors to open. As Harry is often in places he shouldn\u0027t be, stealth sequences are also a large part of the game. To avoid teachers and prefects, he can sneak around slowly and hide behind curtains. If he is caught, he is thrown out and house points can be deducted. Finally, Quidditch is also back in this game, this time in three-dimensional space, viewed from the back.",

The game is set in 1912. You play as Booker DeWitt, a disgraced former private detective who\u0027s picked up a new case. Your goal is to find Elizabeth, a young woman who\u0027s gone missing and return her unharmed. The only problem is that she\u0027s being kept on this flying city. Columbia was once a symbol of America\u0027s success as a nation, floating around the world as a traveling World\u0027s Fair, a marvel of human innovation. But strange things have happened since Columbia\u0027s unveiling in 1900, and now the city has disappeared into the clouds. DeWitt knows how to find it, but over the years stories have been told about Columbia having unlawful heavy armament and deranged citizenry. Do not expect this to be a pleasure cruise.",

Instead of letting her talents go to waste in prison, the FBI decided she’d be better off working for them, so she was put to work in the cybercrimes unit at 18 years old. Being stuck in a boring, dead-end job never sat well with Kinzie. She wanted action, excitement, and above all an outlet for punishing people violently. While she knows LEGION is a dangerous organization which needs to be stopped, she probably wouldn’t care as much if she wasn’t allowed to go out in the field.\n\nAs an agent of MAYHEM, she gets high-tech gadgets, weapons, and a license to beat down anyone who gets in her way … or who she thinks may need a good kick in the ass. Also, the ability to spy on so many interesting individuals in the agency keeps her pretty happy during her downtime.",

Despite fueling the engine of the British Empire, workers’ lives are little more than legalized slavery while the top few percent profit from their labor. Living poor and dying young, the lower class unite in protest as a new kind of family, gangs, who turn to a life in the underworld in their struggle to survive. A struggle, until watchful Assassins come to their side and re-ignite an age-old conflict involving London’s leaders that will echo throughout modern history, from the underground up.\n\nIntroducing Jacob Frye, who with the help of his twin sister Evie, will change the fate of millions in Assassin’s Creed® Syndicate.

There are two games included in this special digital collection. Shelter 2 (with the Mountains DLC included) follows the life of a mother Lynx; it’s a journey of parenthood in which nurturing your cubs is paramount for survival.

You need to raise them safely until they reach adulthood, with a different experience and circumstances each time you play. Paws: A Shelter 2 Game is a standalone experience based within the same world. In this poetic adventure you need to explore and survive the wilds as a cub, interacting with the environment and forging a surprising alliance. It features puzzles, a special soundtrack and plenty of memorable moments.

    "summary": "Nocturne in Yellow is a fantasy medieval first-person shooter using an extremely modified version of the idtech1 engine, also known as the Doom engine. In it, you play as a dude marching through ancient castles with the realization that every myth and story ever made in the history of man is true and all of them are pissed off at you for having a pulse and four functional limbs.\nYou utilize a bow, some grenades, and a spear in order to fend them off, wandering deeper to stop the rise of the dark lord threatening to spread death, destruction, and hurt feelings all around.\n\nBeing a first-person shooter, you step into the eyes of a protagonist and wield whatever weapon he was smart enough to grab before wandering off on this death quest. Primary fire, well, fires whatever weapon you\u0027re using, while secondary fire lobs a grenade at whatever looks funny at you.\nRun around through seven maps, picking up items and stabbing dudes before reaching a boss at the end, and then stab the boss. Boss drops artifact, pick up artifact for more powers for your bow, and then move on to the next level to repeat as needed. After you do this seven times, you win!\nIf you play on Story Mode, occasionally there will be long walls of text about people talking about their feelings. If you play on Arcade mode, all of the boring text will be stripped out, leaving you free to stab enemies without hearing about their failed love life.",

A prison riot occurs and an experiment goes horribly wrong. The people inside the prison - except for Nick, who seems to be immune - get infected with a substance called Abuse that transforms them into monsters. Nick takes a laser gun and goes on to single-handily destroy all mutants, stop the substance from spreading further, and escape from the prison complex.\n\nAbuse resembles a side-scrolling platform game. The game is marked for its unusual control scheme: The keyboard is used to move Nick, while the mouse is used for aiming the weapons. The basic gameplay consists of fighting various enemies (mostly the various forms of mutants, who prefer to attack in huge swarms) and solving some simple puzzles, most involving switches.",

    "summary": "Gears of War 2 is a 2008 military science fiction third-person shooter video game developed by Epic Games and published by Microsoft Game Studios for the Xbox 360. It is the second installment of the Gears of War series, with lead design by Cliff Bleszinski,. The game was officially released in North America, Europe and Australia on November 7, 2008 and was released in Japan on July 30, 2009. The game expands technically on the previous game by using a modified Unreal Engine 3 engine. The development team brought in comic book writer Joshua Ortega to help write the plot for the game. \n \nIn Gears of War 2, the COG continues its fight against the Locust horde, who are attempting to sink all of the cities on the planet Sera. Sergeant Marcus Fenix leads Delta Squad into the depths of the planet to try to stop the Locust during the assault upon Locust territory. The player controls Fenix in the main mission campaign, with the ability to play cooperatively with a second player controlling Fenix\u0027s best friend and fellow Squad member Dominic \"Dom\" Santiago. The game includes several existing and new multiplayer modes including five-on-five battles between human and Locust forces, and a \"Horde\" mode that challenges up to five players against waves of Locust forces with ever-increasing strength. New weapons and gameplay mechanics such as \"chainsaw duels\" and the ability to use downed foes as \"meatshields\" were added to the game. \n \nOn its release weekend, Gears of War 2 sold over two million copies, and within two months of release, had sold four million copies. It was the seventh best selling video game of 2009 and received several accolades. The game received similar praise as its predecessor, with the new gameplay and multiplayer modes seen as outstanding additions.",

Famitsu revealed that the battle system featured four party members, and was more team-oriented. The game also features more of a sci-fi emphasis than past titles with the ability to control your own ship. This ship is quite large, and is able to land on at least 5 planets or other space-based destinations. Players are able to travel through the \"star ocean,\" jumping across planets. The game takes place a few centuries before the original Star Ocean (around S.D. 10, or approximately 2087 AD). The game\u0027s plot revolves around Edge and his crew combating a mysterious threat called the \"Grigori\".\n\nAn international version of the game was released by Square Enix as a worldwide PlayStation 3-exclusive on February 9, 2010. Officially known as Star Ocean: The Last Hope International, the game contains both Japanese and English voices as well as new content that is exclusive to the international version of the game.",
