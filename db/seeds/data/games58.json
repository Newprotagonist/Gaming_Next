Known as ‘Angels’ by the people and beloved for their bravery, Angels protect the peace and ensure a good life for all. \n \nHowever, the gates of Hell are overflowing, allowing monsters to cross the planes and attack human beings.

Unlike other shooting games, Deathsmiles is designed with a left/right shooting mechanic, surrounding you with enemy units and gunfire from both sides of the screen. The player will need to employ strategy and think about enemy positioning as your shots may be blocked by obstacles. \n \nDeathsmiles features a selectable difficulty level that allows you to choose how to proceed through the game, ensuring that newcomers are as welcome as veterans.

The quest begins in the Keystone Monastery, on a sideroom near the area where you meet the Injured Monk. An NPC called \"Mysterious Monk\" wearing a mask will appear, and you will have an option to talk to him and assist him in finding the signs Antanas has left behind for others to follow into the Citadel. \n \nThe NPC will give you the trinket Guide of Antanas, which you must equip to complete the quest. Once equipped, head up towards the gate you opened near the Injured Monk and out into the bridge with the three infested enemies. After dealing with them, check the sides of the walls for faded runes that you can now interact with by pressing triangle. Activate the symbol and continue forward towards the area where you obtain the Gauntlet. Look to the sidewall of the stairs and activate a second rune, then a third on the other end of the gauntlet bridge."

    "summary": "The first three games are played on a hexagonal grid for a map. Players not only control the combat units (ranging from infantry and tanks to helicopters, fighters and bombers, armored trains, surface warships and submarines, stationary gun turrets), but (especially in the later games) also many support logistics units (ammo and fuel transports, scout and radar units, road and construction vehicles, and others). Units have various weapons and can gain experience (which in later games can be transferred over in a campaign). Fuel and ammo is limited, and logistics require careful attention. Players also control buildings, where units can be repaired, and sometimes, produced. Weather conditions change, affecting unit movements (for example, a sea or river can freeze, immobilizing ships but allowing light units to move through it). Fog of war is prevalent and players have to use scouting units to gain information about the battlefield. Some of those options were added in expansions or sequels. \n \nPlayers have various tasks, ranging from eliminating all opponent forces to capturing specific buildings or protecting certain units or places. In some missions events from outside the battlefield can suddenly change the situation, giving players new objectives, reinforcements, allies or enemies. In some battles there are more than two sides, each with their own objectives, not all of them directly involved in hostilities - some of them can be even allied. At the same time, those allegiances can change because of some events or actions. \n \nBattle Isle one had the screen divided into two parts, one for each player. The turns were also divided into move and attack phases. While one player moved his units, the other commanded his own troops to carry out his actions. Battle Isle 2 gave the player the entire screen, and merged move and attack phases, and introduced the 3-D display of combat. Battle Isle 3 was very similar to Battle Isle 2, with improved graphics, more units and a new storyline. Battle Isle: The Andosian War was entirely set in the 3-D environment and combined elements of real-time and turn-based strategies. \n \nThe AI is relatively weak, relying on mass frontal assaults. After a player survives the first few turns and the AI\u0027s overwhelming numbers using protected artillery and terrain advantage, the computer is usually unable to mount a proper defense.",

One of the most important aspects of professional basketball is being able to drive to the lane and have a player make it look like he\u0027s going up for a shot so that he can draw defense, but then pass the ball to an open man on the inside or to a wide-open player out on the perimeter. Indeed, generally driving through the lane can be a little problematic since the AI tends to latch onto players in the paint, and the juke moves can be difficult to use effectively against tough opponents.",

However, for one little ghoul named Mortia, things are about to take a dive out of the ordinary. After a smooth-talking skeleton challenges her to a game of darts, she wins the most unbelievable prize she\u0027s ever laid eyes on: a live goldfish! \n \nA moment later the skeleton has fled, leaving Mortia with the task of finding her fish Spooks someplace safe to be \"alive.\" If she doesn\u0027t help her little Spooks, and soon, he may die. \n \nApparently, this is rather unpleasant."

The new game offers 20 licensed tunes, including Lady Gagas classic Bad Romance, Paramores CrushCrushCrush and the classic Celebration from Kool and the Gang. There are also more than 30 specially-created tunes from KONAMIs in-house team, all of which are designed to test the players co-ordination and rhythm. \n \nWith a wealth of game modes - including the eternally popular Calorie Counter system so users can watch the pounds drop off as they dance! - DanceDanceRevolution hottest party 4 is a stunning party game that absolutely anyone can enjoy.",

It has been regarded by many as a spiritual successor to Scythe rather than a direct sequel. While the original featured small, action-packed levels, Scythe 2 is filled with large, complex and detailed maps, and is sometimes compared to the style of Alien Vendetta.",

This was the Pacific campaign, one of the bloodiest, toughest-fought campaigns in all of recorded history. Though all of the forces involved were essential parts of the eventual outcome, naval aviation played a special part. The carrier forces of both sides proved their worth time and again.\n\nThe idea behind 1942: The Pacific Air War is to re-create some of the adventure of that time and place and give you a chance to take part in it. To succeed, you have to avoid that oil- and blood-soaked, fire-on-water grave long enough to be of service to your country or your Emperor. As a commanding admiral of the navy, a crack fighter pilot, or just an anonymous Joe tail gunner, you are going to fight for recognition and just plain survival. The Japanese are moving south and east like a steamroller, trying to take control of the Pacific. The Americans are fighting back, desperately hoping to drain the strength from the Japanese juggernaut.",

The game, which was loosely based on \"The Demiurge\" episode, was being developed by Cryo Interactive and published by Viacom New Media. The game first made an appearance at E3 that same year, with Æon Flux creator Peter Chung on hand to promote it, and commercial advertising was even included in the 1996 VHS release of the animated series.\n\nViacom was dissolved when Spelling Entertainment realized it had two video game divisions. Spelling folded Viacom into Virgin, which then canceled all working and planned Viacom titles – Aeon Flux being one of them.\nMeanwhile, Cryo reworked the game into a title called PAX Corps, which was released in Europe to poor reviews. No US publisher has signed on to bring the game here.\nAlso worth mentioning is the fact the GT Interactive has acquired the rights to the Aeon Flux license, though no game has been announced to date.",

    "summary": "PGA European Tour is a golf game that makes use of the official European Tour license. It offers only four courses, specifically Quinta do Lago in Portugal, Kungsängen in Sweden, Druids Glen and the K Club in Ireland. Players can choose to play a quick match, a non-tour golf game or participate in the real tour. The non-tour option includes several modes: in Strokeplay players need to get the least number of strokes in order to win, in Matchplay the goal is to win more holes, while in Skins holes are played for money (winners of holes one to six get 100 euros, seven to twelve - 200 euros, thirteen to eighteen - 300 euros). Up to four players can play non-tour games, and some options allow teams of two to face each other.\n\nParticipation in the tour itself is a simulation of the real thing. Players start as amateurs, and can select to play as one of 64 European golfers like Nick Faldo and Jose Maria Olazabal, or create their own custom character. To reach professional status it\u0027s necessary to reduce the handicap to zero and finish in the top 8 of the Amateur Challenge Tour. Reaching the top 8 of the Professional Challenge Tour guarantees an entry to the European Tour Qualifying School, the final hurdle before advancing to the European Tour. In order to keep playing there one must not fall out of the top 32 golfers in the rankings.",

Your character will level up and can even buy a house to live in, form parties to take on quests as a group. The game was created using RPG Maker XP. The original version of the game ships with Midi music; however, players can replace these with a downloadable high-quality live version."

Slide into an inside-the-cockpit view, battle against multiple enemies, and practice your aerial combat and evasion maneuvers to prove your air superiority. You can play in either Arcade or Simulation mode, each affording you a unique experience. Arcade mode offers looser controls that make things easier for rookie pilots, while experts will want to jump right into Simulation mode, which will challenge the ability of even the most experienced flyboy. Head into multiple missions of dogfighting action and perform aerial tricks that will break the sound barrier, but don\u0027t think that it\u0027s all fun and games. When the mission\u0027s complete, you\u0027ll have to carefully land your jet on an aircraft carrier.",

Draw routes between these stations to connect them with subway lines. Commuters travel along your lines to get around the city as fast as they can. Each station can only hold a handful of waiting commuters so your subway network will need to be well-designed to avoid delays.\n\nThe city is growing. More stations are opening, and commuters are appearing faster. The demands on your network are ever-increasing. You\u0027ll be constantly redesigning your lines to maximise efficiency. The new assets you earn every week will help immensely — as long as they\u0027re used wisely.\n\nEventually your network will fail. Stations will open too quickly. Commuters will crowd the platforms. How long the city keeps moving is up to you.",

    "summary": "Las Aventuras de Chocu - The Video Game is a two-dimensional platform game starring one of the most beloved characters in Spanish folklore: Chocu. In this hectic adventure we will have to find the mythical primeval chocopoc, which lies hidden in the old waterfall. But our company will not be easy.\n\nControlling the Chocu is a real delight. We can move from side to side of the screen with the arrow keys, jump with the \u0027s\u0027 key, and attack with the \u0027d\u0027 key. We can also interact with some elements of the scenarios by pressing the \u0027f\u0027 key. And of course, to move through the menus we can use the mouse directly.\n\nAlthough jumping through the jungle in search of chococopos is fun, the strong point of Las Aventuras de Chocu - The Video Game is without a doubt its script. Both the dialogues and the game\u0027s own story are hilarious, with a multitude of jokes capable of getting us a good laugh. Special mention deserves its dynamic achievement system, which will accompany us throughout the game.\n\nThe Adventures of Chocu - The Video Game is an excellent platform game, which has a cast of characters full of charisma and a lot of useless objects that we can buy and sell in the store of our friend the giraffe.",

Hunt deer with a shotgun, a rifle, or a bow, using slightly different tactics with each. If you want to be successful, you\u0027ll have to use real-world hunting strategies. Search for droppings or other signs of movement to find the best area to wait in. Once there, use one of an assortment of tools to help you catch your prey: mask your odor with a cover scent, use a tree stand to camouflage yourself, or lure the deer with a powerful musk, a deer call, or an antler rattle. It\u0027s up to you to decide how to catch the deer; some methods are more efficient than others, so you\u0027ll have to find the one that works best for you. Detailed graphics and digitized sound round out the experience for would-be hunters.",
