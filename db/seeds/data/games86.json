She has to find a way to stop the cursed beasts awakened after sleeping for a thousand years and coming to life for reasons unknown. Lost Lands: the Golden Curse is an adventurous hidden object game-quest with puzzles and mini-games scattered through the boundless spaces of the fantasy world – from the volcano valleys to the Druid forest, from the deep caves to the floating islands. One fine day an ordinary good-looking housewife, Susan, while visiting the museum of arts drops by an old looking glass which, for whatever reason, starts to beckon her up. When she touched the looking-glass, Susan was immediately transported into a magical fantasy world of the Lost Lands. She has been known for her heroic deeds as Susan the Warrior there. Susan meets a child named Fiora, and the girl takes Susan to her great-grandfather, Maaron. Susan recognizes the Druid as an old acquaintance. Maaron explains that the village was attacked by a Harpy, the legendary winged beast. The strangest thing is that the demon has been a stone statue in the abandoned old fort for thousands of years. Along with her friends Susan is ready to set forth into a volcano, go to a dungeon and climb floating islands to find out the reason why the Harpy, Naga, the Minotaur and Solidus, one after another, began coming to life from the stone prison and causing chaos in the Lost Lands. Naturally, the creatures must be stopped...…",

However, if the character is extremely close to an enemy, he will throw out his fists to attack - a precursor to the characters featured in Metal Slug, who use knives in close combat.\n\nMuch like the cartoon, Bucky O\u0027Hare features colorful animation, and voice actors from the series were hired to participate in the game\u0027s cut scenes.\n\nThe player chooses from five protagonists: Bucky O\u0027Hare, the heroic rabbit captain of the space ship Righteous Indignation; Jenny, an \"Aldebaran cat\" and telepath; Dead-Eye Duck, a four-armed mallard; Willy, a kid from earth that replaced their engineer, and Blinky, a one-eyed android. As in the television series, the characters must stop the Toad Empire from invading extraterrestrial planets and enslaving their peoples; to do so they must shoot their way through an army of brainwashed toads to destroy their evil leader, a computer program known as \"Komplex\" and release the \"Interplanetary Life Force.\"\n\nThe enemies, among them Al Negator, Toadborg, Total Terror Toad, a \"Cyborg Spider\", the various varieties of Toad Storm Troopers, the Toads\u0027 Air Marshall, and \"Komplex-2-Go\" who featured in the comic book and cartoon series continuities.",

Conceived by Bandai Digital Entertainment, Countdown Vampires is one of those clones -- you will maneuver 3D characters throughout 2D backgrounds in a series of fixed camera angles while fending off unspeakable horrors. \n \nAs a police officer, Keith J. Snyder has been assigned a security position at the grand opening of Desert Moon -- a hotel casino with a horror theme located in Casino City. While overseeing security and making sure VIPs aren\u0027t being hurt at the dance club, something goes horribly wrong. As a sudden fire causes sprinklers to go off, the water turns black and transforms the dancers into murderous vampire monsters. Assuming the role of the brave police detective, a civic servant and the last remaining human alive, Snyder must unravel the mysteries of the black water while defending himself against multiple monstrosities. \n \nArmed initially with a tranquilizer gun, a shock glove and an unlimited supply of vampire-destroying white water, Keith J. Snyder will find and utilize twelve weapons and items throughout the course of his adventure. Also located throughout the hotel casino are computer terminals, maps of the area and vending machines in which helpful items are sold; at computer terminals, he can access an e-mail program that furthers the storyline. \n \nIn Countdown Vampires, Snyder\u0027s physical health is represented by a color-based condition gauge found in the inventory screen; green indicates a healthy body, yellow represents wounded and red coloring is fatal as Snyder approaches death. You can heal the character using various health items found throughout the casino. In addition to looking out for your character\u0027s health, you will solve various puzzles and seek out specific keys and cards for locked doors.",

Find depth in the unique ways each character’s attacks compliment the others and “pass the punch” to create a unique ultimate attack, which changes based on which characters combine their powers. With so many punches to pass, high scores to hit, hoops to shoot, secrets to discover and extra content to unlock, Pass The Punch will keep players busy until they are TKO’d.",

Find many items to enhance your character and his abilities while you descend down into the Meganoid space ship. Do you rush for the exit, or do you take your time to collect everything there is, barely escaping the security drones that will hunt you down if you linger. Key features: - Levels randomly generated on every game session, based on a set of templates, making the levels unique but familiar at the same time. - A platformer with “roguelike” elements. Consumables, alternate routes, procedural generation, and many devices and gadgets add depth to the challenging gameplay of the original Meganoid - A lot of collectible items that will change the main character’s abilities to navigate the world. Find a jetpack to start flying around, find anti-gravity-boots to perform double jumps, and much more. - Hidden bonus area’s to find and unlock. Often providing you with a short-cut or very rare and powerful items. - A hackable game world. Finding green key-cards allows you to modify how certain elements of the game act and respond to you. Stop rocket-launchers from working, make rockets fly less far, make destroyed robots drop extra lives. In true Meganoid tradition, you’ll die a lot in many different ways, but you’ll learn to overcome the difficulties, learn how the Meganoid world operates, and eventually get to the bottom of it!",

Take your pick from a selection of maps to fight your battle. \n \nDestroy your enemy \nMake quick decisions on the battlefield using your units to round the enemy to crossfire, suppress the enemy with a barrage of bullets or by using explosions and high firepower to your advantage by scaring the hostile units.

Starting with a single planet and a small number of space-worthy vessels, you must venture forth into the galaxy, conquer new worlds, build new colonies and defend your very existence against those who would take what is yours. How you play is your decision. Use diplomacy or brute force. Trade, spy and research your way to galactic domination. Make friends, or create mortal enemies…\n\nThe heart of StarDrive is its ship design and combat engine.\n\nStarDrive takes a modular approach to ship design, allowing the player to create custom ships where the composition and placement of ship modules really matters to the performance of a ship.. In combat, if your portside armour is taking a beating, then rotate around and show them the starboard side! Hide behind a friendly capital ship’s shields; warp into and out of the fray, launch fighters, lay mines, and so much more.",

The game is an arcade action title, but is unusual in that there are three distinct segments of gameplay, each of which affects the one following it. \n \nIn the first segment, Illuminar stands fixed in the middle of the screen. Moving the joystick controls his \"wisp\", a magical boomerang-like device. Pressing the fire button plants a seed that will slowly grow into a tree in several stages to adulthood. Ogres appear from both sides of the screen, walking across it horizontally. If they walk over an immature tree, the tree shrinks back one stage of growth, eventually disappearing. Spiders periodically appear and move randomly about the screen. If they move over a fully grown tree it becomes poisoned, and will eventually die. Both enemies can be vanquished by touching them with the wisp, which will also cure poisoned trees. Eye-Pods containing additional seeds periodically appear and can be picked up with the wisp. The speed of the action increases continually through the level until it becomes quite hectic at the end. \n \nEvery tree that survives the first level becomes Illuminar\u0027s ally in the second. Here the player enters a five-level side-view map of a crypt filled with spider eggs. Using the wisp, the player selects trees and moves them over the coffins where their roots grow into the roof of the coffins and eventually break through to crush the eggs lying below. If they take too long, the spider will hatch and attack the trees until the wisp kills them. Periodically the Hands of Fate descend from the roof, picking up anything below them and sometimes dropping prizes. The player must move through the crypt while all of this takes place, capturing question-mark prizes in order to extend ladders needed to reach lower levels. On this level, moving the joystick normally moves Illuminar, but holding down the fire button freezes him in place and moves the wisp instead. \n \nThe final confrontation between Illuminar and Tetragorn takes place in a graveyard. Gravestones appear that must be destroyed by walking over them in order to prevent Tetragorn from appearing. When he does - and there are always enough gravestones to ensure this - he shoots off trails of fire that injure Illuminar as he moves about. Any spider eggs that were not destroyed in the crypt also turn into spiders that attack Illuminar. The wisp can be used to banish either enemy, although while it is in use, Illuminar remains fixed in place. \n \nEach hit by any enemy on Illuminar reduces his power and eventually kills him, although the periodic appearance of small rings of power will improve his life power again.",

Its name was the “Seventh Chord”. Having excelled in manipulating magic (rune) in combat using her life force and living in secret from society, Freya was the only girl who has shown excellent results as a knight.\n\nFreya was summoned to the island of eternal summer, where she was born and raised, by Julius, Seventh Chord\u0027s commander and her elder brother who she reunited with after being separated for a long time, for her first mission. And that mission, was said to have never been accomplished in history; it was to “defeat a mythical god”. Although it was handed down as a legend before, the \"God\" that was subdued was revived in this present day and age once again.\n\nAfter analyzing the \"abilities\" of these mythical gods, the organization created the “strategic creation technology weapon” to fight against them. This ultimate scientific weapon, known as “Miracle”, was handed down to Freya, to challenge these mythical existences to a fight.\n\nThe enemies have transcended human intelligence, and their immortal existence has the ability to recreate the \"powers\" of a mythical god. The seven “Mahoutsukai”.\nThe seven people who gathered in the name of justice. The \"Kisekitsukai\" of the “Seventh Chord”.\n\nUltimate Science (justice) vs. Mythical Magic (another justice)\nA fight that no one had expected. Before long, the truth will begin to lead one to a sad fate.\nMission Rank: SSS-Class.\nThe seven knights were gathered to cut open the impossible fate, and set foot into the unexplored stage of humanity that will slowly become a holy war.",

But as it often happens in video games, something goes wrong: the young and reckless Petka accidentally teleports the ship into the future, namely 1969. The ship collides with Hugh Hefner\u0027s motorboat. Chapaev is unconscious, and Petka realizes that the future once again depends only on him... \n \nLike the previous games in the series, Zoloto Partii (\"The Gold of the Party\") is a puzzle-solving adventure, mainly focusing on inventory-based puzzles. Graphically, it follows the template introduced in the previous game. The title and the setting are an obvious parody on James Bond; but the game also pays homage to Leisure Suit Larry: Love for Sail, also the seventh installment in the famous humorous adventure game series; like Love for Sail, it is set on a ship, and revolves around \"pleasing\" young sexy women.",

The Snipes are armed as well, and will be firing back at you! If you lose all of your lives, the game ends and the Snipes win. There are numerous skill levels available; in the higher levels the snipes are more numerous, more aggressive, and the maze walls become deadly to touch.",
