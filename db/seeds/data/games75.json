Stratosphere focuses on floating island battles which players control.\n\nGameplay consist of the player controlling a single floating island which are called flying fortresses in the game. These fortresses float because they are built from \u0027floatstones\u0027 which can be collected from mountainsides and also from other fortresses after damaging them. There are three types of floatstones each used to build different structures on the fortress. Extra land can be added to the fortress but at a limit of its fortress size class.\n\nThrough the build view, fortresses can build structures that increases maneuverability such as thrusters for moving forwards and backwards, and side thrusters to rotate the fortress. The amount of these maneuverability structures determine the power. They can also build gun turrets and defensive structures such as walls and shields as well as energy generating structures and also some unique structures. Each requiring different amount of resources from three different types of floatstones.\n\nAll flying fortresses float at one altitude. Turrets are controlled with the mouse and can be fired at wanted direction after clicking on position that is in its firing range. Some turrets can also shoot at ground level, which is used during missions in the campaign to destroy turrets placed on the ground.",

Team Deathmatch allows you to test your speed and skill against other players while the Horde mode lets you stand alongside your friends against waves of enemies.\n\nWhen it\u0027s time to lay down your bow, why not pick up a cricket bat and revolver?

An extra mode that is practically an additional game, Zoccer delivers a multiplayer first person sports shooter experience you\u0027ve never seen before.",

There are also sets of level specific songs such as the metal-remix of the Metal Gear Solid theme and a Castlevania theme after unlocking the Vampire Hunter. Levels are unlocked by beating a certain amount of objectives in a current level, such as collecting items like boots and other objects, performing tricks in certain areas of a level, and the occasional grinding a certain amount of meters. The Evolution Skateboarding engine was used in the bonus skateboarding mode included in the PlayStation 2 version of Metal Gear Solid 2: Substance.",

Beside changing the battle system, the game\u0027s perspective switches to a side-scrolling view, as opposed to the top-down one of the previous games. Adol also has the ability to jump now. New to the series is the use of magical rings, which give Adol different powering-up abilities such as healing and shielding. The game also uses various key items found along the way to solve minor puzzles and progress the story.",

The gameplay, the graphics, units, buildings, even single animations are extremely close to the original. \n \nThe game is a real-time strategy game where the player controls one of three races (Hominides, Inteliom, Kreators) and tries to destroy all the others on the map. To accomplish this task, he can build a base with many different buildings such as weapon factories, barracks, power plants and so on. He also has to gather resources to build all his stuff, in this game, he needs to get Quark and some liquid crystal. \n \nThe game features three different campaigns (one for each race) as well as skirmish mode, network and online play (the latter using a server).",

The player will need to Design chassis, engines, transmissions, and vehicles.\n\nManage production lines, supplies, prices, and employees. Build factories and distribution branches. Set marketing and racing budgets, and most importantly stay profitable. All while hundreds of AI marques attempt to do the same thing.\n\nArmed with a realistic economic simulator with historical purchasing power parity per capita, population, and economic data for over 250 cities, GearCity aims to be a hardcore realistic business simulator. This is not a typical casual tycoon game. Instead GearCity is a modern descendant of the classic 90s management games Detroit and MotorCity. Despite the fidelity of the simulation, once you get the hang of the game it is fairly simple and easy to play. You can choose a more abstract style, or dive deep and micromanage every detail.",

Inhale enough enemies and you can launch one huge Blaster Bullet capable of wiping out a troop of Waddle Dees. Now\u0027s your chance to battle iconic bosses like Kracko Jr. and King Dedede in 3D!\n\nInhaling multiple enemies to launch Blaster Bullets is a great way to pump up your score and go for a bronze, silver, or gold star. Another way to score big is to rack up a combo by continuously firing at enemies without missing. Or you could always just collect coins as you jump across platforms. As you progress, you\u0027ll unlock EX stages, which provide a tougher challenge to master. Celebrate your victories by tapping a Kirby series amiibo figure to build a statue in the plaza that plays new music!",

    "summary": "ToeJam \u0026 Earl is an early 1990s dungeon crawler. The game features two alien rappers, who have crash-landed on Earth and parodies 1980s urban culture. The game\u0027s design was heavily influenced by the role-playing video game Rogue, and took from it such features as the random generation of levels and items. Played from a 2D-top-down perspective the game contains both single-player and two-player cooperative modes. The latter displays a single screen when both characters are near each other, but splits it apart when they are not. Playing the game with two players reveals dialogue and jokes between the characters not heard in the single player game.",

Starting out underwater, reach the top of the pond while avoiding dangerous alligators and fish (you can ride a turtle for safety!). Once on top of the pond, hop across logs, birds, and even a whale to the life preserver trailing behind a tugboat. In the third location you have to hop across a flock of birds to reach a cloud at the top of the screen. Each frog has a time limit to safely reach one of the homes on each of the three screens. You move on to the next level when a frog has safely reached each of the homes on all screens.",

    "summary": "Technōs created once again a vastly different experience with Double Dragon II on the NES. The experience system was dropped, but the moveset still underwent a few changes. The elbow attack and turning jump kick are gone, but with the standard kick directed backwards they seemed a bit redundant anyway. There are two new ways to make enemies in a grapple suffer, elbow smashes to the head, and a high kick to propel them away. In the brief time window when the Lee brothers are crouching after a jump or after getting knocked down, it’s possible to perform a rising uppercut or a knee jump attack. The timing for these isn’t easy, but they are the most powerful moves in the game.\n\nOn the NES, Double Dragon II is a much more innovative and unique sequel than in the arcade, but it marks also the time Double Dragon started its schizophrenic shifting between wildly different tones and gameplay styles. In a way it’s one of the best games to bear the Double Dragon name, but it’s hard to shake the feeling that Technōs had already started to loose a cohesive vision of what it meant to be Double Dragon, both in tone and in gameplay.\n\nThe PC Engine CD version by Naxat Soft is surprisingly modeled closely after the NES game, from featuring mostly the same levels down to the rule of having no more than two enemies on screen at a time. But it does mix and match different types together, and in general extends the stages with additional hoodlums. There are a few other notable structural differences – namely, the fight on the huge moving bulldozer at the end of the forest level is missing, but to make up for its omission, the Lee brothers actually have to fight Willy before they meet their own shadows like in the arcade game. They also get to face the Shadow Master (now without the cape) on any difficulty level, although you miss out on the second round in a church and the good ending with Marion revived unless you beat the game on the Hard difficulty mode."

Pressing the attack button of the player\u0027s current direction will do a standard series of punches, while pressing the opposite attack button will perform a back kick. A few new moves are added as well, including a Hurricane Kick.\n\nLike in the original game, the arcade version of Double Dragon II is divided into four missions: a heliport, a lumber storehouse, a wheat field, and the new hideout of the boss. Each stage has its own boss character with his own theme. After defeating Willy (the final boss from the original game) in the fourth stage, the player will confront a double of their own character for the game\u0027s final battle. If two players reach the end together, then both will each to have to face their own clone for the final battle.",

However, this country was in the midst of war and dangerous no matter where you went.\n\nMeanwhile, the main character Alice, a realist who and by no means a dreamer, was saved from drowning in a lake, and by then had lost all of her memories.\n\nShe was unable to remember the people she never met, the people she used to be friends with, nor the circumstances surrounding them.\n\nPeople she is supposed to be meeting for the first time, who seem somehow familiar and important, and someone she has forgotten…\n\nIn a country full of unfamiliar times, Alice builds new relationships despite her discomfort, learning to accept her lost memories and insane life.\n\nWill this realist protagonist be able to find an honest romance in an unconventional world?",

In each level there is a checkered flag, to which Babe must take a herd. The sheep aren\u0027t very good at finding their own paths, so Babe has to walk them through every step of the way. Clear obstacles, set up roadblocks to make detours, and generally do what you have to in order to make a safe route for the sheep. Watch out for obstructions such as carts in the airport and rushing rivers on the farm. Detailed still-screens of all of Babe\u0027s friends appear between the levels to move the story along. A password save system is included if you need to take a break from the brain-bending action. Can Babe save the day once again?",

Techniques range from basic punches and kicks, to more elaborate manoeuvres like hair grabbing moves and elbow strikes. When playing with another player, one can assist the other by grabbing their partner\u0027s opponent from behind. Caution should be taken, though, as some enemies are able to do the same thing to the players. The player begins the game with a certain number of extra lives and a life gauge which depletes as the player takes hits. If the life gauge runs out or the time limit reaches zero, the player will lose a life.\n\nThere is a small variety of enemy characters that the player will face through the course of the game. Certain enemies carry melee weapons, which can be knocked out of their hands and picked up to use against them. Available weapons include baseball bats, whips, throwing knives, and dynamite; in addition, rocks, oil drums, and boxes can be found in certain places.\n\nThe game is divided into four different stages or \"missions,\" which consist of a city slum, a factory, the woods, and the gang\u0027s hideout. The game normally ends if a single player defeats the final boss alone. However, if two players manage to complete the game together, they are then forced to fight each other in order to determine who will win Marian\u0027s affections.",

And then to decide it should graphically look like something involing alien pond snakes and cellular life? Makes no sense, right? We at PomPom pride ourselves in making as little sense as possible. Hence our decision to do all the above. The result is JellyPops.\n\nIt goes something like this: You control a strange snake creature, which resides in a strange pond in a strange world with some strange rules. The aim is to stay alive as long as possible. Staying alive drains your live force, so Snake needs to collect life force gems to keep it going. With time, life gems become more and more scarce, resulting in a desperate race to reach the next gem before its lights out.\n\nBetween Snake and the life force gems are a myriad of other beasties that require special attention. Coloured Jellies which boost your gems value when collected as part of a combo. Teethy fish things that try to blast you with plasma. Spikey rocks and walls. Bouncing spherical cells that can be controlled and used as battering rams. Each level with its own unique mechanics to understand and master.\n\nFeatures :\nAvailable on PSP minis\nEndless survival gameplay\n8 ponds to traverse\nFun, slippy slidey racing type gameplay\nBonus Spirit and Boost unlockables\nMedals awarded for achievements\nCustom music which dynamically chages with gameplay\nQuick playtime. The perfect game for filling 5 minutes.",

It retains the plot and cutscenes, but the platforming action and environmental puzzles have been reworked into a side-scrolling format, though with some 3D elements. There are also occasional motorcycle levels. For the most part, the upper screen shows the action and the lower screen has inventory, which is manipulated with the stylus. However, when you approach enemies, the lower screen switches to a first-person view and you must quickly shoot your foes by tapping them with the stylus. As in the other versions, gameplay revolves around finding a number of artifacts in exotic locales. In this case, you must blow on the DS microphone to dust them off. While Lara moves in two dimensions for the most parts, the graphics are 3D, and the environments are often viewed from angles other than the straight-on that is standard for the genre.",

The player\u0027s party will travel overland on a flat terrain made up of vectors, on which 2D objects are zoomed (The same type of engine was later used in Eternam). The player will encounter monsters and fight them in real-time combat, and discover the palaces of the dragon lords. Indoors, the player has to find a way through the maze of chambers, solving puzzles and defeating the minions of the Drakkhen. Party members are depicted in four status windows on the left side of the screen, thus allowing to see their current status and equipment at once.",
