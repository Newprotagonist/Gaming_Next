    "summary": "Neverwinter Nights: Hordes of the Underdark is the second expansion for the role-playing game Neverwinter Nights. BioWare has created a dark and dangerous world of adventure set in the world of Dungeons \u0026 Dragons. Your hands are callused from many years of weapon play, your mind is sharp from hundreds of books studied, your feet are nimble from slipping unseen and unheard past thousands of guards and your faith is unshakable in the gods you worship... but will it be enough for this final terror? Will you stand once more for those who cannot? You are the last hope for the Forgotten Realms, you must face the unstoppable, you must decide the fate of all. You are a hero... but are you a legend? Epic levels, new prestige classes, new creatures, spells, feats, weapons and new tilesets to explore... endless adventure!\n\nNeverwinter Nights: Hordes of the Underdark will include a new 20-hour single player campaign, designed for high-level characters and set amidst the famous city of Waterdeep and the foreboding Underdark from the D\u0026Dr game\u0027s Forgotten Realms campaign setting. Hordes of the Underdark will significantly expand upon the Neverwinter Nights universe, most notably with the addition of Epic Level gameplay. Based upon the rules published by Wizards of the Coast in the D\u0026D game supplement Epic Level HandbookTM, Epic Levels will be available for characters who have reached level 20, allowing them to advance as far as level 40.\n\nIn addition, Neverwinter Nights: Hordes of the Underdark will introduce several new prestige classes, including the Shifter, a druidic class specializing in shape shifting; dozens of new feats, such as Epic Reputation, Craft Weapon and Armor Skin; a multitude of new weapons and spells, many designed solely for epic level characters; challenging new creatures pulled straight out of the Underdark, including Mind Flayers, Beholders and Driders; several new character voice sets for even greater character customization; and 17 new epic soundtracks from composer Jeremy Soule.",

Points scored for killing monsters and picking up gold count towards experience, and the character gains levels at regular intervals. With each level, the character\u0027s health bar increases, other attributes such as range improve, and the character also becomes invulnerable for a few seconds. Along the way, different weapon and armor upgrades for each character may also be picked up.\n\nKing of Dragons features a simple control system that consists of a single attack button, and a jump button. By pressing both buttons, the character unleashes a magical attack that strikes all enemies in screen (its strength varies according to the character used) at the expense of losing energy. The fighter, cleric and dwarf can also use their shield to block certain attacks by tilting the joystick back right before the impact.\n\nThis is one of the many Capcom games to feature the yashichi power-up item. There are three such power-ups hidden throughout the game, each giving the player an extra continue.",

Godzilla VS is the exact same game as the PlayStation 4 Godzilla. \n \n\"Godzilla, the King of the Monsters, first appeared in 1954. Scientists studied Godzilla and found that they could harness energy from the monster. Called “G-Energy,” this seemingly endless source of power was used to better the lives of all mankind. 60 years later, just when mankind’s memory of the beast faded, Godzilla appeared again. Godzilla destroyed at will, all in search of more G-Energy. Such irony, the same G-Energy which was used to better the people’s lives, also caused Godzilla to awaken. Can the G-Force, mankind’s last hope, stop Godzilla? What fate awaits Godzilla once he has consumed all of the G-Energy, and grown to his full potential? \n \nBash your way through over 20 stages of mayhem. Explore Mission Mode, Diorama Mode, and King of Monsters Mode! Collect G-Energy in each stage to Power-Up your Godzilla up to 100 Meters tall!

A blood stained world...\n\nHumans have ignored the existence of this other world because their destinies have never been bound to it...\n\nBut that is about to change since the king and creator of the other world has been murdered. His strength and will had disappeared as the time passed, turning him into and old and defenseless being.\n\nHowever, that didn\u0027t change the fact that within him the incredible power that allowed him to create that other world still existed. Because of that he was attacked by an entity called Final: A powerful creature that emerged from the infinite chaos that exists in the space between both worlds. In a single attack he ripped the king\u0027s heart and ran away with it to the depths of chaos.\n\nIt is said that the one that succeeds at freeing the power within the heart will be given an extraordinary strength; a power that could end all that exists if it falls into the wrong hands.",

    "summary": "Street Fighter, designed by Takashi Nishiyama and Hiroshi Matsumoto, made its debut in the arcades in 1987. In this game, the player takes control of martial artist Ryu, who competes in a worldwide martial arts tournament, spanning five countries and ten opponents. A second player can join in at any time and take control of Ryu\u0027s rival, Ken.\n\nThe player can perform three types of punch and kick attacks, each varying in speed and strength, and three special attacks: the Hadouken, Shoryuken, and Tatsumaki Senpuukyaku. These are performed by executing special button combinations with the controls.\n\nA port for the PC Engine/TurboGrafx CD console was released under the title Fighting Street in 1988. This same version was later re-released for the Wii\u0027s Virtual Console in 2009.",

Oh, and Dropsy can also talk to animals.\n\nDropsy is a non-traditional take on the classic point and click adventure formula starring the game’s perpetually carefree namesake clown as he explores a richly detailed world full of colorful characters and sinister secrets, doling out hugs along the way. Rather than lead players on a singular narrative path, players are free to choose which avenues of adventure they want to explore in an open world setting and can piece the puzzles and story together however they choose.",

Though the shotgun is Max\u0027s weapon of choice, ammo is scarce, and so melee options are the smarter way to go. The \u0027thunderstick\u0027 is an explosive weapon that can be lanced into an enemy\u0027s chest, crackling like a lit dynamite fuse before blowing the victim to smithereens. The Harpoon is also one of Max\u0027s favorite weapon though it can only be used in-vehicle with Chum riding along. Max\u0027s Magnum Opus can be combined with a speedy V12 engine and powerful ramming ability to destroy enemies\u0027s vehicles and weaponry. When simultaneously driving and aiming, the game enters slow-motion and allows you to toggle between targets. Not much is known about the vehicular combat and its features. \n \nMad Max will feature crafting system which can be used to craft new weapons and tools. Max\u0027s garage can also be used to change and modify the car\u0027s engines, chassis, wheels, body works including paint treatment and the “shell” of the auto-mobile and the car’s weight and attributes update accordingly. Max can also be upgraded though it\u0027s plans hasn\u0027t fully been implemented. \n \nMany choices are given in the game, such as, either playing silently or aggressively. Max can also get guidance from Chum about how he can complete his objectives strategically. However, its largely up to the player how he can complete the objectives.",

To begin, you\u0027ll have to bring a group of chickens through the farmyard, carefully avoiding or deactivating any obstacle that may alert the farmers. Then it\u0027s off to the pie machine, where mechanical mayhem awaits you if you aren\u0027t careful. Once you\u0027ve brought the chickens through the pie machine, you\u0027ll be back in the farmyard with a new bunch of chickens and all new challenges ahead of you. You\u0027ll have to avoid obstacles such as dogs, cameras, spotlights, and others, as you make a break for freedom. You can push objects, shut off power, or find shortcuts to get around the many obstacles. And don\u0027t forget to keep an eye out for objects you can use to your advantage. You can also use a password to continue your chicken-saving quest another time.",

Can you perform a ‘slap wheelie’ or a ‘flip’ to earn maximum points in freestyle? Will you be able to knock-out a blistering time in drag? If not maybe you’ll need to upgrade your truck so that it can be faster and go harder, but watch out if you go too hard your truck may break and cost you money to repair!

    "summary": "Unlike Technos\u0027 subsequent game Double Dragon, the playing field is limited to one two-screen-wide area (a subway platform, a harbor, an alley, a parking lot and the hideout of a gang) and does not scroll continuously. Out of the four stages in the game, the first, second and third each begin with the player fighting a group made up of two different types of small fry enemies: one with fewer hit points and a stronger attack (usually armed with a weapon) and one with more hit points, but with a weaker attack and the ability to grab the player from behind, making him vulnerable to other enemies\u0027 attacks.\n\nWhen only three underlings remain (in any combination of the two) their boss will come in from the sidelines and join the fight. When the boss is defeated, any remaining enemies retreat off the bottom of the screen, and the stage ends. The second stage follows this same formula, but begins with a series of enemies riding motorcycles trying to run the player down, and brings in the normal enemies once the bikers have been defeated. The third stage is a gang of women; their boss is a very large woman who cannot easily be knocked to the ground. The fourth stage features a single type of knife-wielding enemy who can kill the player with one hit. Once the player has defeated this first wave of enemies, the main character proceeds to enter a building at the far right of the stage. There, he faces three more knife-wielding enemies and the final boss, a mobster whose gunfire is also deadly with one hit. Once the final boss is defeated, the main character exits the building and is greeted by his rescued girlfriend, who proceeds to give him a kiss. The game then begins the next cycle with an increased difficulty.\n\nIn addition to an eight-direction joystick, there are three buttons; left attack, right attack, and jump. Pressing the attack in the direction the character is facing will punch, while attacking in the opposite direction will perform a rear kick. Jumping, followed immediately by one of the attack buttons, which will perform a jumping kick in the direction of the attack.\n\nPressing the joystick twice quickly either left or right will cause the player to run, at which point attacking in the direction of the run will perform a running punch, jumping will automatically perform a flying kick, and attacking in the opposite direction will bring the player to a sudden halt and perform a back-kick. Pressing down over a downed enemy will make the player sit on top of the enemy, at which point attacking toward the enemy will cause the player to pummel him. The bosses can only be sat on if all normal enemies have been defeated, and unless the boss\u0027 energy level is low enough, he\u0027ll throw the player off.",

    "summary": "Two World II is a fantasy role playing game which continues the storyline from the first game. \n \nAziraal was the ancient god of war revered by the Orcs and said to possess immense powers. When Aziraal\u0027s tomb was opened at the end of the first game, the god\u0027s powers transferred to our hero\u0027s sister. Now the dark lord Gandohar, determined to have Aziraal\u0027s power for himself, has taken our hero and his sister captive and is draining those powers from her. The escape from the prison acts as a tutorial for the game until the hero finally steps out into Antaloor. \n \nThere is a huge world to be explored containing deserts, forests, swamps, seashores, cities and rural areas, plus many hidden caves and dungeons. There will be encounters with every kind of monster imaginable from killer insects to huge beasts, as well as humanoid enemies of varied races. Since the levels of the enemies are not tied to the player\u0027s level, some fights need to be avoided until the hero advances and increases his abilities. The game boasts that there are enough quests to keep players busy for about 100 hours. \n \nIn the single-player game, the hero can be a male only. His specialty (warrior, ranger, mage) can be changed at will by swapping equipment. Success as each is entirely dependent upon how earned skill points are assigned. \n \nTwo Worlds II features improvements over the first game including new user interface, game engine and magic \u0026 crafting systems. It includes all of the gameplay elements that were part of Two Worlds I (riding on horseback, crafting, forging, alchemy). Sailing (planned for the first game, but never released) is possible in this game, albeit in only a few locations. \n \nFeats and skills can be learned to enhance each form of combat. Learned spells can be combined with each other using the new card modifiers to enhance or change their effects. Improvements to the crafting/forging aspects make it possible to improve weapons and armor differently. For instance, objects in inventory can be broken down to their base elements (cloth, wood, iron). \n \nTwo Worlds II also offers five multiplayer modes for up to 8 players: Crystal Capture, PvP, Dual, Adventure (7 chapters), and a Village mode. In multiplayer, new characters are created with a choice of several races and can be male or female.",

The game has very obvious similarities in design and gameplay to R-Type. It is actually believed that some ex-Irem employees left the company to join Aicom, which used to be a subcontractor for various coin-op manufacturers like Jaleco or SNK.\n\nDespite the familiarities, Pulstar is not without innovations. There is the option of using the weapon power bar, which consists of two halves. The right-hand side of the bar turns blue when the fire button is depressed. When fully charged the ship delivers a devastating emission of energy. The left-hand side turns red when it is continually pressed, shooting out a barrage of smaller, rapid blasts.\n\nThe in-game visuals are mostly pre-rendered 3D graphics, which gives the interactive elements a far more realistic appearance. Great care was taken to really place the player into the world of the game, with cinematic style cut scenes and pre-rendered movies.\n\nThere is a hefty reliance on strategy and not just blasting everything in sight. Using the charged weapon is key, and requires careful precision. Also, once a power up is obtained, a small orb appears at the posterior end of the ship. This can be used as an advantage by deflecting/absorbing oncoming enemy fire and taking out small enemies that run into it.",

Players move a space ship left and right to fire at a group of alien ships near the top of the screen. They fire bullets and come swooping down like a kamikaze. Based on the colour they have different behaviour and some of them require multiple hits. To finish the stage all aliens have to be defeated. The wave is repeated in every stage, but enemies gradually become faster. Just like in the regular Galaga, the largest enemies can move down and fire a fixed beam that makes the area smaller to move. After a number of stages a Challenge Stage can be accessed with a new pattern. The player receives a bonus there based on the number of kills. You start with three lives. A bonus ship is awarded at 20,000 points and then at every 70,000 points.",

In Kiribana\u0027s bedroom there is a minigame on her bookshelf called Little RPG.\n\nMost of the time, it doesn\u0027t really matter which character the player controls, since the dream worlds are the same for both characters and effects are even shared in both of their inventories once collected. However there are a few situations where one character can do one thing where the other refuses or is unable to do the same thing.\n\nAlong with collecting effects, there are 3 additional menu types to be found hidden throughout the dream world.",

A video game demo was made available before its release for the Wii\u0027s Nintendo Channel.\n\nAir Traffic Chaos involves the player taking control of an airport control tower for a period. During this period the player needs to achieve a certain score based on orders given to planes and safe take offs and landings. The game has a total of 15 challenges.[1]\n\nThe airports in Air Traffic Chaos are all 5 international and domestic Japanese airports. They are:\n\nFukuoka Airport\nKansai International Airport\nChubu Centrair International Airport\nTokyo International Airport\nNew Chitose Airport\n[1] These each have 3 stages ranging from easy, medium and expert difficulty. Each stage increases in difficulty and brings with it a longer shift with more aircraft to safely land and depart.\n\nThere is no multiplayer gaming but the player can share his/her results and badges records with up to 7 other players through the ATC Library.",

But the way is littered with sinister traps and difficult obstacles. To master these challenges you need to have keen eyes and a good sense for your environment, or your next step may be your last. \n\nBut Teku has a special gift: his left hand is a candle. Let it be a bright beacon to drive off your enemies or to shed light on dark places. \nGorgeous hand-painted watercolor visuals give Candle that special flair, as all backgrounds and characters have been carefully drawn and then scanned, picture after picture. The game consistently feels like a living painting.",

Adventure focuses on a completely new enemy - the sinister race of rat-like humanoids that serve even more formidable creatures seeking to destroy the world of Antaloor. The player\u0027s task is to gather allies, both among old acquaintances and new characters, and contain the danger. The Call of the Tenebrae story campaign provides several hours of fun. It takes place in new, diverse locations, where items and skills are previously unavailable, and more enemies to defeat. Apart from the extensive single-player content, the extension does not introduce any news to the multiplayer mode.",

    "summary": "The first game in the series came out in 1992 on Amiga, Atari ST and DOS. It takes place on the island of Kendoria. At the beginning, the player controls a warrior called Aramir, and he must defeat Krogh, an evil sorcerer who has killed lord Jarel. The game takes its name from Krogh\u0027s fortress, Ishar, whose name means \"unknown\" in the game\u0027s fictional elf language. In order to achieve this, the player\u0027s characters must travel across the whole island and, among other things, meet with the surviving companions of Jarel.\n\nMost of Ishar takes place in an outdoor environment, which was original for computer roleplaying games of the time. It also featured a unique system to change the lineup of player characters: the player can have up to five characters at the same time, but each one will like or dislike his comrades. These preferences come into play when the player tries to recruit or dismiss a character, because the other characters will then vote for or against the recruitment or dismissal. If a character cannot be dismissed by a vote, it is possible for the player to have him assassinated by another character, but there is a risk that other characters will murder the murderer himself, possibly creating a chain of murders that slays the whole party but one.",

It is the official sequel to the wildly popular and immensely successful personal impact simulator - Stair Dismount.\n\nThe highlights of this experience are multiple vehicles, an awesome replay system, level editing features, high-speed physics and an indiscriminate sense of style.\n\nThe purpose of the game is simple - damage awards points. It is up to you to try different combinations of obstacles, vehicles, poses and levels to make it to the top of the leaderboards. To support friendly rivalry, Turbo Dismount supports placing a photo of your friend on the face of Mr. Dismount - such a delightful way to express one\u0027s emotions!",

Each \"movie\" is comprised of five large maps, and can be played by one to four human players, with an emphasis on team-based strategy and objectives.\n\nNew technology dubbed \"the AI Director\" is used to generate a unique gameplay experience every time you play. The Director tailors the frequency and ferocity of the zombie attacks to your performance, putting you in the middle of a fast-paced, but not overwhelming, Hollywood horror movie.\n\nAddictive single player, co-op, and multiplayer action gameplay from the makers of Counter-Strike and Half-Life Versus Mode lets you compete four-on-four with friends, playing as a human trying to get rescued, or as a zombie boss monster that will stop at nothing to destroy them.",

    "summary": "\"This game will creep up your spine and get to your mind! Symptoms such as anxiety, increased heart rate and shivering will occur. This game is not for the sensitive type, but for those who are willing to explore the facets of fear!       \n       \nTHE LEGEND       \nThe Wendigo is a savage predator that craves human flesh and prefers to eats its victims alive. It\u0027s cursed to roam the tribal grounds of North America and is part of the traditional belief system of a number of Algonquin-speaking peoples. Although we don\u0027t know where it came from and descriptions can vary, one thing is certain: it is evil, cannibalistic, has an unending hunger and won\u0027t be satisfied after killing and consuming one victim.       \n       \nThis creature is intelligent, agile, possesses supernatural strength, has enhanced senses and excels in stealth. The combination of these abilities allows it to stalk its victims without being noticed and once it has you in sight it\u0027s probably already too late.       \n       \nCONTROLS       \nFor the best experience we advise to play Seeking Evil while standing. In the case that you prefer to play it while seated it’s strongly recommended to use a non-vr controller or the good old keyboard and mouse set-up.         \n       \nControls for keyboard and non-vr controllers are really straight-forward, but how will Seeking Evil: The Wendigo be played in VR? Let’s have a look:       \n       \nTo ensure a more immersive experience Seeking Evil doesn\u0027t rely on a point teleportation system for locomotion and the trackpad (Vive) or the analog stick (Oculus) of the left controller are used.       \n       \nIn order to sprint you can press the trackpad (Vive) or the analog stick (Oculus) of the left controller. There will also be situations where you’re chased by the Wendigo, here shaking the vr controllers as if you were running will allow you to increase your speed even more which might be a matter of life or death.       \n       \nSince using stealth is important to succeed in burning all the totems; sometimes ducking will be advised to hide from the Wendigo.        \n       \nFinally there are also a couple handheld items which can be easily picked up by aiming your hand towards an item which will then snap to your hand. Once an item is picked up it can be mounted on your belt for later use.       \n       \nGAMEPLAY       \nYou\u0027ll find yourself stranded in the creepy forests of North America. Things might seem peaceful, but don\u0027t be fooled as these grounds are cursed. To break the curse you\u0027ll need to find and burn nine totems. That\u0027s only the beginning since these haunted forests are home to a legendary creature called The Wendigo. This bloodthirsty predator is fast, smart, has great senses and will do everything it can to eat you alive.        \n       \nYou\u0027ll have to combine stealth with tactical timing to outsmart the Wendigo. Oh, and when it attacks, don\u0027t be a hero ... just RUN!\"",
