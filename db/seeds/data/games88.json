As in the first chapter of his journey, the small cell will have to come back to life a part of the organic tissue in which it floats, but this time the method used is very different. You must create and close the beneficial bubbles to attain a level of coverage required to overcome the various levels. These bubbles, once created, will crystallize and explode on contact with the main cell. With increasing levels appear new bonuses and new enemies. There are three worlds, in which appear random barriers and large breathing cells that will hinder the journey of the protagonist.\n\nThe aim of the game is to revitalize the organic tissue (at any level) with the \" beneficial bubbles \" that are drawn from the main character ( \"back to life ... \"). To close the drawing of the bubble must return to the starting point of the \" design \" ( indicated by the yellow arrows ) . In the design phase of the bubble, if the red contours are touched by an enemy or by the protagonist himself, then the construction of the bubble explodes and is canceled. To pass each level you have to fill ( revitalizing ) with the \" beneficial bubbles \" a certain percentage of organic material present in the playfield ( the percentage covered / required is displayed in the lower-right corner of the screen) . There are 300 levels divided into three worlds. With increasing levels appear new enemies and new bonuses. Each level has a time limit to be exceeded, visible in the upper-left corner of the screen. The final goal of the game is to overcome all 300 levels of the three worlds, to complete the mission of the small beneficial cell.\n\nOnce created, the beneficial bubble 'crystallises' after a few seconds (and turns blue). If the main character touches a bubble crystallized, it explodes decreasing the percentage covered. This was done also to improve the 'strategic' side of the game. At the top right of the screen is also a MAP that helps you to orientate in the exploration of the level.","tags":[268435487,268435488,536873632,536873633],"videos":[{"id":9625,"video_id":"ogNqasohKXE"}]},{"id":142252,"cover":{"id":124208,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co2nu8.jpg"},"name":"Castle Grimholt","platforms":[{"id":6,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}],"screenshots":[{"id":416949,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc8xpx.jpg"},{"id":416950,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc8xpy.jpg"},{"id":416951,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc8xpz.jpg"},{"id":416952,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc8xq0.jpg"},{"id":416953,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc8xq1.jpg"},{"id":416954,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc8xq2.jpg"}],"summary":"Explore a forsaken castle filled with secrets and defeat powerful enemies in this dark fantasy boss rush game.","tags":[1,17,268435487,268435488,536871449,536873892],"videos":[{"id":44277,"video_id":"i1dy6_xghKk"}]},{"id":165723,"cover":{"id":174956,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co3qzw.jpg"},"name":"Ragtag Racing","platforms":[{"id":6,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}],"screenshots":[{"id":597665,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scct5t.jpg"},{"id":597668,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scct5w.jpg"},{"id":597674,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scct62.jpg"},{"id":597679,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scct67.jpg"},{"id":597682,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scct6a.jpg"},{"id":597685,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scct6d.jpg"},{"id":597687,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scct6f.jpg"},{"id":597689,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scct6h.jpg"},{"id":597690,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scct6i.jpg"},{"id":597691,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scct6j.jpg"},{"id":597692,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scct6k.jpg"},{"id":597693,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scct6l.jpg"},{"id":597694,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scct6m.jpg"},{"id":597695,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scct6n.jpg"},{"id":597696,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scct6o.jpg"},{"id":597697,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scct6p.jpg"},{"id":597698,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scct6q.jpg"},{"id":597699,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scct6r.jpg"},{"id":597700,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scct6s.jpg"},{"id":597701,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scct6t.jpg"},{"id":597702,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scct6u.jpg"},{"id":597703,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scct6v.jpg"},{"id":597704,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scct6w.jpg"},{"id":597705,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scct6x.jpg"},{"id":597706,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scct6y.jpg"},{"id":597707,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scct6z.jpg"},{"id":597708,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scct70.jpg"},{"id":597709,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scct71.jpg"},{"id":597710,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scct72.jpg"},{"id":597711,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scct73.jpg"}],"summary":"Start your engines and join the mayhem in Ragtag Racing.

Further atmospheric detail is provided throughout the game in the form of background music and sound effects, as well as an animated image of the player character on the righthand side of the screen.

Out here, using forgotten technologies, she hopes to bring back a life that shouldn’t have been lost.\n\nIn ECHO everything has consequence: As you try to wield its magical technologies it becomes apparent that the Palace has a will of its own… It studies everything you do, everything you are – to use it against you.\n\nThe Palace creates Echoes – exact copies of you in every way. They behave like you and only do the things you do. So the way you play the game shapes your enemy. If you run, soon the Echoes will get faster. If you sneak, they will get stealthier. If you shoot, they will start to shoot back. The game constantly reacts to your every choice and input.\n\nThe Palace \"reboots\" every few minutes, resulting in a blackout. This blackout-cycle is the rhythm at which the \"Echoes\" get updated with your latest behavior, learning and unlearning from your actions. During the blackout the palace is blind, giving you the freedom to act without consequence. This is the time to run and gun and do all the things you don’t want the Echoes to learn.\n\nThe experience is one of being up against your own choices from the last blackout-cycle, giving you a way of shaping the game from cycle to cycle. It is up to you whether you prefer to keep a low profile or if you choose to go head on and deal with the consequences later – one thing is certain you need to keep your wits about you as you face the ultimate enemy: Yourself.","tags":[1,18,268435461,268435468,268435487,268435488,536871029,536871882,536871939,536875043,536875046,536875057,536875794,536875800],"videos":[{"id":8345,"video_id":"yTwn0mGiulk"},{"id":9652,"video_id":"2zsPgoMvf8Y"},{"id":15140,"video_id":"GdswtlTQauk"},{"id":16274,"video_id":"ybXBxD9LWiM"},{"id":16280,"video_id":"brm-qH5U4yY"}]},{"id":125845,"cover":{"id":171346,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co3o7m.jpg"},"name":"OCO","platforms":[{"id":6,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"},{"id":14,"name":"Mac"},{"id":34,"name":"Android"},{"id":39,"name":"iOS"}],"screenshots":[{"id":595385,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sccreh.jpg"},{"id":595386,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sccrei.jpg"},{"id":595387,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sccrej.jpg"},{"id":595388,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sccrek.jpg"},{"id":595389,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sccrel.jpg"}],"summary":"OCO is a minimalist puzzle-platformer - featuring procedurally-generated music, a built-in editor, online community, and over 75,000 levels.","tags":[1,268435463,268435464,268435465,268435488,536872341,536872892,536873706,536873971,536875049,536888338,536896743],"videos":[{"id":53776,"video_id":"42fklxIwUZc"}]},{"id":16654,"cover":{"id":102810,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co27bu.jpg"},"name":"TorqueL","platforms":[{"id":6,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"},{"id":46,"name":"PlayStation Vita"},{"id":48,"name":"PlayStation 4"},{"id":130,"name":"Nintendo Switch"}],"screenshots":[{"id":100025,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/uy7eqnhxqw7jkcedhlgi.jpg"},{"id":100026,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/utuig0n6lsbz670jcegd.jpg"},{"id":100027,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/x1th30zbioxxlem8orbv.jpg"},{"id":100028,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/wjbiutvufnhqrb37zjqa.jpg"},{"id":100029,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/o0jfozjsqjj2jz2r6gsn.jpg"}],"summary":"TorqueL is a unique 2D \"rolling\" & \"extend\" platformer/action/puzzle game.\nIncluding total 50 chambers, 7 basic routes, and 1 secret route.","tags":[1,268435488,536871529,536875439,536888348,536888499,536890219],"videos":[{"id":29079,"video_id":"xGNkjxCewYI"},{"id":29080,"video_id":"a4x3S8YUv3A"},{"id":29081,"video_id":"4A2sTnUCYjs"}]},{"id":96113,"name":"Twin Soul","platforms":[{"id":6,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}],"screenshots":[{"id":209050,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sqjffcpx2xsbftkllbhs.jpg"},{"id":209052,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/gsluh8k2lr4cuaasnucn.jpg"},{"id":209053,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/jny0tsvk4dzhwuayqz7g.jpg"},{"id":209054,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/w101qnwcupce8u6nlwch.jpg"},{"id":209056,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/aifrinb0dlkr3gg32yee.jpg"},{"id":209057,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/ozfwopvtyzjhs8vnusuh.jpg"}],"summary":"Twin Soul is a co-op puzzle horror video game that takes place in an distant and desolate town somewhere in Eastern Europe.

However, this sequel manages to improve on its predecessors almost in every area by featuring a more fluid and friendly gameplay, an expert in-match commentary or the customization support to edit the teams’ default settings. It also has FMV clips. \n \nFirst you’ll get a lot of choices in the main menu. You can decide you if you want to play a Friendly match (for a short game), Practice (the best way for rookies to learn how to play), and competitions (where you get different options, like Championship, league, Knockout and world cup). \n \nIn the main menu you also have the options to edit teams! Yes you can edit your country name, and can put in your favorite names for the players on your team, an option that very few games offered at that time. You can also change the colors of your team’s uniforms, and choose the best tactic (to play in a 4-2-2 or 3-5-2 formation and such). You can even change the face of your players. Fantastic, isn’t it?! And another great option of this game is that all players have their unique statistics. But the possibilities don’t end here. You even get to choose between an indoor and a traditional outdoor tournament. The indoor tournaments (as you may know) are actually a whole different game of soccer. The ball can never be out of the field, your players run faster, and there are many more differences that make separate this game from the traditional game. \n \nYou can play with comments, like the British style that you can see on TV, and with or without music. You can define the time for every match (it can be between 2 and 10 minutes) and you can play either with the keyboard, or with a joystick. \n \nThe graphics are good for the time of game’s release, at the same style is similar to Vr Soccer, they use a 3D environment, that gives you more realistic movements of the players, which gives a more realistic feel while playing soccer. This game also has an option for two players, playing in the same team or one against the other. The music is good, but after a while it can get too repetitive, but since this is a soccer game you can turn the music off.","tags":[268435470,536870938,536870939]},{"id":133190,"cover":{"id":217549,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co4nv1.jpg"},"name":"Kill Your Friends","platforms":[{"id":3,"name":"Linux"},{"id":6,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"},{"id":14,"name":"Mac"}],"screenshots":[{"id":777319,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scgns7.jpg"},{"id":777320,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scgns8.jpg"},{"id":777321,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scgns9.jpg"},{"id":777322,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scgnsa.jpg"},{"id":777323,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scgnsb.jpg"},{"id":777324,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scgnsc.jpg"}],"summary":"Kill Your Friends is a multiplayer online arena shooter for up to 6 players.

The protagonist carries a device known as a Reactor, which can be used to discover hidden objects or paths. Some paths require the player to be riding a monster to traverse. Players will be able to ride on the 500 different monsters that populate the game world. The monsters come in either land, sea, or sky varieties, meaning that different types monsters are required to traverse different paths. Players can also equip them with accessories and level them up. \n \nLeveling up a monster can give it new abilities, such as the ability to do more jumps in a row and therefore access areas previously out of reach. The Reactor device can also be used to scan monsters to discover information about them. If the player attacks a monster while riding, the other monster begins the battle stunned or knocked out. A competitive mini-game is included called \"Great Riders Cup\" that uses the monster riding system of the main game and allows up to four players to compete either with the game AI or with local players or others over Wifi. The games protagonist can be visually customized with different color for hair, scarf, boots, pants, and gloves. Monsters can also be color customized by finding and rescuing a monster called Color Fondue who can perform \"Color Fusion\" on monsters a player controls. \n \nAs with the previous game, Square Enix released Joker 3 Professional, an expanded version of the game, on February 9, 2017. Professional is the final entry in the Joker series.","tags":[17,18,268435468,268435487,536870990,536871105,536871208,536871882,536871938,536872256,536873302,536873311,536875045],"videos":[{"id":9960,"video_id":"KhRuhmFPCgw"},{"id":9961,"video_id":"925D87DHuho"},{"id":9962,"video_id":"cBFXn_rlnBQ"}]},{"id":55176,"aggregated_rating":60.0,"cover":{"id":29632,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/wlv17kayenryn8ekcsuc.jpg"},"name":"Shantae: Half-Genie Hero - Pirate Queen's Quest","platforms":[{"id":6,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"},{"id":41,"name":"Wii U"},{"id":46,"name":"PlayStation Vita"},{"id":48,"name":"PlayStation 4"},{"id":49,"name":"Xbox One"},{"id":130,"name":"Nintendo Switch"}],"screenshots":[{"id":119033,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/arxolqsdcmz5g1bbwwwy.jpg"}],"summary":"\"Raise anchor and set sail for a total re-imagining of the base game’s play style, theme, and storyline.

Luxor the Moonprince's son Morkin has been kidnapped by Shareth, daughter of Doomdark, the evil ruler deposed in the first game. The player initially takes control of Luxor, Rothron the Wise, and Morkin's lover Tarithel the Fey, although many more characters can be recruited as the game progresses, as they aim to banish Shareth and rescue Morkin. Shareth has brainwashed him, so he must also be turned back to Luxor's side. \n \nThe game is effectively turn-based; your characters move by day (with a limited amount of movement possible, with each move in one of the 8 compass directions) and Shareth's by night. You will find plains, mountains, forests, underground tunnels and mysterious temples on your journey. A dark mist follows much of the area, which causes your characters to deteriorate in mood and thus become less effective. \n \nThe characters are now split into five distinct tribes - Giant, Dwarf, Fey, Icemark and Barbarians, and recruiting new characters into your party isn't automatic - factors such as the game situation can make some refuse to join, turn on members of other races, or defect (as the Utarg did in the first game). \n \nThere are several different objectives and possible outcomes to the game. Bringing Morkin back to the Gates of Varenorn is the most basic one, but many other characters ought to be saved, Shareth can be killed completely (with practice!), and there are many Crowns of Icemark to be retrieved. As in the first game, control of the full party only remains while Luxor is alive - his death means total defeat.","tags":[17,268435468,268435471,268435480]},{"id":93645,"cover":{"id":87915,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co1vu3.jpg"},"name":"Blood II: The Chosen + Expansion","platforms":[{"id":6,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}],"screenshots":[{"id":221322,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/ygpkts1ogylspj7kayje.jpg"},{"id":221323,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/q7e6xlz8xqp83tnr9cdh.jpg"},{"id":221324,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/qfefckuvgv7mgvatb1le.jpg"},{"id":221325,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/noo1opdhjaw4hdfkrqbm.jpg"},{"id":221326,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/lfzvtsdpi0nfmyq7kmtz.jpg"}],"summary":"Includes original Blood II: The Chosen and add-on package The Nightmare LevelsAn immersive atmosphere full of dark humor and exciting actionFour playable characters and wide variety of weapons","tags":[1,268435487]},{"id":37071,"cover":{"id":74725,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co1lnp.jpg"},"name":"Driving Essentials","platforms":[{"id":48,"name":"PlayStation 4"},{"id":49,"name":"Xbox One"}],"screenshots":[{"id":306974,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc6kv2.jpg"}],"summary":"Driving Essentials, the premier driver training program, is now available on Xbox.

It belongs to the fantasy genre and was the first fantasy game published by Infocom after the Zork trilogy (it was originally intended to be Zork IV). The game had a parser that understood over 700 words, making it the most advanced interactive fiction game of its time. It was Infocom's ninth game.\n\nKrill, an incredibly powerful evil warlock, is spreading chaos and destruction. None of the more experienced members of the Circle of Enchanters dare to attempt to stop him. In desperation, the player, a novice Enchanter with only a few weak spells in his spell book, is sent in hopes that Krill will either fail to detect him or dismiss him as harmless. More powerful spells can be found on scrolls hidden in various locations, but as the player becomes more of a threat, Krill will respond accordingly.\n\nThis game features an innovative new spell system based partially on Ursula K. Le Guin's Earthsea series and partially Dungeons and Dragons' Vancian spell system, where spells must be prepared through \"memorization\" before being cast. As in the Earthsea series, each spell is represented by some nonsense \"magic word\" which is treated as a verb by the game's text parser, so that one can use the FROTZ spell (which causes objects to glow and give off light) by typing >FROTZ BOOK, in exactly the same way as one might type >PICK UP BOOK or >READ BOOK.","tags":[17,268435487,536871130,536871348]},{"id":135587,"cover":{"id":109130,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co2c7e.jpg"},"name":"Fluxteria","platforms":[{"id":48,"name":"PlayStation 4"},{"id":130,"name":"Nintendo Switch"}],"screenshots":[{"id":391352,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc8dyw.jpg"},{"id":391353,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc8dyx.jpg"},{"id":391354,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc8dyy.jpg"},{"id":391355,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc8dyz.jpg"},{"id":391356,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc8dz0.jpg"}],"summary":"Welcome to Fluxteria, non-stop arcade-space-shooting action in full 3D. \nFour modes of play: Story Mode, Survival Mode, Timed-Attack Mode and Obstacle Race Mode.","tags":[1,268435461,268435489,536871886]},{"id":117312,"aggregated_rating":76.25,"cover":{"id":85515,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co1tzf.jpg"},"name":"Embr","platforms":[{"id":6,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"},{"id":48,"name":"PlayStation 4"},{"id":49,"name":"Xbox One"},{"id":130,"name":"Nintendo Switch"},{"id":170,"name":"Google Stadia"}],"screenshots":[{"id":304717,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc6j4d.jpg"},{"id":304718,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc6j4e.jpg"},{"id":304719,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc6j4f.jpg"},{"id":304720,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc6j4g.jpg"},{"id":304721,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc6j4h.jpg"},{"id":304722,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc6j4i.jpg"}],"summary":"Embr is a frantic fire-fighting (un)Simulator set in a hyper-capitalist, deregulated alt-present where public firefighting funding has run dry, and venture capitalism and e-hailing rule the roost.
