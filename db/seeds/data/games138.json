As the fighters receive punishment, these portraits show injuries such as cuts and bruises, the severity of which indicate the fighter's health (or lack of). There is also a boxing glove shaped meter at the top of the screen, that indicates how much power a boxer has left in his punches (as in a real fight, the more punches boxers throw, the more tired they become, resulting in weaker punches).\n\nThe fighters movement about the ring is limited to side-stepping left or right; it is impossible to step back or forward. A variety of punches can be thrown; left jabs, crosses to the head, hooks to the body, and uppercuts to the head (all punches except jabs can be thrown with either hand). It is also possible to throw a limited number of so-called 'super punches', that are essentially either a right cross or a right uppercut, but with extra power. At the start of each round, each boxer is capable of throwing one super-punch at any time, although it becomes possible to throw one more with each knockdown they score against their opponent. Defensive techniques consist of blocking, dodging, and clinching. Each boxer has three attributes: 'power', 'stamina', and 'chin'.","tags":[1,268435460,268435470,536871544,536875225,536875359,536875360,536876210,536876437],"videos":[{"id":40764,"video_id":"eNFCKmTKPdo"},{"id":40765,"video_id":"rFBJR9pdMpA"}]},{"id":7799,"cover":{"id":8178,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/tunibtpkpqxkogiko4sh.jpg"},"name":"Boxxle","platforms":[{"id":33,"name":"Game Boy"}],"summary":"The player must maneuver boxes in a warehouse in order to make enough money to woo his desired girlfriend.","tags":[268435465,268435471,536871878,536872617,536874694,536874943]},{"id":48961,"cover":{"id":70571,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co1igb.jpg"},"name":"Boxxle II","platforms":[{"id":33,"name":"Game Boy"}],"screenshots":[{"id":269940,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc5sac.jpg"}],"summary":"Boxxle 2 is a puzzle game in which you have to push crates from point A to point B without getting them stuck.\n\nThe player must maneuver boxes in a warehouse in order to make enough money to woo his desired girlfriend.","tags":[268435465,268435471],"videos":[{"id":24025,"video_id":"-f-VEOYa3us"}]},{"id":182402,"cover":{"id":198787,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co49dv.jpg"},"name":"Invasion Versus","platforms":[{"id":6,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}],"screenshots":[{"id":690103,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sceshj.jpg"}],"summary":"Invasion Versus is a fast-paced asymmetric action game that pits two players against each other.

They are based on the movie of the same name. Three different games were produced, each produced on two systems.\n\nThe version for the Commodore 64 and NES was a simple left-to-right scrolling platformer, in which RoboCop was required to collect/destroy at least two-thirds of the drug \"nuke\" in each level and arrest two-thirds of the suspects by running into them (in contrast to shooting them). If RoboCop does not manage to attain the required amounts of nuke or number of arrests then he has two chances in the game to prove his efficiency at a shooting range. If he succeeds, he may continue onto the next level. If he fails, or if both chances at the shooting range are already used up, he must repeat the level.\n\nThe version for the ZX Spectrum and Amstrad CPC was also a platform game, but one that offered movement in both directions (vertically and horizontally) as well as into various areas providing an element of exploration. There were also a number of puzzle sub-games that had to be completed to progress in the game.\n\nThe version for the 16-bit Commodore Amiga and Atari ST was similar in nature to the 8-bit Spectrum and Amstrad CPC versions, but contained completely different levels to take advantage of the extra power offered by these computers.\n\nThere was also an arcade-only version of RoboCop 2, developed and published in 1991 by Data East (who still held the rights to create arcade games based on the franchise), which allowed up to two players at once (one controlling the original RoboCop, the other controlling a slightly purple-hued clone). The game followed the basic premise of the movie, but had some major sequential differences.","tags":[1,21,268435461,268435464,268435489,536870979,536871133,536871213,536871487,536872285,536873991,536875054,536875294,536875358,536875942,536876120,536876176,536876694,536877623,536882033,536882646,536885318],"videos":[{"id":2469,"video_id":"JxO3_qE-KFQ"}]},{"id":31445,"name":"Defense of Castle Chilly","platforms":[{"id":6,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}],"screenshots":[{"id":48152,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/r72i7cdayoit2bk4nugk.jpg"},{"id":48153,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/evs8hor6skwifqkmr99p.jpg"},{"id":48154,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/ez6bqdom7o3t63osuwym.jpg"},{"id":48155,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/lsl8ytouavbujiqq0qyk.jpg"},{"id":48156,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/rmjolrrneoljhdejyitl.jpg"}],"summary":"Kill them with arrows, blast them with magic, defeat their armies and protect Castle Chilly!

Papers. Border. is an optimistic strategy game about travelling, freedom and changing the world!  \n  \nYou are a freelance adventurer who wants to experience everything planet Heart has to offer, regardless of the inherited privileges determined by the country of your birth.  \n  \nCONCEPT  \nYou travel to learn, and as you pay a closer attention to what each country has to offer, you gather wisdom that you channel in a blog that grows in popularity. Eventually you come to grasp the power of your influence: where you pass, things change faster to the better, and locals that you have met increasingly demand openness from their governments. You have always been an optimist and dreamed of a completely border free world, but as you travel, you realise you might actually actually live to see your dream come true - that of living in a world without borders!  \n  \nVISUALS  \nHeart. Papers. Border. is inspired by NASA's Visions of the Future posters, The Jetsons' cartoon series and current real life events. We chose vibrant colours and a retro futuristic style to gently remind you that Heart, just like Earth, is moving towards openness, kindness and love, even though the movement might sometimes seem too slow to notice. But you can always make a difference!  \n  \nGAMEPLAY  \nHeart. Papers. Border. is as easy or as challenging as you want it to be. Through very simple control mechanics and up front information, you can strategize an optimal life that allows you to see the last border disappear in the course of your long and safe life. With multiple win conditions, challenging puzzles and morally difficult quests, Heart. Papers. Border. simply asks you how do you choose to live this virtual life  \n  \nSo how will you play?  \n- Create your Multipass and choose your Citizenship (Easy, Med, High, Random); this determines your starting conditions  \n- Take a look at your native country, look at the Top Bar to see your situation and starting conditions  \n- Click on touristic objectives to visit them, click on countries to apply for Visas and then visit them  \n- Gather hashtags from visiting objectives and write blog posts in your SpacePad  \n- Gain followers, become influential, and notice how planet Heart responds to your actions  \n  \nA few Development Details  \nThis is a Pre Alpha game, and we have many features in the pipeline which are Work in Progress now.

Destroying the diamond will clear all monsters of the diamond's color.","tags":[268435464,268435465,268435471,536870990,536871049,536871208,536871878,536872307,536872308,536872961,536873064,536873323,536873787,536873991,536874694,536874943,536875046,536875081,536875130,536875201,536875262,536875434,536875435,536875789,536875870,536875941,536876083,536876266,536876764,536877052,536877088,536877280,536877293,536877626,536877710,536877713,536880980,536883263,536883784,536900541,536902740],"videos":[{"id":35475,"video_id":"rpi_9T-tvv8"},{"id":35476,"video_id":"awDMgm_hcWo"}]},{"id":32979,"cover":{"id":94988,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co21ak.jpg"},"name":"IWO: Bloodbath in the Bonins","platforms":[{"id":6,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"},{"id":14,"name":"Mac"},{"id":39,"name":"iOS"}],"screenshots":[{"id":56827,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/gxosabu7se7mfovtitw5.jpg"},{"id":56828,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/m3cfbxy137cnkalxjxft.jpg"},{"id":56829,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/mz44iknqag1d6an4i9ub.jpg"},{"id":56830,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/lqnmrodevbnaq4bcqw5r.jpg"},{"id":56831,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/xypki6wkd157eu1va4ss.jpg"}],"summary":"Iwo Jima was a critical point on the flight path of US bombers from their Saipan bases to their Japanese targets.

Cadash borrows many principles of Zelda II: The Adventure of Link's gameplay, combining side-scrolling platform action with an RPG system of statistics, levels, money and magic.\n\nFour characters can play at once in the arcade version, and up to two players may select from four different characters in the console versions: fighter, mage, priestess, and ninja, each with different attacks, statistics and skills. Players then proceed through each level, killing monsters and bosses, collecting keys to unlock doors and collecting gold and experience. Gold is also taken from slain foes and treasure chests. Villages sell items, weapons, armor and (in the console versions) extra lives, with each village encountered providing better equipment. Some villagers and benevolent creatures will also provide information. The arcade version has a limited game time, which can be extended by buying progressively more expensive hourglasses at shops, or by picking up rare bonuses. In shops, and in hidden places, are medicinal herbs which restore 10 HP if brought to zero, and antidotes which cure poison inflicted by specific foes. There are also two elixirs in the game that act like medicinal herbs, except that they restore all HP.\n\nThere are five stages in the game.

The game seemed like a major turning point in the series. Rather than focusing on realistic battles, the game introduces four comical characters who are out on a crusade to kill as many Nazis as possible during World War II with whatever weapons they can get their hands on.\nIn August 2012, it was announced that the game would no longer bear the Brothers in Arms name and become its own IP. Randy Pitchford has gone on record to say that he never wanted this game to be a Brothers in Arms game but got pushed by Ubisoft to attach it to a recognizable brand. They agreed to let the public decide by showing it at E3 2011 and the reactions clearly indicated that press and fans did not feel Furious 4 should be a Brothers in Arms title. Furious 4 was then to be re-revealed at Gearbox Software's Community Day on September 25, 2012.\nIn 2015, Randy Pitchford said in an interview that Furious 4 \"is not a thing anymore,\" and that elements of it has been turned into what is now Battleborn.","tags":[268435461,536870931]},{"id":49751,"cover":{"id":87090,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co1v76.jpg"},"name":"Naruto RPG: Uketsugareshi Hi no Ishi","platforms":[{"id":24,"name":"Game Boy Advance"}],"summary":"Naruto: Path of the Ninja is an RPG based on the anime Naruto.

The characters' quest in Curse of the Azure Bonds is to search the Realms for the source of the bonds and rid themselves of the bonds' terrible curse.","tags":[17,22,268435468,268435472,268435487,536870984,536871063,536871138,536871139,536871208,536871237,536871254,536871259,536871260,536871504,536871648,536871938,536872425,536872647,536872835,536872978,536873364,536873473,536874134,536875075,536875160,536875196,536875243,536875306,536875356,536875361,536875380,536875455,536875571,536875735,536875738,536875793,536875803,536875868,536875891,536876301,536876900,536877236,536877554,536877829,536878358,536878375,536878529,536879130,536879783,536880562,536884867,536885418,536886005,536886163,536886164],"videos":[{"id":17242,"video_id":"0twOVl49Vg0"},{"id":30960,"video_id":"_txXQdhVn-E"}]},{"id":21240,"aggregated_rating":80.0,"cover":{"id":22938,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/uef6wj0ujvtpi4mmy86s.jpg"},"name":"Bubble Bobble Plus!","platforms":[{"id":5,"name":"Wii"}],"screenshots":[{"id":28658,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/whb824euezqyik9fpjsn.jpg"},{"id":153981,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sgt2a9wv0yssyxowywgo.jpg"},{"id":153982,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/tb7y4nnl2fck6hpo1p5s.jpg"},{"id":153983,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/vzcm1ty86pmjdx65l7ts.jpg"},{"id":153984,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/geoqlgexsb8w7ymvhfxc.jpg"},{"id":153985,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/diqdptn9g3yfbqioitco.jpg"},{"id":153986,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/hpnkcfhjzbdniynmkgws.jpg"}],"summary":"Bubble Bobble Plus! is a remake of the original Bubble Bobble released for WiiWare.","tags":[268435464,268435465,536871672,536871851,536872225,536872961,536873064,536873249,536873590,536875046,536875489,536875676,536875781,536876375,536876496,536876513,536876971,536877305,536883813]},{"id":198502,"cover":{"id":219004,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co4ozg.jpg"},"name":"Super Mario Flash 2: SMW Remake","platforms":[{"id":19,"name":"Super Nintendo Entertainment System (SNES)"}],"screenshots":[{"id":780872,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scgqiw.jpg"},{"id":780873,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scgqix.jpg"},{"id":780874,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scgqiy.jpg"},{"id":780875,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scgqiz.jpg"},{"id":780876,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scgqj0.jpg"}],"summary":"This is an SMW Hack remake of Super Mario Flash 2, a Flash game based on Super Mario World, developed by Pouetpu in 2011."},{"id":194520,"cover":{"id":213355,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co4kmj.jpg"},"name":"LittleBigPlanet: Metal Gear Solid Level Kit","platforms":[{"id":9,"name":"PlayStation 3"}],"summary":"Create your own homage to Metal Gear Solid with this action-packed Level Kit.

The adventurers must find the path that leads to the Stone Prophet, but the cursed mummy of the ancient pharaoh Anhktepot is watching every step they make...\n\nRavenloft: Stone Prophet is a sequel to Ravenloft: Strahd's Possession. It utilizes the same graphical engine and gameplay system. Like its predecessor, character creation and combat follow the Advanced Dungeons & Dragons role-playing rules; exploration and combat are viewed from first-person perspective, and the battles occur in real time.

The game became a Greatest Hits title in 2003.[1] The game had a follow up titled Scooby Doo: Mystery Mayhem.\n\nThe game puts players in the control of Scooby-Doo in a story that revolves around him searching for the rest of the gang around a haunted mansion after they're kidnapped by an eccentric villain. The game has twelve areas, ranging from graveyards and secret labs to fishing villages and haunted mazes.\n\nThe game received mixed reviews from critics, mainly criticizing the game's simplicity, although its massive environments staying true to the Scooby-Doo! universe was praised by critics and fans alike. Fans of the original show loved the game, feeling it was compensation for the N64 game released in 2000.

The European Community is enjoying a period of relative peace when it is surprised by sudden attacks on German bases from a mysterious force. To investigate, it is decided to send the EC Armor Tactics Research Corps, also known as \"Durandal\". Inside the Durandal, a young new recruit, Elsa soon finds herself caught in an international plot. Meanwhile, the nation of Venezuela, is attempting to secede from the Unified Continental States (U.C.S.). UCS Forces are sent in to restore order and dispose of Governor Diaz. During a routine patrol, Sgt. Darril and his patrol witness a cargo plane being shot down. Heading to investigate, they soon discover it was a plane carrying part of Diaz's gold. For demoralized UCS soldiers like Darril, this smells like opportunity... \n \nFront Mission 4 is a turn based strategy game where the plot switches between two different theaters of operation: Elsa and Darril. Controlling the wanzer forces of either character, the story progresses simultaneously. Most battles take place on an overhead map divided into a Player phase and an Enemy phase. Typically a wanzer can move once and use his remaining Action Points (AP) to fire on the enemy or use an ability. Success in battle earns Experience Points, which are traded in for new abilities, such as Rapid Fire or Evasion bonuses. Each character has a set limit of Skill slots, which are filled up differently by abilities. While each character starts with a preference in skills, there is no limitation on what any pilot can learn. Money, found during on the map (along with items) or earned after a successful battle, can be used to upgrade wanzers and purchase new weapons.","tags":[18,268435468,268435471,268435480,536870933,536871079,536871213,536871487,536871882,536871938,536872019,536872352,536872647,536872651,536872733,536872835,536873066,536873551,536874398,536874694,536874745,536874947,536875160,536875185,536875196,536875197,536875314,536875358,536875380,536875383,536875453,536875455,536875483,536875621,536875868,536875870,536875952,536876262,536876391,536876798,536877279,536877535,536880222,536884022],"videos":[{"id":37387,"video_id":"5pH08Nb8AkA"},{"id":37388,"video_id":"evbpjyIr7MA"}]},{"id":151690,"cover":{"id":217817,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co4o2h.jpg"},"name":"The Mysteries of Ranko Togawa: Murder on the Marine Express","platforms":[{"id":3,"name":"Linux"},{"id":6,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"},{"id":14,"name":"Mac"},{"id":34,"name":"Android"}],"screenshots":[{"id":487386,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scag2i.jpg"},{"id":487387,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scag2j.jpg"},{"id":487388,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scag2k.jpg"},{"id":487389,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scag2l.jpg"}],"summary":"Murder on the Marine Express is a visual novel game and the first installment of The Mysteries of Ranko Togawa series.","tags":[43,268435487,268435490,536871013,536871874,536872617,536888180]},{"id":18656,"cover":{"id":104830,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co28vy.jpg"},"name":"Bunker Punks","platforms":[{"id":6,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}],"screenshots":[{"id":59562,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/q4r3njs2fzkchvci8xh4.jpg"},{"id":59563,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sfy7tbhvubzy2qnbdg2p.jpg"},{"id":59564,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/u038uyfoxsogeyifcspc.jpg"},{"id":59565,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/yw3aalrna1krnbnweogs.jpg"},{"id":59566,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/oiiyfozxsguow55fgcwu.jpg"}],"summary":"Bunker Punks is a roguelike first-person shooter set in a dystopian future.
