Director's Cut was produced to compensate for the highly publicized delay of the sequel, Resident Evil 2, and was originally bundled with a playable pre-release demo of that game. The Japanese version of the demo disc also included a pre-release demo of Rockman Neo, later retitled Rockman DASH (Mega Man Legends outside Japan), and a trailer for the newly released Breath of Fire III.\n\nThe main addition to Director's Cut is an \"arranged\" version of the game that changes the location of nearly every vital item in the mansion, as well as the enemy placement. The main characters, as well as Rebecca, are given a new wardrobe and the player's handgun is replaced by an improved model where any shot fired has a random chance of decapitating a zombie, killing it instantly. The original version of the game is included as well, along with a new \"beginner\" mode where the enemies are easier to kill and the amount of ammunition that can be found by the player is doubled. Additionally, the auto-aim function was restored in all modes, though it is not noted in the in-game controls.\n\nThe North American and European releases of the Director's Cut were marketed as featuring the original, uncensored footage from the Japanese releases. However, the full motion video (FMV) sequences were still censored, and Capcom claimed the omission was the result of a localization mistake made by the developers. The game's localization was handled by Capcom Japan instead of Capcom USA, and when submitted to Sony Computer Entertainment America (SCEA), it was rejected because of one line of copyright text. Rather than remove the individual line, Capcom Japan decided to save time and simply swap in the cinematics from the U.S. release of the original Resident Evil. SCEA then approved the game and manufactured a full production run without Capcom USA having any idea that the uncensored scenes had been cut. Three days after the game's release, the uncensored intro was offered as a free download from their website. The French and German PAL versions of Director's Cut do feature the uncensored intro FMV in color, though they lacked the uncensored Kenneth death scene. Although the PC version of Resident Evil was not billed as the director's cut version of the game, it is the only version of Resident Evil that has all of the uncensored FMVs, which includes the uncensored introduction, Kenneth's death scene in its entirety, and ending as well.","tags":[1,19,268435487,536871809,536872748,536888422,536899440,536900683,536902076,536902082],"videos":[{"id":46548,"video_id":"B1p9VYx-o_U"}]},{"id":33876,"cover":{"id":173105,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co3pkh.jpg"},"name":"Mystery of Unicorn Castle: The Beastmaster","platforms":[{"id":6,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}],"screenshots":[{"id":62270,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/fhyby3uqtu3v8qz6apig.jpg"},{"id":62271,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/duvlltu5np4hzxljjxtw.jpg"},{"id":62272,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/crq973nmdpn7osjtquj8.jpg"},{"id":62273,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/oiah4ah6fervbikkl5xo.jpg"},{"id":62274,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/ph9p2nvugqbczz1rrwox.jpg"}],"summary":"Make your way past the ingenious traps of the Castle and overcome the beasts to restore the Unicorn for a victory over the forces of evil!

But instead, there is an ASMR soundtrack, a stylish minimalistic design and a relaxing atmosphere inside!\n\nAbstractism was delisted on Steam on July 30th, 2018 after players like YouTuber SidAlpha began investigating the game’s high CPU and GPU usage. Investigators discovered the game was running cryptocurrency mining software and the developers encouraged players to leave the game running in the background to accrue in-game items.\n\nAt the same time, the developers were engaging in the practice of releasing Steam Marketplace items that very closely mimicked sought after items from other popular titles. By offering these items to unsuspecting players on Steam, they would sell the item and then alter the appearance and description.\n\nIn response, Valve pulled the game from the Steam store on July 30th and banned the developer from the service. At the time they also instituted a system of confirmation messages that players needed to click in order to confirm item trade offers for games that Steam has identified they have never played.","tags":[268435487,268435488]},{"id":13921,"aggregated_rating":90.0,"cover":{"id":201963,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co4bu3.jpg"},"name":"Borderlands 2: Mr. Torgue's Campaign of Carnage","platforms":[{"id":6,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"},{"id":9,"name":"PlayStation 3"},{"id":12,"name":"Xbox 360"}],"screenshots":[{"id":29653,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/wjijsfxofuxdnatd9hdg.jpg"},{"id":283059,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc62er.jpg"},{"id":283060,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc62es.jpg"}],"summary":"Enter “Mr. Torgue’s Campaign of Carnage” and see if you have what it takes to become champion of this brand new storyline in Borderlands 2.

The putt preview has been improved, allowing the player to simulate the ball's path once per individual spot, taking into accounts elements such as power, speed and elevation. On the Xbox 360 and the PS3, shots are not performed using the analog stick, but with the 3-point timed principle for start, power and accuracy. Shot Confidence is a new addition, keeping track of the player's performance on certain courses, for specific puts and using certain clubs. Great performances raise the confidence, which translates into experience and better performance on specific courses. Low confidence leads to lower accuracy, a pumping heartbeat, and rumbling controls on the Wii.\n\nOn the Wii, players can shake the controls to taunt the opponents with 4 different moves, to throw them off. It can be used to influence air conditions, spin, or adds audio distractions. The controls are available in 3 modes: Full Swing (wii remote), Sitting Swing (new, waggle the wii remote) or the classic controls using the nunchuck for analog play. In Full Swing, twisting the wii remote adds hooks and slices prior to shots. Also exclusive to the Wii is a Miniputt mode.","tags":[268435469,268435470,536870942,536871049,536871186,536872060,536872078,536872205,536875046,536875138,536875139,536875140,536875184,536875271,536875350,536875626,536875627,536875735,536875781,536875824,536876556,536876802,536876999,536877674,536878111,536879774,536879799,536880294,536880839,536880840,536880901,536881408,536882645,536883028,536883352,536883815,536883995]},{"id":12571,"aggregated_rating":87.6363636363636,"cover":{"id":94516,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co20xg.jpg"},"name":"Nioh","platforms":[{"id":48,"name":"PlayStation 4"}],"screenshots":[{"id":18893,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/gwlzl1joc0vlmxz91pmg.jpg"},{"id":18894,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/n4xr9r1atdldc2ydjuvi.jpg"},{"id":18895,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/kdqodedr8zwnweddu63y.jpg"},{"id":18896,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/dj9zs9ldtcfjyuaaiv5c.jpg"},{"id":18897,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/bcjbepvdgpvur966q3j2.jpg"}],"summary":"In Nioh, players will traverse war-torn Japan as William, a blonde-haired swordsman whose background as a fierce warrior and seasoned knowledge of the blade allows him to survive in the demon-plagued land of the samurai.

Almost anything goes during the races including knocking opponents completely off the track with a well-placed kick, fist or weapon. Power-ups and booster items are scattered around the course for increasing performance, speed or providing a new method of attack. Strategy comes into play by knowing which character and which \"pod\" sidekick to choose. \n \nThere are three modes of play: Single Race, Cup and Championship. Each offers unique environments, different obstacles and challenges. \n \nThe Single Player game will put the player up against 5 CPU opponents.

It was first released in Japan, and was later released in North America, Australia, Europe, and other regions. It was originally released in three different versions: Dachshund & Friends, Lab & Friends (Shiba & Friends in Japan), and Chihuahua & Friends. It has been re-released twice since then, first as a bundled release with a special edition Nintendo DS with a new version called Nintendogs: Best Friends, and then later as Nintendogs: Dalmatian & Friends.\n\nNintendogs uses the DS's touchscreen and built-in microphone. The touch screen allows the player to pet a dog, as well as to use various items that can be found or purchased. These range from balls and frisbees, to toys, to grooming supplies to keep the dogs happy. The microphone is used to call to the player's dog by speaking the name given to the dog in the beginning of the game as well as to teach the dog tricks such as \"sit\" or \"roll over\". Players can bring their dogs on walks and to the park if they so choose. They may interact with other players in multi-player by using the DS's wireless linkup. It also uses the DS's internal clock and calendar to allow the dog to grow hungrier or dirtier based on the elapsed time.\n\nNintendogs received critical acclaim. It has an aggregate score of 85% at Game Rankings,[3] and has won many awards, including the 2006 Innovation Award from PC World and Best Handheld Game from the Associated Press. As of March 31, 2015, all versions of Nintendogs combined have sold 23.96 million copies worldwide, making it second on the Nintendo DS best-sellers list, behind only New Super Mario Bros.[4] Because of Nintendogs' success, Nintendo has made several related products, including Nintendogs toys[5] and a series of Nintendogs trading cards.[6] At E3 2010, it was announced a sequel, titled Nintendogs + Cats, would be released for the Nintendo 3DS.","tags":[268435469]},{"id":55009,"cover":{"id":203975,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co4ddz.jpg"},"name":"Nano Diver","platforms":[{"id":38,"name":"PlayStation Portable"}],"summary":"An action JRPG in the same vein as the Monster Hunter series.

The game doesn't have a big persistent world, instead, it is instance based.","tags":[1,17,22,268435468,268435481,268435487,536870938,536870939,536871041,536871063,536871086,536871139,536871208,536871213,536871384,536871492,536871812,536871945,536872070,536872119,536872245,536872489,536872647,536873023,536873066,536873297,536873364,536873473,536874398,536874745,536875046,536875055,536875147,536875184,536875196,536875271,536875311,536875323,536875338,536875356,536875421,536875455,536875523,536875556,536875598,536875695,536875790,536875815,536875889,536875897,536875941,536876105,536876365,536876575,536876690,536876752,536876799,536876879,536876974,536877063,536877077,536877521,536877628,536877686,536877766,536877985,536878350,536880218,536880421,536880422,536880547,536880656,536880863,536883101],"videos":[{"id":5223,"video_id":"83yF8R4wshY"}]},{"id":134808,"cover":{"id":215258,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co4m3e.jpg"},"name":"Hermit the Sluggish Caterpillar of the Sea","platforms":[{"id":6,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"},{"id":14,"name":"Mac"},{"id":82,"name":"Web browser"}],"summary":"Hermit, the lone sluggish caterpillar of the sea, is fighting for his new home with the power of shells.","tags":[268435488,268435489]},{"id":55581,"cover":{"id":43734,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/lbknx1yqdihmnzr2yaje.jpg"},"name":"Pro Gamer Manager 2","platforms":[{"id":3,"name":"Linux"},{"id":6,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"},{"id":14,"name":"Mac"}],"screenshots":[{"id":121903,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/nnl8rqhpuwl8zz39iznv.jpg"},{"id":121904,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/m6w8deogump3vvvm6udb.jpg"},{"id":121905,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/yvodop59tk75riyifaz8.jpg"},{"id":121906,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/xwdtaxyyfhq0esffqu4b.jpg"},{"id":121907,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/cqcerghziks0l4vu4qzo.jpg"}],"summary":"Pro Gamer Manager 2 is an e-sport simulator game.

It's a mod for UT2004, but it has nothing to do with a shooter (a pure sports game).\n\nSo you got these football pitches, and you have to get the ball into the enemy goal. You have a hammer tool. With that one you can kick other players around, kill the enemy ballowner with 2 hits and also kick the ball away (volley).\nIn your own penalty zone you can kill all enemy players with one hit. With the ball launcher you can charge up a shot, the longer you hold it the harder it will be and you can even add spin to the ball, so it will curl in the air.\nJust like in football you should have a keeper in your goal. He has some special abilities like he's 30% faster than others,he can dodge and jump higher.\nDeath Ball should be played with 6-10 players\nThe gameplay is very easy too learn, but it's hard to master. At first it seems to be pretty simple, but the more you play the more you realise how complex it is and how many possibilities your team has. The ways to score are infinite.","videos":[{"id":60214,"video_id":"ifP9vYFV7hE"},{"id":60215,"video_id":"zSm97YUZgSI"}]},{"id":135022,"cover":{"id":215252,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co4m38.jpg"},"name":"Even in Arcadia","platforms":[{"id":3,"name":"Linux"},{"id":6,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"},{"id":14,"name":"Mac"}],"screenshots":[{"id":394671,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc8gj3.jpg"},{"id":394672,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc8gj4.jpg"}],"summary":"An experiential narrative game about people, plants, and interplanetary capitalism.","tags":[18,268435469,268435488]},{"id":6889,"aggregated_rating":60.0,"cover":{"id":133610,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co2v3e.jpg"},"name":"Spirit Camera: The Cursed Memoir","platforms":[{"id":37,"name":"Nintendo 3DS"}],"screenshots":[{"id":27903,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/gvueemb30yg6lof9ti48.jpg"},{"id":173542,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/s1d67ehfn1sqo3m2sjus.jpg"},{"id":173543,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/pzcy9ahctuayycblhsgh.jpg"},{"id":173544,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/kwa8vv9h4fwjsl2f3chj.jpg"},{"id":173545,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/x0ij5pxxzpl7hrf8jjta.jpg"},{"id":173546,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/wruftj9gmp5cyob82yy7.jpg"}],"summary":"Spirit Camera: The Cursed Memoir introduces a mysterious girl named Maya who has been hiding in the shadows of an old house.

The game's plot traces decades of war among six factions (Solar Empire, Western Frontier, Anglo Isles, Iron Legion, Tundran Territories, Xylvania), and unfolds through contemporary missions that advance the conflict and flashback missions that reveal its history.\n\nPlayers control a soldier or a land, sea, or air vehicle to engage in combat directly and to command other units. The Wii Remote is used to target and fire, but selecting and ordering units is performed through conventional button presses. The Wii Nunchuk's thumbstick controls player movement, and evasive maneuvers are handled through gestures.\n\nIn the single-player campaign mode, the player assumes control of the various factions at different points in the conflict's history. The game also features three online multiplayer modes. Skirmish mode is a timed two-player match to score more points than the other player by destroying opposing units. Assault mode is a timed two-player match in which one player attempts to destroy the other player's resources and fortifications while the other defends. Co-Op mode is an untimed two-player match in which both players work together to complete special online missions that are not part of the single-player campaign. Offline local multiplayer is not supported.","tags":[1,39,268435461,268435467,268435469,268435471,536870913,536870933,536870937,536871213,536871475,536872019,536872060,536872074,536872245,536872352,536872594,536872733,536873822,536874182,536874539,536874694,536874743,536875052,536875073,536875158,536875171,536875199,536875271,536875350,536875358,536875437,536875456,536875464,536875484,536875494,536875523,536875610,536875822,536875870,536875904,536875941,536876055,536876106,536876107,536876365,536876476,536876990,536877049,536877407,536877494,536879870,536880725,536880839,536881084,536883573,536883995]},{"id":8476,"cover":{"id":215270,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co4m3q.jpg"},"name":"Hocus Pocus","platforms":[{"id":3,"name":"Linux"},{"id":6,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"},{"id":13,"name":"PC DOS"},{"id":14,"name":"Mac"}],"screenshots":[{"id":86680,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/vymss3qj4skmicsgsrqt.jpg"},{"id":86681,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/q0yzq9bhf6v5zinrzurm.jpg"},{"id":86682,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sdfarzsmr8oswnixrdks.jpg"},{"id":86683,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/iobtoigpwvmhyf7ysttc.jpg"},{"id":86684,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/dtfudju6ioxfyoto5rxm.jpg"}],"summary":"Terexin, leader of the Council of Wizards, is sending the young sorcerer, Hocus, on a special mission to prove his worthiness.","tags":[1,17,268435464,268435486,268435487,536871059,536871075,536871200,536871208,536871298,536871846,536871855,536871971]},{"id":109564,"cover":{"id":215264,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co4m3k.jpg"},"name":"Imperishable Memories","platforms":[{"id":3,"name":"Linux"},{"id":6,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"},{"id":14,"name":"Mac"}],"screenshots":[{"id":409806,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc8s7i.jpg"},{"id":409807,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc8s7j.jpg"},{"id":409808,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc8s7k.jpg"},{"id":409809,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc8s7l.jpg"},{"id":409810,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc8s7m.jpg"},{"id":409811,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc8s7n.jpg"}],"summary":"Imperishable Memories is a narrative-driven shoot-em-up game developed in Unity for PC, Mac, and Linux.

The PC version was developed by Sierra On-Line and is incompatible with anything except an original IBM PC/XT with a CGA video card. \nIn the Atari-ported versions the hero is named Sir Dudley, and the girl, married to Sir Dudley, is Lady Penelope.","tags":[1,268435464,268435487,268435489,536870976,536871049,536871519,536871701,536871758,536871939,536871945,536871971,536872010,536872117,536872448,536872957,536872961,536873064,536873236,536873237,536873300,536874398,536874706,536874745,536875073,536875075,536875101,536875226,536875243,536875281,536875308,536875420,536875491,536875668,536875756,536875852,536875934,536876099,536876205,536876208,536876211,536876473,536876540,536876752,536876852,536878324,536878481,536879154,536879177,536880135,536880227,536880564,536880871,536882965,536883546]},{"id":19194,"aggregated_rating":70.0,"cover":{"id":162632,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co3hhk.jpg"},"name":"MechCommander 2","platforms":[{"id":6,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}],"screenshots":[{"id":27468,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/ujwlhqsarxbk7hd0x1ee.jpg"},{"id":27469,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/c6c6caxqslbkxf78mkvi.jpg"},{"id":27470,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/x6kph2sl8xnb80sdjw5r.jpg"},{"id":27471,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/iomgwaujpbsdawfklkem.jpg"},{"id":27472,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/bp0yvazzqlygkk4dcd8u.jpg"}],"summary":"MechCommander Gold is the 1999 update to FASA Interactive's MechCommander, which contains both the original title's campaign and an entirely new 12-mission scenario called Desperate Measures, which incorporates several new 'Mech, weapons, and vehicles.","tags":[18,39,268435467,268435469,268435471,268435480,536870930,536870937,536870981,536871078,536871079,536871516,536871882,536871906,536871938,536871945,536872060,536872383,536874451,536874539,536874694,536874964,536875185,536875257,536875559,536876028,536876315,536876365,536878081,536879024,536882095,536883113,536883114,536883115,536883116,536883117,536883118,536883119,536883120]},{"id":5821,"aggregated_rating":54.125,"cover":{"id":78864,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co1ouo.jpg"},"name":"Eragon","platforms":[{"id":6,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"},{"id":8,"name":"PlayStation 2"},{"id":11,"name":"Xbox"},{"id":12,"name":"Xbox 360"},{"id":20,"name":"Nintendo DS"},{"id":24,"name":"Game Boy Advance"},{"id":38,"name":"PlayStation Portable"}],"screenshots":[{"id":674476,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scegfg.jpg"},{"id":674477,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scegfh.jpg"},{"id":674479,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scegfj.jpg"},{"id":674481,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scegfl.jpg"},{"id":674483,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scegfn.jpg"},{"id":674484,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scegfo.jpg"},{"id":674486,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scegfq.jpg"},{"id":674487,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scegfr.jpg"},{"id":674488,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scegfs.jpg"},{"id":674489,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scegft.jpg"},{"id":674490,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scegfu.jpg"},{"id":674491,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scegfv.jpg"},{"id":674492,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scegfw.jpg"},{"id":674493,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scegfx.jpg"}],"summary":"Eragon is a third-person video game released for the PC, PlayStation 2, Xbox, and Microsoft Windows, developed by Stormfront Studios.
