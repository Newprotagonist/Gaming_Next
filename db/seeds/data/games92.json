Utilizing the power of the next generation consoles, and building off the critically-acclaimed NHL Collision Physics system, every player on the ice is governed by physics at all times. Feel the hard-hitting chaos of NHL hockey through true-to-life secondary collisions, net scrambles and player pileups, capturing the desperation of every shift. \n \nREAL PUCK PHYSICS \nThe puck is one of the most complex items in the game to authentically replicate and it finally gets its due in NHL 15. Completely rebuilt puck physics result in a more realistic feel to every puck interaction. Everything on the ice, including the ice surface itself, is live which leads to the unpredictable and authentic puck spins, rolls and bounces seen in a real NHL game. \n \nAUTHENTIC PLAYER & EQUIPMENT MODELS \nThe Next Generation Hockey Player has been rebuilt from the ice up. Now player models have three distinct layers - the body, equipment, and jersey. Each layer interacts independently, making every contact with the puck or other players even more realistic. Dynamic Cloth technology adds an extra layer of realism as it reacts to the player’s movement as they explode up the ice, helping bring the speed of the game to life. \n \nUNPRECEDENTED PLAYER LIKENESS \nPowered by the same technology that brought the most realistic representation of the athlete to EA SPORTS UFC, NHL 15 delivers groundbreaking player likeness, emotion and animation. From the strides a player takes to get up the ice to the emotion on their face after scoring a game winning goal, the players are as real as they’ve ever been. \n \nSUPERSTAR SKILL STICK \nNow all the tools of an NHL superstar are in your hands. The revolutionary Skill Stick has evolved to give even more control to the player. Protect the puck, receive passes without breaking stride, and discover an arsenal of sweet new dekes, all with an intuitive right stick control scheme that is easy to use but packed with depth. \n \nAUTHENTIC ARENAS \nThere is no feeling like being there, and we are giving you the best seats in the house. The power of the next-gen consoles finally allows the NHL franchise to capture every detail of an NHL arena. Unique arena elements from 19,000+ seat capacities to lighting and player entrance tunnels are captured with a level of detail not possible on the previous generation. Now those home games will truly feel like home. \n \nNEW COMMENTARY TEAM \nNew voices for a new generation. NHL 15 welcomes the NBC Sports commentary team of Mike 'Doc' Emrick and Eddie Olczyk to the broadcast booth. TSN analyst Ray Ferraro will provide game insights at ice level. Combined with Real Life Broadcast Integration that will feature real-world pre-game video commentary with Doc and Eddie set against in-game visuals, NHL 15 takes a revolutionary step forward in sports videogames; where the lines between the real world of sport broadcast and the game are blurred. \n \nNBC SPORTS GAME DAY PRESENTATION \nThe most realistic broadcast package in a video game to-date is possible because of a new partnership with NBC Sports. Set the scene with the NHL on NBC crew welcoming you to the city during the game intros and immerse yourself in an experience that matches what you see on television with NHL on NBC graphics and branding. \n \nLIVING CROWDS \nNHL 15 sets a new standard in videogames with over 9,000 individual crowd models with 4x the animations of previous generations. Take a look through the glass and you’ll see fans hold up signs with your name on them, costume wearing superfans, or even sections full of team rivals rooting against you. Feel their behavior change after dropping the gloves, landing a big hit, or scoring a clutch goal. The crowd is alive. \n \nVISION AI \nAn elevated level of player intelligence, Vision AI features evolved awareness with players reading and reacting to potential plays. Scoring area recognition, pass anticipation, and enhanced team breakouts all improve the flow of the game.","tags":[32,268435469,268435470,536870956,536872060,536872078,536872219,536877488,536878163,536878167,536878169,536889503,536890153,536890764,536890765,536890766],"videos":[{"id":2843,"video_id":"SPds2-s7DTA"}]},{"id":4855,"aggregated_rating":67.5,"cover":{"id":110614,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co2dcm.jpg"},"name":"Ferrari Challenge: Trofeo Pirelli","platforms":[{"id":5,"name":"Wii"},{"id":8,"name":"PlayStation 2"},{"id":9,"name":"PlayStation 3"},{"id":20,"name":"Nintendo DS"}],"screenshots":[{"id":30887,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/vqnz6bbzmzvdo11igsgg.jpg"}],"summary":"Ferrari Challenge Trofeo Pirelli is a racing game developed by Eutechnyx and published by System 3, based on the Ferrari Challenge, a single-marque motorsport championship.

The easiest difficulty level starts the player(s) in the first level with no bonuses. The player controls a tank with constantly draining fuel, and must navigate through multiple levels (14 stations in the arcade version) from bottom to top, encountering obstacles and enemies. Along the way, a player may find powerups including tank fuel, stars (currency), shields, and two types of sub-weapons: smart shots (homing missiles) and bombs (powerful rockets). Each level has a key that will open a door at the top of the level, which will either take the player to the next level or to a special hub with multiple powerups that must be escaped in 10 seconds or less. If the player is unable to escape, the tank will lose half its fuel. After escaping the hub, the player(s) then proceeds to the next station. \n \nOccasionally, the player(s) will face a boss that must be defeated to advance. Normal shots are ineffective however, and the player must decide/guess the appropriate time to buy sub-weapons to greatly raise the chance of victory. After destroying a boss, the player(s) can continue to the end of the level. \n \nBetween levels, the player is taken to a shop where items and upgrades to tank speed, power, etc. may be purchased with stars. Any damage caused to the player's tank will decrease the shield level. Purchasing a shield drastically reduces damage down to a mere pixel worth of the fuel gauge per hit. When the fuel depletes, the speed of the tank is reduced to a crawl and a countdown begins from 10. If no fuel is gained before the timer reaches zero, or if the player is shot during the countdown, the tank explodes and a life is lost. \n \nThe arcade version, in addition to having special two-joystick controls for each player, contained three special contest levels, with one contest star in each. With three contest stars and nine normal stars, the player(s) could compete in a special time-limited contest level in which the player could win a T-shirt. A later version of the game was released which eliminated the contest levels and stars.","tags":[1,18,268435461,268435489,536870913,536871078,536871475,536871572,536871644,536871882,536872211,536872733,536873186,536873874,536874398,536874743,536874745,536875056,536875076,536875171,536875258,536875262,536875300,536875303,536875356,536875384,536875524,536875539,536875639,536875707,536875879,536875941,536876120,536876123,536876572,536877127,536877277,536878004,536881061,536881939]},{"id":15793,"aggregated_rating":40.0,"cover":{"id":83124,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co1s50.jpg"},"name":"Legend: Hand of God","platforms":[{"id":6,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}],"screenshots":[{"id":45992,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/st1dcaxrsxw89fab159r.jpg"},{"id":45993,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/kmcimkwokzgobdijcdmy.jpg"},{"id":45994,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/fhn6qw53cwipee9hmgfo.jpg"},{"id":45995,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/hoqf8pgugtmox6uvb15j.jpg"},{"id":45996,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/renlprioxovbfojjx9y7.jpg"}],"summary":"Become immersed in the fantastic world of Aris is a world populated by Orcs, Elves, Dwarfs and Humans.

Tolkien’s Middle-earth that has been continuously running, enhanced, and remastered since fall of 1991. In MUME, players are encouraged to role-play as they live in this meticulously crafted world exploring the conflict leading into the War of the Ring during the late Third Age. The action takes place nearly 100 years prior to The Hobbit but long after the loss of the One Ring by Sauron. The key to Erebor has just been found by Gandalf in Dol Guldur and all the epic tales narrated in The Lord of the Rings may take place. \n \nMUME covers 28,000+ original rooms from the mighty Dwarven Halls beyond the Gulf of the Lhûn in the West to the Mountains of Mirkwood in the East, and from the ruins of Fornost Erain in the North to the fortress of Isengard in the South. \n \nPlayers can choose among several different races, each with some unique characteristics. The races are separated into three striving factions. Dwarves, Elves, Half-Elves, Hobbits and Men — among them are the shapeshifting Beornings — are eternally at war with the Orcs, Trolls and Black Númenóreans. Moreover, the orkish tribe of the Zaugurz is trying to expand its territory at the expense of the Tarkhnarb Orcs of Goblin Gate. Most of this conflict takes place to the east and south of the town of Bree, but rare raids or solitary agents of the Red Eye have made it to as far west as the Dwarven homes in the Blue Mountains.","tags":[38,268435468,268435481,536871402,536872758,536874546,536896816,536896817],"videos":[{"id":39545,"video_id":"0qTj5XMCS04"}]},{"id":166497,"cover":{"id":175729,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co3rld.jpg"},"name":"Street Dreams","platforms":[{"id":6,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}],"screenshots":[{"id":602100,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sccwl0.jpg"},{"id":602101,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sccwl1.jpg"},{"id":602102,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sccwl2.jpg"},{"id":602103,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sccwl3.jpg"},{"id":602104,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sccwl4.jpg"}],"summary":"Street Dreams is a fast-paced VR action FPS set in a psychedelic dream world.

It is the mid 1950s and the race for dominance between the US and the Soviet Union is about to move into a new dimension: space. Take charge of the US or Soviet space agencies - your duty is be the first to the moon. Carefully manage your budget by opening programs, spending R&D funds on improving the hardware, recruiting personnel and launching space missions in this realistic turn based strategy game. \n \nRoad to the Moon features the race to the Moon, the historical event that started in the early 1960s and that ended in July 1969, after the successful completion of the Apollo 11 mission. \n \nThe game features both a campaign and a sandbox mode. In campaign mode, you will be able to play as the Director of either NASA or the Soviet Space Agency in order to beat the other side to be the first on the Moon. You can also lead the Global Space Agency (GSA), an fictional space agency that combines programs from all the major space agencies in the world . In the GSA campaign, you will need to address the requests and short-term goals issued by government, and is geared towards those players who prefer a game experience focused on exploration instead of competition. Alternatively, all three space agencies feature a Sandbox mode, which provides a more open-ended experience and allows you to try out different approaches without any political pressure. \n \nYou will be able to develop dozens of programs. Some examples include the X-15 and the PKA space planes, the Sputnik satellite, the Mercury, Voskhod, Apollo and Soyuz manned spacecraft and the Mars Viking probe. You are not limited to missions that did launch, as as the game also allows you to try out many concepts that were planned but that never left the drawing board. For example, instead of sending men to the Moon using the Lunar Orbit Rendezvous (LOR) approach used by Project Apollo in the late 1960s and early 1970s, you will be able to rewrite history and use either the alternative Gemini Earth Orbit Rendezvous (EOR) or Gemini Direct Ascent (DA) schemes. The number of options available ensure every game will be different and there is huge replay value. \n \nTo verify its accuracy and authenticity, the game, is being developed in consultation with Dr. Buzz Aldrin, former U.S. Air Force combat pilot (66 missions in Korea) and NASA astronaut, who took part in the first Moon landing mission and became the second human being to walk on the Moon. \n \nIf you have any interest in space exploration and the events that transpired during the 'Race to the Moon', this is a game you just do not want to miss.","tags":[17,22,268435469,268435471,536871906,536872060,536875067],"videos":[{"id":33691,"video_id":"9dR9HXj4zGE"}]},{"id":43237,"cover":{"id":76720,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co1n74.jpg"},"name":"Street Boyz","platforms":[{"id":8,"name":"PlayStation 2"}],"summary":"Street Boyz is an Action game, developed by Tamsoft and published by D3Publisher, which was released in Japan in 2004.","tags":[1,268435460]},{"id":131862,"cover":{"id":94374,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co20ti.jpg"},"name":"Kirikou and the Wild Beasts","platforms":[{"id":8,"name":"PlayStation 2"}],"summary":"Adapted from the famous movie by Michel Ocelot and Benedict Galup, Kirikou and the Wild Beasts puts you in the shoes of a hero who must face the dangers hanging over his people.

And if you're really good, you might just discover the original Centipede.","tags":[1,18,268435461,268435489,536871078,536871138,536871208,536871851,536871937,536872651,536873024,536873064,536874182,536874688,536875056,536875122,536875147,536875148,536875149,536875150,536875201,536875205,536875262,536875271,536875284,536875610,536875707,536875752,536875789,536875904,536875941,536876028,536876415,536876611,536876713,536876767,536877630,536878194,536879816,536880079],"videos":[{"id":1298,"video_id":"iuD9vJFaWHY"}]},{"id":19571,"name":"Fusion Wars","platforms":[{"id":6,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}],"screenshots":[{"id":25136,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/o3nuvfukly8bru87sobx.jpg"},{"id":25137,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/saze13jkzjsyik4znlew.jpg"},{"id":25138,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/gnfkj0kncxqdmpxtxzit.jpg"}],"summary":"FUSION WARS will take you into the cockpit of a combat ship, transporting you to futuristic arenas where to prove your skills avoiding perils and enemies.

Player Last Spells can only be used immediately after being hit, with a grace period of less than 1 second.\n\nAdditionally, there is a \"Time Orb\" system which affects the story/score, as well as a gauge which tracks how human/youkai (normal/focused) you are and determines how you can collect more time orbs.","tags":[1,17,268435461,536870990,536871029,536871078,536871117,536871138,536871208,536871823,536872225,536873476,536874273,536874274,536874398,536875158,536875941,536876634,536878105,536878192,536879840,536879841,536880987],"videos":[{"id":12110,"video_id":"tLXvt-a6hXE"}]},{"id":81997,"cover":{"id":74484,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co1lh0.jpg"},"name":"Plants vs Zombies: Garden Warfare 2 Deluxe Edition","platforms":[{"id":6,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"},{"id":49,"name":"Xbox One"}],"screenshots":[{"id":587461,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scclad.jpg"},{"id":587464,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scclag.jpg"},{"id":587466,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scclai.jpg"},{"id":587469,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scclal.jpg"},{"id":587472,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scclao.jpg"},{"id":587474,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scclaq.jpg"},{"id":587475,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scclar.jpg"}],"summary":"The battle for Suburbia grows to crazy new heights in Plants vs. Zombies Garden Warfare 2!

Some examples include popularity ratings, political relations, and economic exchanges between countries. Various organizations, including NATO, use the technologies in the Masters of the World simulator for education and training. Over one thousand playable actions.At the country’s helm, the player/head of state can act in many areas: budget, taxation (nearly thirty types of taxes), currency, economy (over 130 economic activities), foreign and domestic affairs, defense, society, labor, health, social security, education, environment, transportation, culture, and more.\n\nFor each of these areas, numerous laws can be proposed and must be voted on by the Parliament in order to pass. For example: setting social welfare benefit minimums, changing the retirement age, developing atomic weapons in secret, subsidizing the auto industry, hiring teachers, defining the powers of unions, setting speed limits on roads, regulating prostitution, creating an international film festival, etc.\n\nThe player can also construct elements on the world map, which will change accordingly: nuclear plants, wind farms, military bases, pipelines, high-speed train lines, airports, and many more.\n\nEvery action has its consequences. Lobbies, social groups, and leading national and international figures will intervene if their artificial intelligence finds it necessary to do so (interviews with the press, resignations, protests, strikes, roadblocks, wars...).\n\nTo prevent tension, the player can meet with any figure, or address the media (over 8 hours of dialog in the game).\n\nThanks to its intelligence services, the player also has an entire arsenal of spies and “special” ops. For example, he or she can - at his or her own risk - reveal scandals about another political party, dismantle terrorist networks, sabotage a foreign infrastructure, have an opponent assassinated, etc.\n\nAs the head of the military, the player can move all of his or her units around the map from their actual bases during military conflicts.\n\nInternational organizations (over 50 organizations included) play an important role. At the UN, for example, the player can denounce a nation in order to obtain the Security Council’s authorization for a military intervention. The player can also create his or her own organization.Lastly, in order to stay in power, he or she must actively campaign to make sure he or she is elected.","tags":[268435469,268435471],"videos":[{"id":4724,"video_id":"2Z_qvgTUCV4"},{"id":4725,"video_id":"PtbNJBpXFMo"}]},{"id":196439,"cover":{"id":216003,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co4mo3.jpg"},"name":"Age of Evil","platforms":[{"id":13,"name":"PC DOS"}],"screenshots":[{"id":769801,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scghzd.jpg"}],"summary":"Age of Evil is a horror comedy themed total conversion for Duke Nukem 3D: Atomic Edition.

Its most defining features were its speed and countering system. Dead or Alive put an emphasis on speed, and relied more on simplistic commands and reaction time. Furthermore, its countering system was the first in the fighting genre to utilize different commands that corresponded to each type of attack.

With a controller, the targeting cursor is controlled in a manner similar to a Third-Person Shooter.
