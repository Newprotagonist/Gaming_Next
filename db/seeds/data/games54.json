You have the aid of power-ups (some with a positive effect and others with a negative effect). As you progress through the levels, you keep on gaining more and more points until finally, when you die you can save your final score into the Hall of Scores (the top twenty scores are shown). The game features a level editor, which has the ability to build any kind of level featuring all the tile sets that are featured in the campaign. The last game feature is the ability to play against other people (up to eight others and on the same computer), in which you play the campaign. Once you die the campaign resets and starts all over again for the second player. At the end (once all players have finished their campaign), it shows all high scores and whoever obtained the highest score wins.",

It runs upon Namco Pac-Land hardware (but with a video system like that used in Dragon Buster, modified to support a 2048-color palette). It uses a Motorola M6809 microprocessor, with a Hitachi HD63701 sub-microprocessor (both running at 1.536 MHz) and Namco 8-channel waveform PSG for audio. \n \nThe player must take control of a man known only as Runner, who is given a time limit to run through each of the game\u0027s thirty-two rounds while avoiding obstacles and collecting drink cans. The actual running happens automatically: the job of the player is to avoid the obstacles and collect the cans by moving the Runner with the stick and adjusting his speed accordingly. \n \nIf the Runner finishes the round within the time limit, the remaining time will be awarded to him as bonus points and he will proceed to the next round. Every fourth round is special, using the remaining time from the three previous ones as additional time. However, if the Runner has not finished the round by the time the time limit runs out, he will be electrocuted and the game will immediately be over.",

It was also included in the Sega Genesis Collection for the PlayStation 2 and PlayStation Portable but it was omitted in PAL version (Sega Mega Drive Collection).\n\nIt is the second game in the Shinobi series released for the Mega Drive, following The Revenge of Shinobi. However, it is not a continuation of the previous game, but rather a loose adaptation to the 1989 arcade game Shadow Dancer. Like in the original arcade game, the player controls a ninja followed by a canine companion. The Secret of Shinobi was well received by critics.",

In 2001, the game was re-released for the Game Boy Advance handheld system with new save features and minor graphical enhancements, with the English version being released in Europe for the first time.\n\nSet in a fantasy world, Breath of Fire follows the journey of a boy named Ryu, one of the last surviving members of an ancient race with the ability to transform into mighty dragons, as he searches the world for his sister. During his quest, Ryu meets other warriors who share his quest, and comes into conflict with the Dark Dragon Clan, a militaristic empire who seeks to take over the world by reviving a mad goddess. The game experienced mostly positive reception upon release, and was followed by a direct sequel, Breath of Fire II, in 1994.",

Unlike most platformers, Milon\u0027s Secret Castle is less about defeating all of the enemies in an area, and more about scouring every bit of each room to find the secrets that lie within Garland Castle! Milo can uncover practically anything in the game. This includes: items, power-ups, money, shields, keys, level exits, even shops! The only way to get to each level boss is to find the right secret items!",

    "summary": "A ball, two goals, and a couple of toasters : Welcome to Toasterball. In this unconventional tournament, the toasters are athletes and the laws of physics are merely a suggestion. \n \nToasterball is a party game (2-4 player), made to be played with friends on a good old couch. Because you play as toasters, you can naturally expect some slapstick physics and funny on-screen situations, but there is also a real learning curve, and enough gameplay variants and minigames to keep on surprising you. \n \nThe basics of Toasterball are quite easy to learn : simply press one of the buttons on your toaster for a short time, release it, and watch your toast fly through the air. The longer the press, the higher your toast will be launched. Each ejection also makes you jump, allowing you to hop around the field and push your opponent into tight situations. From there, any means are allowed to put the ball inside your opponent\u0027s goal! \n \nGo to Toasterball.com to try the early demo : \n \nhttp://toasterball.com/",

Watch out dudes, it\u0027s all over! Dodge a few grommets on the way in to max your score.\n\nOnce you get your feet wet, be prepared to freeze \u0027em off as you take on the challenge of Snowboarding. Take the scenic route as you pilot a chopper to the top of the mountain. Parachute down, but watch your height... That \u0027chute needs time to open, you know! It takes real heavy thrashing to get down in one piece, let alone winning time. On the way down pick up a little bonus time by showing the crowd your stuff in the Snow Bowl.\n\nGet majorly amped with Jet Surfing, just about the hottest thing to hit California since sunshine. Snag one of four surf jets and rocket onto the course. Race around the buoys and go for speed, or try a few ramps on for size. Beat the clock or your friends: there\u0027s no speed limit on these waters, pal!\n\nIf you really want to take off, try Hang Gliding. Search for thermals cruising above the coastline. Once you get the hang of it, you can try a few radical stunts just for the heck of it... But blow the landing, and you\u0027ll be eating a California cliff burger. Pass the salt, dweeb.\n\nOnce you\u0027ve mastered the others, you\u0027re ready for the toughest challenge of all... outlaw Skateboarding down the meanest aqueduct on The Coast. Just when you think you\u0027ve caught the rhythm of the halfpipe, bam!... Everything goes black, and you\u0027re corkscrewing through this killer fullpipe. Survive that and it\u0027s back into the sunshine in front of the crowd. Oh, by the way, did we forget to mention the concrete wall? Yow! Sorry, dude... to air is human.",

    "summary": "Age of Empires: Castle Siege invites you to guide your empire through the Medieval Era on your Windows PC or touch screen device. Choose from one of several civilizations, including the Britons, Teutons, and Kievan Rus. Upgrade your keep, fortify your walls, and garrison defensive troops to protect yourself from marauders. Then, train an army to raid other cities, and command them in battle to dismantle your opponents’ defenses. \n \nAge of Empires: Castle Siege was a free-to-play medieval massively multiplayer online tower defense game in the form of a Windows app, designed for Windows 8.1 and Windows Phone. Released in 2014, the app featured micro-transactions to aid in rapid development of a castle and to improve defensive and attacking capabilities. It was developed by Smoking Gun Interactive and Microsoft Studios, and was formally announced on August 26, 2014. Unlike any preceding Age of Empires game, Castle Siege takes the form of a tower defense game. Castle Siege was made available on iOS in 2015 and Android in 2017. \n \nOn November 13, 2018, Microsoft Studios announced that it would close the game on May 13, 2019, and since then, it is presently not working.",

Players also have the ability to customize the car as desired, by adjusting everything from the tire pressure to the transmission. In addition to the official Indy Racing League tracks, there are road courses to race on as well. Players will have to race their hardest, as the cartridge will save all of their racing data so that they can compare their stats to a friend, or even race one in the Multiplayer mode. INDY RACING 2000 manages to keep the franchise fresh by offering plenty of tracks and options, with great racing fun in the lead.",

    "summary": "Experience the thrills of the Arena Football League with KURT WARNER\u0027S ARENA FOOTBALL UNLEASHED. The rules of Arena Football differ from the NFL in number of ways. Most notably, the field is only 50-yards long and balls played off the large nets to the sides of the goalposts are live. All of your favorite teams from the AFL are included, so pick your team and get ready for some fast football action. Once you choose a team, you can take on all of the other teams in the Arcade mode, try to become the best player on the field in a Tournament, or for the ultimate challenge, try to make it to the championship by fighting through the Arena League Season. If you don\u0027t like the way your team is performing, edit the plays with offensive and defensive play editors. If you are a fan of the 50-yard indoor war, then get a copy of KURT WARNER\u0027S ARENA FOOTBALL UNLEASHED. \n \nKurt Warner\u0027s Arena Football Unleashed is a sports game developed and published by Midway for the Sony PlayStation. It was released in North America on May 18, 2000. It is of note that it would not be until 2006 before another AFL video game would be released. It is based around the fame of American football champion Kurt Warner. It is a modified version of NFL Blitz set in the Arena Football League. Arena ball is a version of American football played indoors on a 50 yard field with nets behind each endzone and boards on the sidelines. \n \nKurt Warner\u0027s Arena Football Unleashed differs from other American football video games due to its usage of the arena football system. A few rule changes include that there are half as many players on the field, field goals go back into play if they miss the goalposts, and there\u0027s no such thing as punting. The game is compared to NFL Blitz 2000 for its violence, and one reviewer even noted that \"The post-play violence has been pumped up to the level that Blitz had before the NFL forced Midway to tone it down.\" \n \nA Dreamcast version was announced at the same time as \"Arena Football\" prior to rebranding to \"Kurt Warner\u0027s Arena Football Unleashed\", however the Dreamcast version was cancelled for unknown reasons.",
