This led to increased border tensions, and soon small regional wars turned into a Global War, where all kinds of weapons were used, killing millions and destroying vast amounts of knowledge. As the use of nuclear weapons rendered many oil fields useless due to radiation, mankind had to turn away from fossil fuels, and eventually outlawed their use and turn to clean energy sources. \n \nDuring the war, China had broken up into several independent states, but thanks to their reliance in both old and new technologies, they bounced back, and under the hand of Emperor Zindo reunited, and went to control most of Asia. The United States, while had their population devastated, managed to hold their infrastructures and technology mostly intact, and had Mexico and Canada joining as new states, as well as a change in the constitution that changed the government into a private company, with certain special citizens being considered \"shareholders\". \n \nDue to the limitations of non-fossil energy sources, the control of a recently discovered material (Thermodux) that could amplify the power output of those energy sources is highly coveted. So, after an accident that killed the researchers and completing an hostile take-over of India Incorporated, Zendo announced a \"security attachment\" to \"protect\" the Solomon Islands (where Thermodux was being studied) from further terrorist threat. However, The US contracted a mercenary company, Navco, to clear the island, with the player joining as new recruit for the company, working for cash and shares in the US government. \n \nThe game is a typical flight combat simulator, with missions involving patrol, defense and attacking enemy facilities. The ultimate goal of the game is to survive each mission, taking down as many enemy aircraft as possible to collect a bounty, that can be used to purchase better weaponry and new crafts. The player should also avoid the destruction of USA-controlled facilities, as they carry a fine.","tags":[268435461,268435469]},{"id":50627,"name":"Hooked Again: Real Motion Fishing","platforms":[{"id":5,"name":"Wii"}],"summary":"Players once again cast, hook, and fight fish as they use their Wii Remote to reel in the big one in Hooked!

Unlike Heroes III, in Warlords importing extra scenarios or playing in multiplayer is prohibited.","tags":[17,268435471,268435472,536871138,536871208,536871327,536871938,536872835,536874094,536874694,536874830,536875257,536875455,536876847,536877767,536878073,536880744,536881021],"videos":[{"id":5831,"video_id":"Ni4hXNixnAM"}]},{"id":127543,"cover":{"id":188327,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co41bb.jpg"},"name":"Glitchangels","platforms":[{"id":48,"name":"PlayStation 4"},{"id":49,"name":"Xbox One"},{"id":130,"name":"Nintendo Switch"}],"screenshots":[{"id":371000,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc7y9k.jpg"},{"id":371001,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc7y9l.jpg"},{"id":371002,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc7y9m.jpg"},{"id":371003,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc7y9n.jpg"},{"id":371004,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc7y9o.jpg"},{"id":371005,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc7y9p.jpg"}],"summary":"Experience the thrill of retro arcade shooter action like never before in the pixel perfect arenas of Glitchangels by Pumpkin Games.","tags":[1,268435461,268435488,268435489]},{"id":138998,"cover":{"id":115133,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co2gu5.jpg"},"name":"Dedalus","platforms":[{"id":6,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}],"screenshots":[{"id":400630,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc8l4m.jpg"},{"id":400631,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc8l4n.jpg"},{"id":400632,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc8l4o.jpg"},{"id":400633,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc8l4p.jpg"},{"id":400634,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc8l4q.jpg"}],"summary":"Set on the island of Crete, as Mr. Snooze, face the minotaur, escape the maze and save sweet Akhenaten in Dedalus, created by the italian author Ivan Venturi.","tags":[17,22,268435458,268435487,536871982,536875671,536897062]},{"id":56178,"cover":{"id":111106,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co2dqa.jpg"},"name":"These Monsters","platforms":[{"id":3,"name":"Linux"},{"id":6,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"},{"id":14,"name":"Mac"}],"summary":"An experimental game inviting players to explore a procedurally-generated building.","tags":[268435487,268435488,536870984,536871220,536872405,536872407]},{"id":14345,"cover":{"id":162561,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co3hfl.jpg"},"name":"Breach 2","platforms":[{"id":13,"name":"PC DOS"},{"id":16,"name":"Amiga"}],"screenshots":[{"id":17967,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/x8zie9o5vj0d0qsdswwe.jpg"},{"id":17968,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/mc4xhbap7nzhmyzhjpyw.jpg"},{"id":17969,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/aaverkmqgzma4wrojbbm.jpg"},{"id":17970,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/b0qkuxi17ren90y0m8zz.jpg"},{"id":17971,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/r8bms9sdip9dgkmggcdy.jpg"}],"summary":"In 1987, Omnitrend Software released Breach amidst rave reviews praising it as \"...having much in common with cinematic science fiction such as Aliens\" - Compute Magazine.\n\nIt was said that \"With products like Breach, wargamers begin to see what the new, sophisticated machines can do.\" - Computer Gaming World.\n\nNow, Mindcraft introduces the new, enhanced version of Omnitrend Software's next generation of advanced role-playing combat, Breach 2.\n\nCommanding Your Squad: All vital mission data at your disposal.

The story was adapted in a limited comic book series published under the short-lived Acclaim Comics imprint.\n\nKiller Instinct features several gameplay elements unique to fighting games of the time. Instead of fighting enemies in best-of-three rounds bouts, each player has two life bars. The player that depletes the other player's life bars first wins the match. The game also introduced \"auto-doubles\", a feature which allows players to press a certain sequence of buttons to make characters automatically perform combos on opponents. Also featured in the game are \"combo breakers\", special defensive moves that can interrupt combos.","tags":[1,17,18,268435460,536871019,536897818,536901788],"videos":[{"id":8191,"video_id":"t2CR1LWGba8"}]},{"id":8317,"aggregated_rating":60.0,"cover":{"id":102145,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co26td.jpg"},"name":"WRC: Rally Evolved","platforms":[{"id":8,"name":"PlayStation 2"}],"screenshots":[{"id":7852,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/chxoodf29vpqdnu3imhe.jpg"},{"id":7853,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/ya9xvhelha6l98ef3971.jpg"},{"id":7854,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/lzbdl1bpxgp75jbfxkg4.jpg"},{"id":7855,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/brtzyjqedipknqitts8b.jpg"}],"summary":"Taste the physical extremes of rally driving and battle your way past your opponents in grueling multi-car wheel-to-wheel racing.

Ed is a mischievous being, though, who can't resist making the life of his poor brother-in-law as miserable as possible. There are thus two objectives: mess with the son's birthday gifts and ruin the performance of the hired entertainment troupe.\n\nThe player controls Ed from a third-person perspective and can explore a three dimensional environment that consists of the inlaws' house as well as their back garden. The gameplay is typical for an adventure game as Ed collects items that are stored in his inventory where they can be combined with others to create new ones. By using the items on certain objects in environment or on a character, cut-scenes are triggered that advance the story. Some characters can be talked to and the player then has to choose the dialogue option that will please the character. For each puzzle solved the player earns points. When stuck it is possible to use a help option which shows the direction to the object or character that the player needs to interact with next. When using it the player will not earn any points though."},{"id":18275,"aggregated_rating":71.6666666666667,"cover":{"id":154840,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co3bh4.jpg"},"name":"Pac-Pix","platforms":[{"id":20,"name":"Nintendo DS"}],"screenshots":[{"id":168141,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/ghwra2rxnmk92xszotyh.jpg"},{"id":168142,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/jxavbiiveodesuyuwxku.jpg"},{"id":168143,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/b7lpsp3qesmth8imovkp.jpg"},{"id":168144,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/ewci1bp6veqiupqjnabx.jpg"},{"id":168145,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/yjcpn31hkbcenffvom3y.jpg"},{"id":168146,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/ghmdgh2uxxymw0awt4hc.jpg"},{"id":168147,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/kjyr1dbcborklzj7vpqo.jpg"},{"id":168148,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/dmvsp0lfl9p4740tvo7f.jpg"}],"summary":"A mischievous magician, known for playing pranks on poor unsuspecting folks, created something known as \"Ghost Ink,\" a fluid that pretty much turns any drawing into evil and vicious ghost monsters.
