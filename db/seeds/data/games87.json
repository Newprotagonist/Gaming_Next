Final (loosely translated to \"Go by Train! Final\") is an electric train driving simulation game developed and published by Taito for the PlayStation 2 in Japan on May 27, 2004. It was later ported to the PC by Unbalance on December 17, 2004.\n\nPart of the Densha de Go! series, Final features a significantly upgraded graphics and audio, a revamped penalty system (using a point-based system from Densha de Go! Ryojou-hen and Densha de Go! Shinkansen), a combo-based scoring system, an improved Navigation System display, and unlockable route extensions.\n\nIn addition to standard play, the game includes an alternate play-style where players can instead (or alongside the driver player for two-player multiplayer) act as the train's conductor. Train Conductors must open and close the train doors at the correct time, choose the next correct station to stop at, and make in-car announcements.\n\nThe game includes four routes: the Yamanote Line, the Chūō Main Line, the Osaka Loop Line, and the Tōkaidō Main Line. Playable in both directions, it features the entirety of the Yamanote Line and Osaka Loop Lines, the Rapid section of the Chūō Main Line between Tokyo and Takao, and the section of the Tōkaidō Main Line between Kyoto and Kobe.\n\nThis version of the game was later ported to the PlayStation Portable in piecemeal, all part of the \"Densha de Go! Pocket\" line of releases:\n- Densha de Go! Pocket: Yamanotesen-hen (loosely translated to \"Go by Train! Pocket: Yamanote Line Edition\") was released on September 29, 2005, including only the Yamanote Line.\n\n- Densha de Go! Pocket: Chuuousen-hen (loosely translated to \"Go by Train! Pocket: Chūō Line Edition\") was released on January 19, 2006, including only the Chūō Main Line.\n\n- Densha de Go! Pocket: Osakakanjousen-hen (loosely translated to \"Go by Train!

The four heroines, Reimu Hakurei, Marisa Kirisame, Sanae Kochiya and Youmu Konpaku are finding this unusual. Depending on who you choose, one of them goes out to investigate.\n\nMAIN SCENARIO\nThe heroine first investigates in Hakugyokurou and encounters Yuyuko Saigyouji. The heroine accuses Yuyuko of not taking care of the spirits properly. Yuyuko has a small battle with the heroine. Yuyuko is defeated and states that they are actually 'divine spirits', and Yuyuko doesn't know much about them. Yuyuko suggests they may be from the graveyard of the Myouren Temple.\n\nAs the heroine heads to the temple, she runs into Kyouko Kasodani, the guard of the Myouren Temple. Kyouko is quickly defeated and the heroine heads on.\n\nThe heroine heads inside the temple.

As its name suggests, it was made to teach second grade students. It was replaced by JumpStart Advanced 2nd Grade in 2002.\n\nLike the previous JumpStart products, the game takes place in a school setting, but begins after school hours when a giant anthropomorphic frog named C.J. enters the classroom and frees a firefly named Edison. C.J. and Edison (Newton in the United Kingdom) form a double act of sorts with C.J. being an ardent, self-styled \"adventurer\" while Edison is the more pragmatic straight man, who frequently makes sardonic comments in response to C.J.'s grandiosity. The duo have appeared in many other JumpStart products, such as JumpStart Advanced 2nd Grade; however, their looks and personalities have both undergone enormous changes throughout the years.\n\nC.J. and Edison lead the user into a secret elevator hidden behind a bookcase. This elevator leads to several different floors, most of which are caverns beneath the school.

Enemies can, however, move in any direction, and auto-aim is utilized to allow the player to fire at nearby enemies or objects both inside and outside of the 2D plane. The player can use the right control stick to aim with a laser sight. Gameplay in Shadow Complex was inspired by Super Metroid and Castlevania: Symphony of the Night. The gameplay takes many cues from Metroid: the player can move freely throughout the expansive game world, defeating enemies with a variety of weapons, and as they overcome challenges, they gain new abilities and weapons which allow them to reach new areas.\nThe game rewards the player with experience points as they complete objectives and defeat enemies. The player can gain experience levels, each level boosting basic attributes of the character. These experience levels grant the player skills such as improved gunfire precision or damage resistance. Special rewards such as revealing the full map and unlimited special ammo are granted at specific levels. When the player starts a new game, they will lose all the weapons and items that they have acquired, but will keep the character's experience level and any benefits they have already received from that experience.\nIn addition to the main campaign, a number of challenge levels, called \"Proving Grounds\", are available, generally requiring the player to make it to the exit of a room using a limited set of items and health. Players are ranked based on time of completion and any scoring objectives when they complete the level. Scores and other statistics from the main campaign and the training group are tracked via online leaderboards.\nA remastered version and port was announced during the 215 Game Awards, to be released for PS4, Xbox One, PC.","tags":[1,18,39,268435461,268435464,268435487,536870933,536870984,536871079,536871213,536871389,536871470,536871501,536871506,536871707,536871878,536871882,536871931,536871937,536871945,536871971,536872010,536872064,536872098,536872205,536872550,536872695,536872715,536873030,536873067,536873236,536873352,536873362,536873425,536873973,536874115,536874398,536874653,536874706,536874743,536874745,536874813,536874843,536875042,536875046,536875052,536875059,536875073,536875081,536875084,536875091,536875095,536875099,536875151,536875170,536875196,536875197,536875199,536875223,536875229,536875231,536875243,536875244,536875245,536875249,536875271,536875286,536875298,536875303,536875305,536875308,536875309,536875315,536875322,536875326,536875330,536875340,536875344,536875358,536875372,536875396,536875437,536875438,536875455,536875464,536875483,536875484,536875490,536875491,536875501,536875502,536875511,536875523,536875524,536875532,536875537,536875538,536875545,536875546,536875549,536875550,536875554,536875565,536875572,536875623,536875624,536875649,536875682,536875691,536875695,536875705,536875743,536875745,536875803,536875804,536875815,536875822,536875852,536875885,536875896,536875903,536875904,536875912,536875941,536875951,536876009,536876014,536876015,536876018,536876021,536876023,536876028,536876062,536876097,536876121,536876122,536876129,536876183,536876191,536876214,536876220,536876221,536876261,536876266,536876273,536876277,536876283,536876318,536876325,536876353,536876359,536876361,536876368,536876378,536876414,536876415,536876447,536876474,536876504,536876521,536876528,536876545,536876552,536876625,536876650,536876654,536876666,536876685,536876687,536876703,536876723,536876724,536876752,536876757,536876833,536876862,536876874,536876875,536876910,536876919,536876938,536876995,536877035,536877040,536877151,536877170,536877179,536877180,536877230,536877234,536877253,536877263,536877294,536877332,536877352,536877373,536877429,536877451,536877529,536877532,536877533,536877540,536877560,536877561,536877604,536877666,536877775,536877950,536877966,536877972,536877994,536878004,536878032,536878071,536878483,536878487,536878544,536878598,536879194,536879232,536879714,536879934,536879959,536880072,536880090,536880324,536880865,536881281,536881972,536882121,536882445,536882512,536882549,536882666,536883347,536883398,536883865,536883948,536884049,536884121,536884122],"videos":[{"id":6351,"video_id":"b6wGaDmIkQY"}]},{"id":150606,"cover":{"id":191681,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co43wh.jpg"},"name":"The Last Ones Left","platforms":[{"id":6,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}],"screenshots":[{"id":476655,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sca7sf.jpg"},{"id":476656,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sca7sg.jpg"},{"id":476658,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sca7si.jpg"},{"id":476660,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sca7sk.jpg"},{"id":476661,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sca7sl.jpg"},{"id":476663,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sca7sn.jpg"},{"id":476664,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sca7so.jpg"},{"id":476665,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sca7sp.jpg"},{"id":476666,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sca7sq.jpg"},{"id":476667,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sca7sr.jpg"},{"id":476668,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sca7ss.jpg"}],"summary":"\"The LastOnesLeft\" is a first-person survival horror game where the player finds themselves in an abandoned village overrun by zombies.

When Remy finds himself in Paris near the restaurant of the famous deceased chef Gusteau, he works on making his dream of becoming a chef himself come true, while helping out his fellow rats to procure food.","tags":[34,35,268435464,536871670,536872475,536873096,536875054,536875074,536875292,536875294],"videos":[{"id":32850,"video_id":"duFlg4Y-yCc"}]},{"id":79050,"cover":{"id":202296,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co4c3c.jpg"},"name":"Hodj 'n' Podj","platforms":[{"id":6,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"},{"id":14,"name":"Mac"}],"tags":[17,268435465,268435491,536875240],"videos":[{"id":63178,"video_id":"Lac4mAFF8-U"},{"id":63179,"video_id":"8aOta1Pgd_A"}]},{"id":158290,"cover":{"id":164817,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co3j69.jpg"},"name":"FSX Steam Edition: Cessna C208B Grand Caravan EX Add-On","platforms":[{"id":6,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}],"screenshots":[{"id":544740,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scbobo.jpg"},{"id":544746,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scbobu.jpg"},{"id":544752,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scboc0.jpg"},{"id":544756,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scboc4.jpg"},{"id":544764,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scbocc.jpg"},{"id":544767,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scbocf.jpg"},{"id":544774,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scbocm.jpg"},{"id":544789,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scbod1.jpg"},{"id":544795,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scbod7.jpg"},{"id":544801,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scbodd.jpg"},{"id":544805,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scbodh.jpg"},{"id":544811,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scbodn.jpg"},{"id":544814,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scbodq.jpg"}],"summary":"It’s time to fly!
