Players get to start a band and hire band members who will play with them. Just like with real Lego, players can mix and match bodies, torsos, legs and heads to create a character any way they want. The main game has players touring around the world at various locations, like the original Rock Band games. Unlike Rock Band however, LEGO Rock Band also has special levels where you must perform outrageous tasks such as fighting an octopus or demolishing a building using your rock concert. As players make their way through the song lists, they earn \"Studs\", the game's currency. Studs can be used to purchase Lego items to decorate your Rock Den, hire new staff, buy new clothes or instruments.","tags":[27,268435463,536871262,536871322,536871400,536871577,536871627,536871669,536872205,536872964,536873064,536873065,536873455,536873847,536875049,536875054,536875073,536875157,536875244,536875245,536875257,536875271,536875364,536875456,536875563,536875611,536875725,536875751,536875781,536875802,536875822,536875849,536875941,536875943,536876084,536876100,536876101,536876199,536876266,536876566,536876721,536877108,536877187,536877406,536877513,536878071,536879696,536880134,536880316,536881010,536881459,536882369,536882370,536883103,536883461,536883593,536883779,536883865,536883872,536883980,536883994,536884355],"videos":[{"id":33080,"video_id":"B2itO1zSaXY"}]},{"id":175644,"cover":{"id":185263,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co3yy7.jpg"},"name":"Puzzle Art: Snakes","platforms":[{"id":6,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}],"screenshots":[{"id":660057,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sce5ax.jpg"},{"id":660061,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sce5b1.jpg"},{"id":660064,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sce5b4.jpg"},{"id":660066,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sce5b6.jpg"},{"id":660067,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sce5b7.jpg"}],"summary":"Minimalist, relaxing, picture logic, art - puzzle game with snakes.

A new 3D engine allows for visible damage and effects such as reflections and mud sticking to your car or truck. Speaking of vehicles, you select from a pool of ten with different ratings in power, top speed and weight. \n \nYou can also customize shocks, steering response, brakes, gearing ratios, transmission, tires (choose from all purpose, off-road, snow or slick) and even paint--both body and detail colors can be set to your liking. Yet the most notable addition is the track editor, which allows you to build your own course from scratch or modify an existing one to add more jumps, 90 degree turns, mud pits, and several other features. In total, there are 16 different track pieces you can position on an 8 x 8 grid using one of three themes: desert, snow or forest.

In August 2003, Microsoft purchased the rights to the High Heat franchise from 3DO, however, Microsoft has yet to develop a new title in the series.[2] \n \nHigh Heat was traditionally known for possessing more simulation-style qualities than competitors World Series Baseball, All Star Baseball, or Triple Play Baseball, but frequently lagged behind in graphical quality. At the core of High Heat′s gameplay was its batter-pitcher interface, which was often hailed as the most realistic of its era.[3]","tags":[32,268435470,536870932,536875570,536876141,536876146,536876147,536876148,536876149,536876151,536876152,536876153,536876154,536876155,536876156,536876157,536876159,536876165,536876190]},{"id":127923,"cover":{"id":87887,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co1vtb.jpg"},"name":"Resistance Element","platforms":[{"id":6,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}],"screenshots":[{"id":349407,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc7hlr.jpg"},{"id":349408,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc7hls.jpg"},{"id":349409,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc7hlt.jpg"},{"id":349410,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc7hlu.jpg"},{"id":349411,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc7hlv.jpg"},{"id":349412,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc7hlw.jpg"},{"id":349413,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc7hlx.jpg"},{"id":349414,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc7hly.jpg"},{"id":349415,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc7hlz.jpg"},{"id":349416,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc7hm0.jpg"},{"id":349417,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc7hm1.jpg"},{"id":349418,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc7hm2.jpg"}],"summary":"Resistance Element is a short, single player mod set in the Half-Life universe, tasking the player to overcome obstacles and help the resistance in their fight against the Combine.

Multiplayer games involve either taking it in turns on a single computer, or on a linkup.","tags":[32,268435466,268435469,268435470,536872060,536872078,536874337,536874813,536875069,536875117,536876108,536876749,536876772,536876773,536876774,536876775,536876776,536876777,536876778,536876779,536876780,536876781,536882382,536882383,536883816,536886476,536886704,536887000]},{"id":21596,"aggregated_rating":82.0,"cover":{"id":73672,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co1kug.jpg"},"name":"Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor - The Bright Lord","platforms":[{"id":3,"name":"Linux"},{"id":6,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"},{"id":14,"name":"Mac"},{"id":48,"name":"PlayStation 4"},{"id":49,"name":"Xbox One"}],"screenshots":[{"id":29187,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/rpisgm85xzupvfqxcivr.jpg"},{"id":110809,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/dovpnuja4spjbxgfaszv.jpg"},{"id":110810,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/mqko0s6novlf8c5zswyp.jpg"},{"id":110811,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/zgncmknqsdthntnkkjkl.jpg"},{"id":110812,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/odr5iivwgccwlhxtadbs.jpg"}],"summary":"Battle against Sauron as Celebrimbor, the great Elven Lord of the Second Age, to unlock powerful runes and the ability to wield the One Ring.","tags":[1,17,23,268435468,268435487,536871945,536873331],"videos":[{"id":9116,"video_id":"apqeGvr2m6A"},{"id":9117,"video_id":"nvoOZUV89GU"}]},{"id":110667,"cover":{"id":98407,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co23xj.jpg"},"name":"Death Voting Game","platforms":[{"id":6,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}],"screenshots":[{"id":263946,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc5nnu.jpg"},{"id":263947,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc5nnv.jpg"},{"id":263948,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc5nnw.jpg"},{"id":263949,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc5nnx.jpg"},{"id":263950,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc5nny.jpg"},{"id":263951,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc5nnz.jpg"},{"id":263952,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc5no0.jpg"}],"summary":"当红女星沈依然参加商业聚会不慎被人打晕，醒来发现被关在一个密闭空间，和她一样遭遇的还有另外五人，“囚禁？”“绑架？”还是有什么不可告人的阴谋？在神秘人的提示下得知出去的方式是投票，其他人是敌是友？真实情况是否又如神秘人所说？策略性文字冒险游戏，通过谨慎的选择，找出幕后真凶吧！","tags":[268435468,268435471,268435487,268435488]},{"id":9938,"cover":{"id":82230,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co1rg6.jpg"},"name":"Aarklash: Legacy","platforms":[{"id":6,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}],"screenshots":[{"id":31018,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/fczv4eqvgceawm9bohay.jpg"},{"id":31019,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/yhv9rhevref3sjcz5kvv.jpg"},{"id":31020,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/ncagwqx0oy2jvn6lnhvh.jpg"},{"id":31021,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/ftnpygtvdqmeigzdu1mk.jpg"},{"id":31022,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/btqk2jtxsezmzhfgoi0d.jpg"}],"summary":"In Aarklash: Legacy take command of a mercenary squad in search of truth and guide it through countless battles.","tags":[1,17,268435468,268435471,268435480,268435487,536871008,536871059,536871139,536871208,536871213,536871506,536871784,536871938,536871980,536872070,536872232,536872406,536872978,536873066,536873774,536874694,536874706,536874830,536874916,536875046,536875062,536875196,536875265,536875275,536875281,536875302,536875304,536875316,536875455,536875485,536875531,536875540,536875760,536875792,536876029,536876032,536876273,536876277,536876562,536876704,536876969,536876986,536877409,536877965,536879070,536879154],"videos":[{"id":9629,"video_id":"K7IpM7_hw9k"}]},{"id":15014,"aggregated_rating":50.0,"cover":{"id":77143,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co1niv.jpg"},"name":"DogFighter","platforms":[{"id":3,"name":"Linux"},{"id":6,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}],"screenshots":[{"id":38789,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/vfuzp2hbfwam3hfwfg60.jpg"},{"id":38790,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/oqz9azcycdovlezt5qn3.jpg"},{"id":38791,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/ipvs59hbjl5qiizx9gny.jpg"},{"id":38792,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/qiguuxolgyq5ukghs0lc.jpg"}],"summary":"DogFighter is a fast paced, arcade aerial combat game with arena style gameplay values.

Shape of the World offers a unique unfolding experience for those seeking an alternative to quest-driven adventure games.","tags":[17,268435463,268435469,268435487,268435488],"videos":[{"id":15296,"video_id":"dDn9cZ4jjiA"}]},{"id":8782,"cover":{"id":9737,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/tlhjxyeys9eashsubvpc.jpg"},"name":"The Last Federation: Betrayed Hope","platforms":[{"id":6,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}],"screenshots":[{"id":564297,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scc3ex.jpg"},{"id":564300,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scc3f0.jpg"},{"id":564305,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scc3f5.jpg"},{"id":564309,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scc3f9.jpg"},{"id":564310,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scc3fa.jpg"},{"id":564312,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scc3fc.jpg"},{"id":564313,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scc3fd.jpg"},{"id":564314,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scc3fe.jpg"},{"id":564315,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scc3ff.jpg"},{"id":564316,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scc3fg.jpg"},{"id":564317,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scc3fh.jpg"},{"id":564318,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scc3fi.jpg"}],"summary":"In this expansion you get two new modes, 17 new ships, 2 new solar system backgrounds, 32 new abilities, 19 new achievements, 13 new music tracks, and 5 new quests!","tags":[18,268435469,268435471,268435488]},{"id":14300,"cover":{"id":12843,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/c4msofpzxnqwr069zlzu.jpg"},"name":"Big Business","platforms":[{"id":13,"name":"PC DOS"},{"id":16,"name":"Amiga"}],"summary":"Big Busine$s a semi-realistic wacky business simulation!\n\nHave you ever wondered how it would be to run your own corporation?

The graphics are bright and beautiful, utilizing the PlayStation's capabilities to the fullest. The polygonal character models are huge and detailed, and the pre-rendered backgrounds are immaculately detailed. The music is composed and arranged by Yasunori Mitsuda, and features very realistic-sounding synthesizers.

It was afterwards released as a Super Famicom standard cartridge and also for the japanese Wii and Wii U Virtual Console.\n\nSutte Hakkun is a puzzle action game in the shape of a platformer. The playing character is an abundant-beaked bird resembling a penguin, named Hakkun, that is able to walk and jump but not to fly. The Rainbow of Happiness shined in the sky above Peaceful Islands: one day it broke apart and now Hakkun has to track down, collect, and put together all rainbow crystals to relive it. The gameplay hinges upon two elements: blocks and potions, the latter of several colours. Hakku makes its way through levels by changing the position of blocks — that will be done by swallowing them to release them on an other place then — and sucking potions — that are to be injected to blocks by the beak, endowing them with new properties consequential to the colour of the fluid — from jars. A level is cleared when the rainbow shards in it are collected. Neither a time limit nor enemy characters are there impeding Hakkun's way. Equally distinctive is the score system: a set number of points is given at the beginning of each level, and a decrease happens with any move made, thus rewarding the player for completing levels with as little moves as possible.","tags":[17,27,268435464,268435465,536871298,536873787,536875046,536875181,536875439,536896177,536898541,536901402,536902076],"videos":[{"id":57281,"video_id":"sfeDg8SG8Rg"},{"id":57480,"video_id":"Q3opMn4xAus"}]},{"id":19050,"cover":{"id":38916,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/dzr7b0wbfnt3vkpionxb.jpg"},"name":"JUMP","platforms":[{"id":6,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}],"screenshots":[{"id":90905,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/v3epe2leyfqldjmiyzx6.jpg"},{"id":90906,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/omfhuxlts66rpwcantb2.jpg"},{"id":90907,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/an9dbklejy2eccpzszox.jpg"},{"id":90908,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/rbza7zjlchxxxpfvcmha.jpg"},{"id":90909,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/leksw9otoyhqe4wgkto0.jpg"}],"summary":"JUMP, developed by Endeavor One Inc., enjoy the first large scale virtual reality jumping puzzle to utilize the awesome power of SteamVR!

Earth's remaining survivors began to seek refuge beneath small openings in the clouds, the few places light could be found. Those that remained in the 'dark earth' were hunted by strange creatures, infected with the darkness.\n\nTo shelter themselves from the dangerous 'dark earth', the people began to form cities beneath the light called 'Stallites'. At the time of the game, most of the citizens of the stallite have forgotten their history and now worship the light as a god. The stalites are run by 'Sun Priests', who maintain order and prevent the creatures of darkness from harming the city. The game follows the story of Arkhan, a \"guardian of fire\", protector of the stallite 'Sparta' and the Sun Priests.\n\nAfter an attack on the sun priests, Arkhan has a poison thrown into his face that begins to infect him with the dark sickness. He begins to mutate into a creature of the dark and has to find a cure before his transformation is complete. Along the way, he is treated as an enemy by most of his former friends while he struggles to uncover the conspiracy behind the attack.","tags":[1,17,18,22,268435460,268435465,268435487,536870981,536871041,536871139,536871470,536871818,536871889,536871939,536872225,536872234,536874727,536874743,536875067,536875199,536875265,536875331,536875358,536875437,536875523,536875621,536875755,536875762,536875803,536876490,536876505,536876875,536877453,536879188,536880250,536880256,536880747],"videos":[{"id":7236,"video_id":"gH0EB8kFbhs"}]},{"id":1178,"cover":{"id":101649,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co26fl.jpg"},"name":"Lufia II: Rise of the Sinistrals","platforms":[{"id":19,"name":"Super Nintendo Entertainment System (SNES)"}],"screenshots":[{"id":105039,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/fjrpawuehfz9izg7cl83.jpg"},{"id":163849,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/uplkvljuxtnxegpusin5.jpg"},{"id":163850,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/odcbhzbil84xudljsw4c.jpg"},{"id":163851,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/psagtydvfdyrkmigwc3o.jpg"},{"id":163852,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/vetqeckdvptbyezbnce3.jpg"},{"id":163853,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/gqlzt573zhobokoexpgk.jpg"},{"id":163854,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sr97fvxuhh4lcgr7idwx.jpg"},{"id":163855,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/ofmxzixnl86ye7zt6wlu.jpg"},{"id":163856,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/k50hzwhok0bkrgdw40ul.jpg"}],"summary":"This exciting sequel to the Lufian legend pits monster hunter Maxim and six adventuring companions against the sinister Sinistrals.

Played out in various locations throughout the solar system, the story examines both civil unrest in the colonies and an all-or-nothing genocidal invasion by the machines. Bipedal mecha known as HERCs are the mainstay of ground-based combat, and the focus of gameplay.\nHumanity is nominally united in an interplanetary Empire, led from Earth by the Immortal Emperor Solomon Petresun. Petresun's policy is the defence of Earth at all costs. While Earth is prosperous and well protected, the colonies on Luna, Mars, and Venus suffer from increasingly harsh regulations and production quotas. The combat units of the Empire are represented by the Imperial Police, Terran Defense Force and the Imperial Knights. The former paramilitary group is responsible for maintaining order in the colonies. The Terran Defense Force are the standard military with bases from Mercury to Titan. The Knights, led by Grand Master Caanon Weathers, are the military's elite and are provided with the best pilots and equipment.\nThe inequality between the colonies and Earth foments rebellion. In 2802 there are two guerilla movements on Mars, one that concentrates on destroying and capturing Imperial infrastructure and supplies and another bent on killing Imperial personnel and sympathizers. Both groups operate from underground bases and make do with modified mining HERCs and tanks. The rebels partially offset their disadvantages with superior weapons taken from the alien \"Tharsis Cache\"; an underground stockpile of alien technology discovered by rebels while digging new tunnels. Eventually the rebellion becomes too great for the police to contain and the Knights are deployed to Mars to crush the insurrection.\nThe Cybrids are a race of sentient robots responsible for the first Earthsiege. They are led by the first Cybrid, Prometheus, who is revered with god-like status. The Cybrids established themselves in the outer solar system after being defeated two centuries before during the first Earthsiege. Since then they have built up their strength for another bid to destroy humanity and claim Earth for their own. Like the Martian rebels, the Cybrids discover their own cache of alien weapons and adapt it to use, but their cache is inferior to the Tharsis Cache.\nThe game offers two story campaigns, with different endings. The Human campaign puts the player in control of a Martian rebel, initially fighting the Empire before humanity unites against the Cybrid invasion midway through the campaign. The human campaign culminates in an attack on Prometheus on Pluto. The Cybrid campaign starts with their invasion across the outer colonies and proceeds to Earth, ending in an assault on the Imperial palace to kill Petresun.","tags":[1,18,268435461,268435469,536871079,536871882,536872060,536872245,536872352,536875265,536875559,536875804,536876365,536879174,536880761,536884033],"videos":[{"id":4496,"video_id":"DF2t2faqV1I"}]},{"id":11828,"aggregated_rating":79.0,"cover":{"id":139311,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co2zhr.jpg"},"name":"7th Dragon III Code: VFD","platforms":[{"id":37,"name":"Nintendo 3DS"}],"screenshots":[{"id":12788,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/hzb8luvqxl3ew8zkrlov.jpg"},{"id":12789,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/w2s8o2rwuo3sznmmefed.jpg"},{"id":12790,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/mqaxemikm6szin1gn50r.jpg"},{"id":12791,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/nkhew2biaytzkqurlar9.jpg"},{"id":12792,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/tqugfoea6t6e1qpf5bh9.jpg"},{"id":151114,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/javnaevftz3epsfxg2jm.jpg"},{"id":151115,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/te1hfvwwhbifgu9pmu5t.jpg"},{"id":151116,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/yrhafoi5sdhfwbfnrbxv.jpg"},{"id":151117,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/al9cuyy2m3pnpfedt0er.jpg"},{"id":151118,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/yrtfzruyk0o6eblg2ce0.jpg"},{"id":151119,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/ahrwx0scab0trftwvjfl.jpg"}],"summary":"7th Dragon III Code: VFD is an upcoming game in the 7th Dragon series of Japanese role-playing games.

A large clock tower resembling a stone grandfather clock stood watch over the countryside of Marvel Land. Long ago, an ancient evil had been sealed within the clock tower. The people needn't fret, however. For those days had long since passed, or so they had thought.\n\nThe key of time that rested in the center of the face of the clock tower had long since been used to seal away the ancient evil that lies within. Until one day, the clock tower mysteriously stopped working. In an effort to rewind the clock, a villager takes it upon himself to do just that. Fumbling with the key, the villager drops the key of time, foolishly. In a frantic manner, the villager picks up the key and tries to reset it back into place before a catastrophe befalls Marvel Land. But then, it was too late for the villager to accomplish the task. The ancient evil of legend. Zouna, the Dark Wizard who manipulates time itself was unleashed upon the world once more. And to prevent anyone else from sealing him away once again, Zouna takes the key of time for himself.\n\nFinally freed after many years, Zouna wastes no time in wreaking havoc and chaos over Marvel Land. Zouna unleashes his manifested darkness over the land, and lays waste to the countryside. Feeling confident in his reign, Zouna constructs his castle in which to preside over Marvel Land from. The peaceful inhabitants of Marvel Land cried out in terror as Zouna's manifested darkness came after them one by one. Zouna's darkness corrupted the hearts of anyone it came across, and possessed them against their wills. Once thriving towns and villages fell into ruination. Family members were parted from their loved ones. Only a few scattered towns remained standing; forming a last bastion in resistance to Zouna's dark invasion. A futile effort. Even Krino Sandra (known as Whirlo in Europe) would come to meet his heroic demise, subdued by Zouna's power. Marvel Land is in dire need of a savior.\n\nThe desperate call has been answered by the heavens. Valkyrie, a fledgling shield maiden descends to Marvel Land from heaven.
