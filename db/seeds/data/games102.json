Most notably, it gives the player the ability to shape the game's world of Fa'Diel according to his or her desires, a system which was incorporated through the use of \"artifacts,\" which are gained as the player progresses through the game. The player uses the artifacts to create different towns, dungeons, etc., called \"Lands\", to venture to and explore. This creates a non-linear gameplay, since the game is driven by a series of what would be considered side-quests in other games. Legend of Mana features three different plots which can occur simultaneously, and which do not necessarily need to be completed for the player to finish the game.\n\nLegend of Mana was a financial success in Japan. While the game garnered considerable praise for its graphics and presentation, many critics and fans were turned off by the game's lack of a main storyline.","tags":[1,17,33,268435468,536870990,536871033,536871138,536871139,536871208,536871213,536871672,536871938,536872120,536872225,536872352,536872371,536872594,536872647,536872810,536872983,536873473,536874398,536875073,536875075,536875196,536875197,536875258,536875265,536875284,536875298,536875304,536875309,536875311,536875314,536875334,536875361,536875380,536875383,536875453,536875455,536875488,536875523,536875525,536875621,536875623,536875699,536875738,536875745,536875766,536875767,536875770,536875803,536875829,536875830,536875870,536875896,536875901,536875948,536875952,536876007,536876232,536876235,536876237,536876240,536876241,536876266,536876490,536876522,536876764,536876847,536876953,536876973,536876986,536876991,536877133,536877380,536877453,536877984,536878225,536878335,536878440,536878445,536879106,536880092,536880243,536881260,536885104],"videos":[{"id":6508,"video_id":"voXZwYb3Xa8"},{"id":6509,"video_id":"xfG_z1fGKZ0"}]},{"id":21547,"aggregated_rating":53.3333333333333,"cover":{"id":22432,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/e4m6mb64jvom2j0uszvl.jpg"},"name":"Trioncube","platforms":[{"id":20,"name":"Nintendo DS"}],"screenshots":[{"id":28936,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/p3ajqgrkyq4he3tqst0o.jpg"},{"id":177303,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/rfedwlbkp48otodgaals.jpg"},{"id":177304,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/nubjpfqr0qr3hw1yu7xi.jpg"},{"id":177305,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/lo4gbqivwru4qlhtsosq.jpg"},{"id":177306,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/tbyw3crnt9llilo5jfhc.jpg"},{"id":177307,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/zcuhbphui99q7xtd9dyc.jpg"},{"id":177308,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/liafp9c3mwzslji1hz1l.jpg"},{"id":177309,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/oilgcmdcuvpen26rifvu.jpg"},{"id":177310,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/y0pcxi5ciopagekp8xrt.jpg"},{"id":177311,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/hakx8x8m1zumvworzifn.jpg"},{"id":177312,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/ik9no1mffu10iwuljbvc.jpg"},{"id":177313,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/ld3o6c3y6c4psukxxlmj.jpg"}],"summary":"In Trioncube, the player must embark on a journey across eight planets into the depths of space, as the captain of the mighty space ship Penko, to rescue the princess from the grasp of Hell Metal.

of Ares\") is a fantasy-themed shoot-'em-up game released by Capcom as a coin-operated video game in 1986. The player takes control of a young soldier equipped with magical wings who must save the world from a malfunctioning supercomputer.\nLegendary Wings is set in a distant future where an alien supercomputer named \"Dark\", which has been helping human civilization achieve a new state of enlightenment since ancient times, has suddenly rebelled against mankind. Two young warriors are given the Wings of Love and Courage by the God of War Ares in order to destroy Dark and ensure mankind's survival.\nThe coin-op version of Legendary Wings can be played by up to two players simultaneously, with a second player being allowed to join the game at any time or even continue after a game over. The game's controls consists of an eight-way joystick and two buttons which changes depending on the context. The game consists of five areas with two different playing styles: the first segment in each stage is a top-view vertical scrolling segment in which the player flies across the sky, shooting at airborne enemies with their gun while dropping bombs at ground enemies, in order to reach the palace at the end of segment. When the player defeats the guardian and gains entrance to the palace, the game switches to a side-scrolling perspective, in which the player moves towards their goal on foot (by walking, crouching, and climbing ladders, as well jumping) until reaching the boss at the end, in which the player character will begin to fly with their wings again. In addition to the regular levels there are two optional levels that are accessible from the vertical-scrolling segment: a trap level in which the player is forced to escape from if they're sucked by the giant mechanical face on each area; and a hidden bonus level where the player can obtain various treasure chests to increase their score.","tags":[1,17,268435461,268435464,268435489,536871078,536871208,536875879,536876296]},{"id":24710,"cover":{"id":17853,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/zt5mudw4put1bt5om71j.jpg"},"name":"Driver: San Francisco - Deluxe Edition","platforms":[{"id":6,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"},{"id":9,"name":"PlayStation 3"},{"id":12,"name":"Xbox 360"}],"summary":"As John Tanner, take chase in a relentless manhunt through the City by the Bay.

Titans - now worshiped as gods - are cruel and uncaring. They bestow power on their most dedicated followers who, in turn, terrorize Pagan's population. To find a way back home, you need to become a Titan yourself before the Guardian succeeds in his plot to conquer Britannia--and then Earth itself.\n\nThe eighth installment of the Ultima series takes a much darker tone. The story is much more mature (do the ends justify the means?) and the game focuses more on action, like climbing and jumping across platforms. Training your character has also changed: the more you use an ability, the better you are with it. Without a party to assist you, you must rely on your own strength, dexterity, intelligence, and magical abilities to save Britannia and Earth.\nDark, engrossing story with a moral dilemma: will you accept evil for the sake of the greater good?\nMuch more action-oriented than previous installments with fluent and responsive combat mechanics and new ways to explore the unknown.\nLiving world: each inhabitant has his or her own schedule, going about ordinary business in Pagan.\nIncludes the speech pack: some of the major game characters are fully voiced.","tags":[1,17,268435468]},{"id":202109,"cover":{"id":223369,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co4scp.jpg"},"name":"Bullet Bill Simulator","platforms":[{"id":4,"name":"Nintendo 64"}],"screenshots":[{"id":797490,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sch3ci.jpg"},{"id":797491,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sch3cj.jpg"}],"summary":"A ROM hack of Super Mario 64.

In a desperate search to find a new home, they found Evath, a life-sustaining planet with two moons, Mitral and Tricuspid. They sent a ship, named \"Exodus\" to colonize this new planet with explorers, embryos and supplies. Generations passed, and the colony on Evath was formed. Without the rule of law, the oldest members of the Exodus' crew, the Elders, were forced to take control, form an army and bring the rule of law to Evath.\n\nLesleigh Skerrit aspired to work for the Driller Federation. His grandfather had been a member of the Federation, but he was falsely accused of murder and banished as a Ketar. Only later did the evidence contesting his guilt surface, but it was too late - the law did not allow someone banished as a Ketar to return to Evath. Lesleigh was not bitter and did not seek retribution. He wanted to study law to prevent this kind of mistake happening again.\n\nCalled in by his superior, Montigue Yarbro, he is offered a lifetime opportunity - to complete his training and gain a promotion to Elite within the Driller Federation in one fell swoop. His experience on Mitral bore him well - he was to go to Mitral and attempt to avert the coming catastrophe. Mitral, having been abandoned in its unstable state by the Ketars, was going to explode within four hours, and the explosion would take Evath with it. Skerrit's mission was to use the excavation probe \"Last Hope\" to place eighteen drilling rigs around Mitral to allow the gas to dissipate harmlessly into space and prevent this disaster. Things are not so simple though, with the security systems activated prior to the Ketars' departure.","tags":[1,18,268435461,268435471,268435487,268435489,536871113,536871162,536871882,536874694]},{"id":174441,"cover":{"id":183719,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co3xrb.jpg"},"name":"Fisher Online","platforms":[{"id":6,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}],"screenshots":[{"id":653850,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sce0ii.jpg"},{"id":653851,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sce0ij.jpg"},{"id":653852,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sce0ik.jpg"},{"id":653853,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sce0il.jpg"},{"id":653854,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sce0im.jpg"},{"id":653855,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sce0in.jpg"},{"id":653856,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sce0io.jpg"},{"id":653857,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sce0ip.jpg"}],"summary":"Fisher Online - online wild fishing simulator.

Seen a player hanging next to a precarious precipice. One single shot of your gun...and down he goes to his death.\nThere's just something so primal, so simple, so fun about that.\n\nPush is a Last Man Standing gameplay modification replicating exactly that. In Push, your goal is simple: Knock enemies off onto instant-death floors, and stay on the arena as long as possible. Gameplay emphasizes skill and quick reflexes above all else. Get accurate and knock enemies off into pits. Figure out how to survive being thrown into the abyss. Think fast and act faster, and you just might be the last one standing.\nYou're given absolute minimal equipment so you can focus on strategy. Laser guns that do no damage but have extremely high knockback, Primary fire shoots a laser that doesn't do a lot of push, but is very accurate and very, very fast. Secondary fire lobs an energy grenade that has short range and arcs downward, but has massive amounts of knockback and can rocketjump like nothing else. Gauntlets that can send people careening off into the distance with a single (lucky) blow. And a double-jump to help with recovery.\n\nIt's all so simple. So, so simple. And it's short, too--matches barely last any longer than three minutes. Any longer, and drones come in to mop up whatever people remain.\nInterested in some popcorn fun?

When their vehicle is reached, the time limit is extended; the vehicle must be rammed a number of times until the criminal is forced to stop, then is arrested. \n \nThe game includes five levels. As both the initial time limit to reach the criminal and the time extension to ram the criminal are just 60 seconds, the game is very short - a player who is able to finish the game on one credit will enjoy at most ten minutes of game-play. \n \nInterestingly enough when Nancy at Chase HQ (at the start of every level) calls on the radio the frequency is always 144.X (various)Mhz.

Strikes, riots and crime were rampant, and all available law enforcement were brought to the cities leaving the outlands vulnerable. A foreign multinational oil consortium, Oil Monopoly Alliance Regime (OMAR), was determined to monopolize the world oil trade. The U.S. was the last country that stood in their way and they were prepared to go to any length to bring the U.S. to its knees.\nOMAR hired Sid Burn, a professional terrorist, to push the U.S. economy over the edge. Sid began to organize his troops in the remote areas of the southwest. Calling themselves the \"Coyotes,\" they began to target oil refineries, commercial installations and other vital industry throughout the region. With the law enforcement in the cities, some desperate civilians began to take the law into their own hands. Led by a trucker named Convoy and referred to simply as the \"Vigilantes,\" this oddball group soon became a major hindrance to Sid.\nMeanwhile, the U.S. government, feeling more vulnerable than ever, was intensifying its research and development of a new military arsenal. The most advanced weaponry, rumored to be based on UFO technology, was located at Site-4, a secret facility at Papoose Lake. This information was not lost on Sid, and the Coyotes ambushed the facility. However the Vigilantes unexpectedly appeared to stop them and as a result, both parties found themselves in possession of the world's most advanced weaponry.\nWhat followed were no ordinary skirmishes. Auto clashes ensued all over the land, from Colorado's Rockies to California's farmlands, only to culminate in a battle like no other. To this day the events which took place are only a matter of speculation.","tags":[1,17,22,268435460,268435461,536870915,536870937,536872225,536872352,536872581,536874398,536874539,536875067,536875198,536875610,536875715,536877938,536878107,536878265,536878277,536878439,536880356,536880441,536881476,536881979,536884032,536884420,536884863,536897818,536899617]},{"id":17815,"aggregated_rating":59.0,"cover":{"id":168490,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co3m0a.jpg"},"name":"Battle Of Europe","platforms":[{"id":6,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}],"screenshots":[{"id":92553,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/yznln9hnfyqju1ay8u6s.jpg"},{"id":92554,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/gfse2vjiszvoav1b1zs4.jpg"},{"id":92555,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/zmkkpkrm62xdlohi6bim.jpg"},{"id":92556,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/qo0m2bszkaa63jiag04e.jpg"},{"id":92557,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/x8xiispezcdvdqvotpmp.jpg"}],"summary":"Risk your life in countless dog fights, returning home in a smoking plane full of bullet holes!

Players are given control of a small squad of characters (six or less) and placed on a grid-based map resembling a geographical location (a swamp, a town, a river), upon which they fight battles to progress through the game. As with most T/RPGs, positional advantage can be critical to victory, and players are encouraged to outmaneuver their enemies as well as outgun them. The game emphasizes positioning and maneuvering by the inclusion of \"Formation Arts,\" which increase attack damage when an enemy is surrounded by your characters in a line, a triangle or a circle. Wild Arms XF is a member of the small subsection of T/RPGs whose battlefields are based around hexagonal tiles instead of squares. \"Combination Arts\" return from previous Wild ARMs titles, allowing characters to target an enemy in a waiting state and then deliver their attacks simultaneously with the next ally to attack their target. If the player succeeds in executing an uninterrupted series of commands, the damage inflicted upon enemies will increase significantly.
