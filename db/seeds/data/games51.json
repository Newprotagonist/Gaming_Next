    "summary": "Sesame Street: Big Bird\u0027s Hide and Speak is a game for the Nintendo Entertainment System. It was one of the simplest-to-play NES games ever released commercially. This game stars Big Bird and co-stars Little Bird, and features Bert, Ernie, The Count, Grover, and Elmo. This game was developed by RSP Inc. and published by Hi Tech Expressions. All 4 sides of the D-pad move little bird to the next window clockwise; A and B Buttons both choose a window. The center buttons (Start and Select) exit to the game select screen. The game\u0027s objective was to choose the correct character or letter, with six different levels. The first two levels are based on simply choosing the window instructed by Big Bird, while the next two needed memorizing since the windows close. In the fifth level the player had to spell the three-letter word instructed by choosing the right letters and the last level the player must attempt to spell the most number of different words before a time limit, the letters in the windows changing after a new word is created.",

In critical situations, the meek Dexter can transform into his mighty alter ego Space Ace. Thus empowered, he has to defeat Borf’s minions. \n \nSpace Ace II is a essentially a cartoon strip in which our hero will encounter numerous hazards. You have to avoid traps and enemies by pressing the right key at the right time: cursor keys for movements, Insert key to shoot. You never control Dexter directly, you just choose an appropriate direction. Each of the 27 seconds-long scenes requires one to three keystrokes. If your decision is wrong, the cartoon will end with a death animation, and Dexter will lose one of his three lives. So you’re basically trying to keep the strip running. Timing is crucial; you will need to press keys in the exact second. Luckily, you’re allowed to save your progress at four fixed points. \n \nSpace Ace II is ported to the PC from the original arcade Laserdisc version. The result is a cut version due to space restraints. Although Space Ace II comes on 12(!) low density 5 1/4\" discs, most scenes are shortened noticeably.",

Her task is to get a briefcase. While trying to get that briefcase at the Sainsbury Station, she met her presumed dead ex-husband again, who is now working for the other side. To make matters worse, she also get shot by a sniper. Now Alice has to find out what\u0027s about the briefcase, what her ex-husband has to do with it and who shot her. \n \nFate by Numbers is a film-noir Interactive Movie mixed with a point\u0026click Adventure system. \n \nAfter the intro you start in your office. Like all other places in the game, the locations are \"static\" - you have animations here and there, but you can\u0027t walk around. Alice always stands on the same place. But of course you can interact with the environment on fixed locations, including looking at, using it, talking to or using any equipped stuff. If the action is not possible (i.e. talking to the computer), Alice will say so. Otherwise, almost all other actions resulting in full motion video-sequences - leaving a building, \"driving\" with your car, speaking with people, breaking in buildings, hacking in computers etc. An exception for example is analyzing photos in your computer, there you must manually looking for clues by zooming parts of the photos. \n \nWhen leaving places, you are presented with a city map showing the current places you can visit. The places grow over time, but a few are only there briefly (i.e. breaking in the surveillance centers server room).",

Similarly to Kung-Fu Master or Rush\u0027n Attack, the player jumps by holding the joystick upwards instead of having a dedicated jump button like other side-scrolling action games. Instead, one button is used to swing the sword at enemies and the other button is used to hold the shield to block enemy attacks, including projectiles such as throwing knives and arrows. The shield can be held towards the player while standing or crouching, as well as upwards vertically and diagonally. Some enemies will throw magic balls which will cause the player to lose their sword and shield if they block. During these instances, the player will fight barehanded, with the sword and shield buttons used to punch and kick respectively. The sword and shield will appear on-screen after some point, allowing the player to recover their weapon. Other power-ups includes floating hearts that will restore the player\u0027s health and jumping spots where the player can jump higher than usual.\n\nThe game consist of six stages, where the player will face the usual series of small fry enemies, as well as a sub-boss at the middle of each stage and a boss at the end. The player is allowed to start the game at any of the six stages. However, the player must play through the entire game again after defeating the final boss, Achilles, in order to see the true ending (similarly to Ghosts\u0027n Goblins). The player can continue after a game over depending on the dip switch settings.",

There are coins to collect. Collecting a coin will reset the timer and add to your money. You can use the money you earn to buy upgrades. You can upgrade your speed, the timer, your bullet damage (First upgrade unlocks shooting), the coin worth, shooting reload time, and the enemy worth. When you collect $500 in a single game, the boss will appear and you will have to defeat it. \n \nYou start off with a very low speed and a timer that is three seconds long. If the timer runs out then you will lose. The timer restarts every time you collect a coin. Enemies will start coming in from off-screen. As you collect the coin, the speed of the enemies will change. You can\u0027t shoot them yet because you have to unlock it by upgrading the bullet damage upgrade. So, you will have to try avoiding them until the first bullet damage upgrade is purchased. Each coin you collect will not only reset the timer, but it will also add more to your money which you can use to buy more upgrades. Upgrades are awesome. \n \nOh yeah, by the way, after you reach $500 in a single game the boss will appear. Defeat the boss to complete the game. Maybe you\u0027ll get a trophy or something?

    "summary": "Swordplay and puzzles combine in this thinking man\u0027s dungeon crawl. It\u0027s simple to learn, with just a handful of commands to master. But the unique gameplay provides an amazing depth. A detailed overhead view shows monsters, obstacles, and other game elements. You have as much time as you like to contemplate your next move. So this is a good game for relaxing, but also terrifically involving once you get started. You\u0027ll be hooked by the story of Beethro and his troublesome nephew, Halph. Our heroes set off on a harmless jaunt, but end up far below the surface, chased by a clownish madman. They begin to uncover a vast, underground bureaucracy, and things only get stranger the further they delve. You\u0027ve got over 350 rooms ahead--each one a singular challenge for you to conquer.",

    "summary": "A platform game where the main character travels throughout various levels collecting bombs. The hero of the game, Jack, must make his way through 16 levels of a pyramid in order to defeat the demon Belzebut and rescue the royal Pamera family.Each level is split into two parts an action zone and a Royal Palace room. The mechanics and level designs of the Royal Palace rooms are directly lifted from the games prequel, Bomb Jack. Action zones can be split up into several portions, and contain power-ups usually hidden in treasure chests such as money bags, Mighty Coins and Mighty Drinks. Mighty Coins allow Jack to change colors blue allows Jack to open orange treasure chests, orange allows him to open any treasure chest by simply touching it from the side, and green transforms all enemies on the screen into coins for 5 seconds. Mighty Drinks add 10 seconds to the games timer. Secret passages can also be found in the action zones, activated by finding a Sphinx in a visible or hidden treasure chest.To prevent the player from becoming too greedy, the game automatically sends the player to a Torture Room if they obtain more than 9 Mighty Coins or 99 seconds on the games timer. The only way to escape a Torture Room without losing a life is to complete a number of jumps, which are counted down on the screen. Once the player exits the torture room, Jack automatically loses all Mighty Coins, the timer is reset to 60 seconds, and the game recommences from the beginning of the current level.A Royal Palace room NES version.A Vs. Series version of the game was released in 1986 for the Japanese market not to be confused with the original dedicated arcade version. Differences between the original and vs. series versions include adding a two-player mode, changing the locations of some secret passages and removing a warp trick in the Royal Palace rooms. In the NES version, Jack could warp forward to the next Royal Palace room if he touched the first lit bomb in the current room after the other 23 bombs were collected however, if Jack died in the warping process, he would be sent back to the beginning of the level from which the trick commenced.Mighty Bomb Jack also had a guest appearance on Tecmo Super Bowl, during the halftime show in the Super Bowl",

The player\u0027s task is to completely cover the scene in plants. As you overgrow the objects, a meter fills to show your progress. You are given objects to expand the scene.

The bikes themselves of course, with 39 different Ducati models included in the game, 29 of which have never before been seen in this context, divided into 7 eras, from the 1950\u0027s to the latest, high-performance Bologna-built bikes. You can race with the legendary 125 Desmo (1958) or with the 500 Pantah (1970), the beautiful 750 F1 (1980), but also with the first Monster 900 (1990) or the various evolutions of the \"naked\" par excellence, such as the high-performance Monster S4RS Tricolore. The Superbikes had to be incorporated of course and include the 848 (2000) and the highly exclusive 1199 Panigale Superleggera (2014), as well as the Desmosecidici GP15 ridden by Andrea Doviszioso and many Ducati production milestone models.",

There are items you can collect along the way, but there are also hazards and obstacles designed to mess with your progress. There are only two game modes, one on a regular course with no items (sort of like a survival mode), and a special mode where there are items and obstacles to face. You can also play in the special mode against a second human player. It can be fun, albeit tough to put down, so give it a try!",

In addition to traditional Arcade, Versus, Time Attack, and Practice modes, Battle Fantasia also features a Story mode that provides RPG-style dialogue and detailed information about the lives of each of the ten main fighters. Gamers must learn to master counterattacks and the energy-gauge depleting Heat mode in order to advance through scenarios and unlock hidden illustrations, but those simply looking for a quick battle can also head online for head-to-head matches against a friend.",

This is the only time when Zeke Dunbar makes a cameo appearance and Dr. Sebastian Wolfe\u0027s brother Raymond Wolfe appears in a cameo as well.\n\nAfter completion of Cole\u0027s Legacy, the Cole\u0027s original bike courier jacket is awarded for in-game use. The design of the jacket is slightly different compared to the first two games of the series. In this game, the design of the jacket shows some tears in the front and the back of the jacket and rather than the yellow pads being sewed up on top of the black jacket, the yellow and the black are sewn together imitating as a jacket pad-less. There are also some more minor changes such as the zipper on the jacket is also revealed due to Delsin wearing it without zipping it up and covering it, and also small changes to the collar area of the jacket.\n\nSince June 25, 2014, European Infamous: Second Son players can now access the Cole’s Legacy’ DLC from the PlayStation Store",

The prologue is linear: the player has to survive the conflict between the Tyi (technology) and the Genides (biology). He handles missions for both factions and once he reaches level 6 he has to decide which side he wants to support in the future. Then the game becomes more open without story progression. In friendly space stations the player can accept missions which mostly result in grinding: killing a certain amount of enemies, scanning a certain amount of planets or flying to checkpoints. Most of those quests are in instances, i.e. in a especially loaded sector without other players, but there are also PvP and group missions for up to four players.",
