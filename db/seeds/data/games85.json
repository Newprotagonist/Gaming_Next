If the game becomes too hard you can make it easier with your two in-game abilities slow and blink.\n\nSlow ability- allows for the player to slow down everything except for the player itself. \nBlink ability- allows you to jump a short distance. If you manage to time it right, you can even jump through some of the obstacles in the game.\n\nThese cool little tricks will have to be used on some levels to push you a bit closer to that medal.

In addition to that, Abnormal features the ability to instantly switch between two different time periods in the mansion you are exploring which will come in handy for puzzle solving. \n \nAbnormal will feature optional support for Head Mounted Displays such as Oculus Rift and HTC Vive which will immerse you in the heart of fear.",

Armed with hand crafted weapons and bad jokes, can the four nerds survive, defeat three almighty tyrants and find their way home? \n \nDoom \u0026 Destiny Worlds is an indie turn based jrpg with a vibe of Dragon Quest Builders, including large explorable open world, tactic combats and equipment crafting/management. \n \nOne of the peculiar aspects of the game is that despite the turn based battles, it allows a fully fledged local cooperative multiplayer mode, where the turn based battles take place in the same screen as the main exploration, allowing players and monsters to join a battle that is already started, or leave a battle in the heat of combat while other still fight. \n \nThe main plot revolves around the exploration of three main worlds to find the location and gain access to the world\u0027s Tyrant to defeat him in battle. Exploration in open-world style with the strenght of enemies and players limiting the movement to only same-or-lower level fights. \n \nCharacters can craft various gear to help in their quest, and this is also the main way to gain power. Level increase through battle unlocks more equipment tiers, wich in turn unlocks powers and bigger stats. A level 20 naked character will more or less fight at the same level of a naked level 1 character. \n \nCrafting gear happens at crafting stations where the player can combine over 20 different materials with gear blueprints to get a combination of bonuses unique to that particular combination. A stone helm will need strength to handle, but will provide more protection than one made of magic crystals, wich in turn will be way more useful to increase the mana pool of the character.",

You have to play for the girl Maya, the flight engineer from the cargo ship, who suddenly found herself held captive by unknown creatures in an secret research facility on Titan - Saturn\u0027s satellite. Your goal will be to escape from Titan, and if possible, and save some of the prisoners in this place people. \n \nBriefly about the features of the current version: \n \n- At the moment the game is completely without sound. The voice acting is being prepared and in the next versions it will certainly appear. \n- The saving system has not yet been implemented. In the case of the death of a character, all game progress is lost and the game will have to start anew. However, do not despair, because at the moment the gameplay will take 10-15 minutes :) \n- As mentioned above, there may be numerous glitches, errors and other amenities of the alpha version. I will be glad to hear about all such finds in the comments here. \n \nGame Management: \n \nAWSD - movement \nSpace - Jump \nRight mouse button hold - overview \nW + Left Shift - running \nE - use, pick up \nR - hack \nEsc - main menu \nP - character parameters window \nG - settings window \nM - map \nKeys 1-6 - use the item in the appropriate cell inventory \nKeys 1-6 + Left Shift - discard an item from the corresponding inventory cell",

No way. It\u0027s above average, at least. No, wait - so way above average that it\u0027s pure awesome. That\u0027s more like it.\n\nExplodemon! is unrelenting, hard-core brain-tickling action for those who grew up playing platformers, as well as those who\u0027ll discover just how awesome they were.",

    "summary": "The core game and story for both Ico (2001) and Shadow of the Colossus (2005) remain unchanged with the remastered versions. For the remastering, both games have had a graphical overhaul to allow them to support modern high-definition displays up to 1080p. With the more powerful PlayStation 3, both games feature a fixed frame rate of 30 frames per second; the original PlayStation 2 version of Shadow of the Colossus was noted for pushing the limits of the older console and often suffered from framerate losses. Both games support stereoscopic 3D, taking advantage of the original design of the games with considerations towards depth-of-field viewing, as evidenced by the large landscapes. Both games in the collection support 7.1 surround sound.\n\nIco\u0027s remastering is based on the European version, which features additional content that did not make it into the North America release of the original game, as well as some altered puzzles from these original releases. Specifically, upon completing the game, the player can restart to see the English translations of the mysterious language that Yorda, the player character\u0027s companion, uses, and a two-player mode with the second player in control of Yorda. Though there was consideration for inclusion of PlayStation Move motion control support, it was not released with it.\n\nThe collection includes bonus content, including two XMB Dynamic Themes and exclusive video content for Ico, Shadow of the Colossus, and Ueda\u0027s next game, The Last Guardian.",

Feedback given to Codemasters was that players only played the game when they had a few hours to play. In response, Codemasters brought in this mode so that players could simply play for a short amount of time. In this mode the player will start as a team lower down the field, and over a ten race season the player will move teams mid-season, depending on their ability to beat rival drivers and objectives.\nCodemasters also introduced \"One-Shot Qualifying\", whereby a player has a single lap to qualify for the race. The three stage knock out session is still an option, however the single 20 minute session is no longer available in career mode. There is no longer an option to include all three practice sessions in a race weekend, but instead only a single hour session is available.",

    "summary": "A great selection package has been introduced that allows four types of RPG to be enjoyed at once. \n \nAsdivine Menace \nA century after the events of Asdivine Dios, peace has finally settled in. That is until a visitor from another world suddenly shows up proclaiming the entire universe is about to be destroyed. Hearing this, Izayoi sets off in an attempt to reverse this seemingly pronounced fate with a trio of very idiosyncratic spirits as they criss-cross four worlds in search of an answer. But what is the answer they find...? \n \nExperience immersive turn-based battles with cooperative attacks and new limit break skills! With all quests, collecting and crafting, the battle arena, and even post-game content, Asdivine Menace comes packed with enough elements to satisfy JRPG-hungry gamers. As Izayoi deepens his bonds of trust with his spirit companions, their fates together move in new and meaningful directions! \n \nWizards of Brandel \nThe young wizard Darius loses his house after he fails to make a loan repayment, and ends up living for free in the house of a wanted sorcerer! As he meets a female swordsman who has absolutely no sense of direction, and a plant girl who shrivels up immediately if she doesn\u0027t drink enough water, fate decrees to end up traveling together. Where will the quarrels over differing principles lead to? \n \nUnleash continuous attacks with Limit Burst in turn-based battles and form partnerships with the Familiar Spirits! The Magic Lab lets you power up your skills and you can also enjoy setting fields, dowsing areas, and visit side-job rooms to get items at the Magical Garden! Furthermore, explore towns and secret dungeons, experience all the achievements you know and love, such as weapon strengthening, item crafting, and the arena! \n \nSeek Hearts \nWith questions swirling in his mind about why he was created and by who, Izen sets out on a journey to discover his origins. However, as he and those with him pursue answers to this mystery, they fail to notice a shadow creeping up upon them with the intent to stop them in their tracks... \n \nUpgrade Izen\u0027s abilities with arm/leg parts, core and chips, and activate the armament drive and fight with the support of fairies! Add a little spice to life with titles and enjoy the free arrangement of battle speed and encounter rates! Get easy items from fairies that hide in stockings! Loads of extra content including a battle arena and more still awaits! \n \nInnocent Revenger \nMiden Tower is a fantasy RPG with a compelling and dramatic story. After Miden Tower is invaded by the Alroval Empire, the mages who call it home find themselves cornered on its upper floors. This sets in motion a series of tragic events that lead to a counteroffensive being launched to take back the tower and to get revenge for the wrongs committed against them. \n \nThe heroine is an actual wall that provides support to the main characters by merging with walls or acting as a windbreaker if needed. Turn-based battles can be engaged with 3x3 grid battles by using skills with different effects or by summoning golems to take down your foes. Alchemize items, learn passive skills, and enjoy the tons of quests and extra enjoyment that await in this magical adventure!",

The Earth’s forces were triumphant in battle and the Grein forces fled the Solar System. However, as they retreated, the Grein left behind a secret underground base filled with self-replicating Grein machines. \n \nForty-two years after the Earth’s victory, the Grein base opened and a new attack force decimated the city of New Age. To retaliate, Earth’s military has stored a mecha that specializes in alien combat known as the Zeoth. It is the Zeoth’s assignment to stop the attack force, go into the Grein secret base and destroy the mechanical occupants before a new invasion force arrives.",

Free Play is exactly as one would expect, and Daily Dojo is a once-a-day challenge on a random song you\u0027ve unlocked. There are four difficulties: Flower, Bamboo, Tree, and Demon. Demon difficulty, also known as Oni Mode, is initially hidden and must be unlocked. In addition to the actual gameplay, you can also dress up your Taiko character in silly outfits. This does not affect actual gameplay and is only a visual change. There is also a multiplayer mode available. It can be played in single-cart mode, but if an opponent has a copy of the game the outfit they have dressed their Taiko in will appear on whatever character corresponds to which player they are.\n\nThe game comes with two \"Bachi Pens\", which are Taiko no Tatsujin-themed styli for use with the game, and is rated A on the CERO rating system (the Japanese equivalent of an E for Everyone on the ESRB rating system).",

The player acts as an officer in charge of managing the virtual space, and aims to normalize the people he or she contacts while observing the life of any \"avatar\" living there, to protect the avatar from frequent attacks by obstructionists, and to collect and redistribute the feelings of happiness and unhappiness that they emit, in order to achieve a certain level of happiness for all people. Avatar behavior changes in response to happiness and can be influenced by other avatars involved in life. That is, even with the same avatar, life can change depending on the degree of happiness of the other avatars that are actively acting or negatively distressed by the sense of well-being during observation, or are involved with or in contact with other avatars that were previously offline. The interaction between people is called \"human scramble\" on the package and official website. Each avatar lasts about 20 minutes, and you can watch the same avatar over and over again.\n\nThe whole story is represented by 3DCG, but the avatar is represented by flat shading (a projection method that looks like an angular figure with fine planes). Avatar conversations and thoughts are expressed as text, and their voices are expressed as indistinct voices.",

There\u0027s also a large amount of alternative features these hacks offer, which range from differences to the Pokémon themselves to the presence of a couple new TMs.\n\nAdditionally, the two versions only differ in terms of their aesthetic differences, such as the appearance of Opelucid City, the title screen, etcetera.

    "summary": "Mario Party 8 is the eighth installment of the Mario Party series on a home console and the first Mario Party game for the Wii. Mario Party 8 is notable for its strong use of the Wii Remote and its motion control capabilities in minigames. Players are required to perform various gestures instead of traditional button/joystick controls. Common motions include pointing-and-shooting, shaking, waving, turning, and twisting the Wii Remote. Player-created Miis are featured in this game, wherein they often show up within crowds. Miis can appear in certain minigames and may also serve as the player\u0027s character in Extra Mode. By playing regular party games, minigames, and completing the Star Battle Arena mode, players will earn Carnival Cards, which may be spent to unlock figures and game features.",

Does that make those who lose or abandon such ideology less than human—does it make them limbless maggots?\n\nIf so, then this tale is devoid of humans—it is a tale of maggots. Crawling to survive, like the maggots we are.\n\n​Maggot baits​, winner of the 2015 Moege Awards Top Fetish game, is the newest title from ClockUp, the studio that brought us the infamous erotic thriller, ​euphoria. Do you have what it takes to stomach this dark and violent tale, maggot?",

    "summary": "Broken Sword 2.5: The Return of the Templars is a fan made sequel to continue the storyline after the first two games in the Broken Sword adventure series, and ties up the events leading up to the third game. Like the first two games, a 2d view is used with point-and-click gameplay instead of the full 3d from the later games.\n\nFamiliar locations all over the world are mixed with new settings and characters. George, Nico and André all return, but new ones such as Christophe Brai and English historian Jimmy McLaugh also play an important role. Movement is done with the mouse, while the cursor changes automatically to an available action when hovering over a hotspot. Items are stored in an inventory and dialogues trees are shown as icons representing items or characters. Players will control George and Nico intermittently throughout the story. It is also possible to die in the game.\n\nAlthough it is a tribute to the original series, the production values are high with entirely new environments, characters, rendered cut-scenes, sounds and a storyline that match the original games. Some people involved with the original game have contributed and there is full German (with a few of the voices of the original games) and English voice acting.",

There\u0027s no weapons, though, it\u0027s just you and the open road ahead.",

It soon turns out that the Empire is after another legendary sword, Lumina, so Musashi\u0027s first task is to get it before the bad guys do!..\n\nBrave Fencer Musashi is an action game with strong RPG elements. Controlling Musashi, the player explores the pre-rendered backgrounds from third person view (similarly to Final Fantasy VII), visiting towns, talking to NPCs, etc. There is a day/night cycle in the game, which is manifested in the schedules of NPCs and/or monsters, as well as Musashi\u0027s fatigue level, which increases if he doesn\u0027t sleep enough. Musashi uses the two swords, Fusion and Lumina, to fight his enemies. The two swords have different properties: while Fusion behaves more or less like a traditional melee weapon, Lumina needs to be imbued with various elemental items in order to unleash powerful attacks.",

    "summary": "Math is boring, so they say. Well, no more. Math Classroom Challenge is an educational game in first person view, with the mission of solving the different random mathematical exercises proposed. To do this, you have at your disposal a water hose, with which you must water the numbers and the appropriate solutions. All this in a safe environment to learn mathematics in a fun and enjoyable way. It\u0027s also the kids version of Math Combat Challenge. Math Classroom Challenge is designed for children over the age of four. In the game the player can do several activities: learn the numbers that fly, learn how to throw the water, solve the static panels looking for the corresponding numbers, and solve the dynamic panels that appear suddenly with three solutions. Always throwing the water from the hose to the correct solution. In Math Classroom Challenge there are two types of mathematical panels with hundreds of math combinations: static and dynamic. The static panels propose random exercises, of configurable difficulty, whose numbers have to be searched through the stage, and bathe them with the water of the hose that we carry. Dynamic panels appear anywhere, but can be repositioned, or even invoked manually, and contain three solutions. Irrigate with water the correct solution. Dragons, on the other hand, allow an error to be subtracted, although sometimes they will cause the opposite: they will add up to an error. So the player must decide whether to use them or not. The rocket, when it takes off, multiplies the points…",

You\u0027ll control every move of Leonardo, Michaelangelo, Donatello and Raphael as they arm themselves with head-rattling Nunchakus, back-stabbing Sai Swords, and liver-lashing Katana Blades. Of course, this once in a light year adventure will really start rumbling the nanosecond you bust into 5 never-before-seen levels of Manhattan mayhem, including the Traffic Jam, Waste Dump Ravine and Technodrome Tower. Here you\u0027ll perfect the ancient art of icing, dicing and shuriken-slicing. And you\u0027ll get the chance to wipe the smirks off the faces of all-new creepshow freaks like Roadkill Rodney, Shell Shocker and that nasty villain Filet O\u0027Filth.

Encounters also doesn\u0027t appear to add extra enemies when combat begins.\nCombat is turn-based and characters have a stamina meter, it can get dangerous if not managed as even blocking requires a set amount.
