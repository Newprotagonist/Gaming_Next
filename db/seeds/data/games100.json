Available vehicles and heavy weapons included tippers, sailing boats, hot-air balloons, catapults and crossbows. Portable weapons and building materials included flintstones, incendiary bombs, arrows, concrete and steel bars. Sharks, wipfs, zaps and monsters inhabited the environment, which had a customizable climate including seasons, rain, snow, storms and lightning. Gameplay modes included learning missions, single-player/cooperative and melee/tournament.

You\u0027ll then race across the globe in six locales: Moscow, Scotland, Egypt, Hong Kong, Switzerland and even Easter Island. \n \nIt doesn\u0027t stop there, however. Each track has six increasingly difficult levels that can only be unlocked after placing first on the previous stage. These tracks will offer different times of day, alternate paths, and new obstacles such as boulders to negotiate -- bringing the total number of courses to 36 variants. \n \nOther features include your choice of eight official Car and Driver racing teams, a Season mode where you race for points, and a single-player race against seven computer-controlled vehicles. The game also supports two-player split-screen racing as well as a link-up mode for up to four players on two television sets. In addition, season points, option settings and unlocked courses can all be saved to memory card. The Grand Tour Champion has yet to be decided, are you up to the challenge?",

As soon as the leather dwarves feel unobserved, they cut loose in the most shameless manner. \nThe player\u0027s objective is to keep them from performing their pervert actions with the - mouse controlled - whip in order to obtain a lot of points. One must not get diverted by the dwarves\u0027 animated poses or their insolent comments. This could mean a loss of points or worse. There are different settings like the garden, the greenhouse or the darkroom. \n \nAs a bonus, there are two extra mini games included: \n \n\"Dance the leather dwarf\" - Make the dwarf dance to cool beats. The better your sense of rhythm, the higher the score. \n \n\"Sing Sing! - The dwarves prove their singing talent and you have to repeat the lyrics.",

    "summary": "An action game spin-off in the Total Warrior series. Play as a mighty Spartan trooper, and battle through hordes of enemies in large environments, while working with allies. Use ultra-violent special attacks to mow down entire groups of foes at once, with ridiculously bloody effect. \n \nThe game has a fast-paced, arcade-like, mission-based gameplay. In each mission, you must succeed in minor goals like killing the generals of the opposition, escorting sappers to blow up enemy siege weaponry and preventing the enemy from making to behind your borders. The storyline progresses through cutscenes, shown in-between each mission. \n \nDepending on how you succeed in your mission, you get \"tokens\", which you can use to upgrade the health, damage or power of your character. The player is capable of doing special moves, which can be learned throughout the game. Some of the special moves gain their powers through the spartan gods, that aid the player in his battle. During the game, you can find different weapons like swords, bows and spears, and of course, shields.",

After the player successfully pursues the girl through several levels, he finally runs her down and is presented with a number of CG images, animation or an interactive 3D rape scene. But the ending depends on the choices that the player made in the beginning - there are romantic endings, sadistic endings, or the girl might just run away.

The main computer of the self-sufficient space colony Utopia, called St. Schutz, has gone haywire. The goal of the game is to escape from Utopia. \n \nThe game plays very differently from a normal space shooter. Each \"floor\" is made up of a series of interconnected rooms, and the player can choose any room adjacent to one they\u0027ve cleared. For each adjacent room the player has cleared, their firepower in that room will be greater. Each floor has a number of boss rooms with a much larger and more dangerous enemy, each of which must be cleared to complete the floor. There is also a stronger power weapon which will recharge after use. \n \nAll the while, a strict timer is counting down. When the player gets hit, instead of dying or taking damage, they lose time on the timer. The only way to get more time is to defeat a boss, so the player must balance between clearing rooms for greater firepower, and clearing bosses for more time.",

Pinobee screenshots may lead you to believe that this is a standard action platform game, but that is far from an accurate description.\nPinobee can walk along the ground or shimmy up walls, but his main means of locomotion is dashing through the air. As he makes it deeper in his quest, Pinobee gains the ability to dash farther and farther through the air. Soon enough, he\u0027s spending more time hovering and dashing through the sky than on the ground. This unique play control system gives Pinobee a fresh feel.",

The concept originated from gamer Mike Borland, winner of Doritos-sponsored \"Unlock Xbox\" competition.\n\nThe game is regarded as the easiest game to earn all achievements and Gamerscore points out of all XBLA titles released. According to Giant Bomb, the game\u0027s twelve achievements can all be easily earned in under 20 minutes. The game references this several times in dialogue with the player, such as telling players to \"get their Gamerscore on\" and to \"go on a Gamerscore rampage\". This game is no longer available on the Xbox Live Marketplace, but can be re-downloaded if it was previously downloaded before it was taken off the Xbox Live Marketplace.",

The game features two campaigns based around the events in southern Russia between summer 1942 and early 1943. The game has two playable modes, first one is by default the RKKA (Workers\u0027 and Peasants\u0027 Red Army) campaign which follows the Red Army\u0027s progress as it liberated Stalingrad and destroyed the 6th Army. And the second mode is the Wehrmacht campaign, which has the player commanding the 6th Army as it approached the city and the battles for the city itself. The game maps themselves are reproduced from historical tactical maps and actual aerial photography taken during the period that the campaign covers.",

The game was developed by MercurySteam and published by Konami. This is MercurySteam\u0027s last contribution to the franchise. The story is set in both medieval and modern worlds.\n\nAs in the previous game, the player controls Gabriel Belmont, now known as Dracula, as he fights through an open world. During the game\u0027s opening sequence the player is able to control Dracula while he still possesses all his powers as well as all of his weapons. Dracula\u0027s main weapon is his Blood Whip, a weapon that is comparable to the Combat Cross from the original Lords of Shadow. Replacing the magic system from the previous game are the Void Sword and the Chaos Claws. The Void Sword can replenish Dracula\u0027s health when used while the Chaos Claws can be used to break through enemy defenses and deliver powerful attacks. The story mode in Lords of Shadow 2 has been stated to be far longer than the previous one. The game is mainly an open world allowing the player to choose what route to take. This game also features a movable camera, something that was not available in the first Lords of Shadow game.",

In the main campaign\u0027s story-driven missions, you begin play as Jim Hawkins, a cadet in the Royal Navy\u0027s fight against pirates and the deadly Procyon Fleet, with an eye toward eventual promotion to fleet commander. Skirmish and multiplayer modes allow the choice of playing as all three factions. \n \nSuccessfully completed missions result in ship and fleet enhancements, more experienced crews, and upgraded weapons. Royal Navy Fleet weapons are only slightly inferior to the reworked weapons of the Procyon Fleet but are sturdier and less vulnerable. Ships for the Royal Navy range from torpedo boats and war sloops to escorts, frigates, and the impressive StarHammer, while pirates man sloops, gunboats, schooners, assault cutters, and more, including several unique designs like the carrack and barque. The Procyon Fleet is built for speed and maneuverability, geared for fast hit-and-run attacks, and as the game progresses, news of a mysterious Ironclad Fleet surfaces as well. \n \nShip designs in Battle at Procyon are fashioned after the seafaring ships from the golden age of sail, with solar winds filling the sails and rigging. Arsenals reflect futuristic models of light, medium, and heavy weapons such as laserball and plasma cannons, beam weapons, Gatling guns, harpoons, fire and net launchers, gravity waves, torpedoes, mortars, and more. Other features include multiple waypoint settings, star maps, panic fire, secondary ship control, docking, repairing, towing, grappling, and boarding actions.",

They don\u0027t anticipate much of a struggle - Mungolans are simple, earthy types without much love for industry. In fact, Mungola\u0027s entire defence force consists of a single squadron of fighter planes - the venerable F-27 \"Platypus\". \n \nWhat possible threat could a few antique aircraft be to the mighty Collosotropolan Battle Fleet...? \n \nTo the Mungolan people the venerable F-27 \"Platypus\" is their last best hope for freedom!",

You can have this kind of excitement with ZEBCO FISHING! for the Game Boy Color. Hit one of two lakes with a choice of 11 different fishing lures. Try to catch the biggest bass possible in the Tournament mode, and for an extra challenge, try to catch exactly 21 pounds of bass in the Blackjack Bass mode. In both modes, catching fish other than bass has no effect on the outcome. Try to become a fishing champion with ZEBCO FISHING!",

Working closely with Williams to ensure authenticity of each of the games, the collection is highlighted by some of the most popular and innovative Williams pinball tables, including Gorgar, the first-ever talking pinball machine, Black Knight, which introduced \"Magna-Save\" and Bonus Ball, and Space Shuttle, which took the pinball industry by storm in 1984. Every table has been meticulously recreated to bring players the visuals, sound effects and gameplay that made these games legendary successes. Pinball Hall of Fame: The Williams Collection harkens back to the arcades of the 1980s. Players begin Pinball Hall of Fame: The Williams Collection with access to four pinball tables, and the remaining four tables are unlocked as the game progresses. Players can spend as little as two minutes on a quick pinball challenge, or delve deeper into the game, gaining rewards in a token-based system as they unlock each of the pinball tables. Single-player Arcade and Challenge modes provide hours of solo entertainment, and a Multiplayer mode lets players face each other head-on.",

While it still uses the Active Time Battle system, it deviates from the series\u0027 traditional means of boosting a character\u0027s power via leveling, although levels are not completely abandoned as they were in FINAL FANTASY II. In addition, it does not have a Magic Point-based system for spell-casting. Instead, magic is collected, drawn, and created from items, and is used to power up the characters via the junction system.",

Screencheat: Unplugged features a myriad of improvements over the original release, as well as alterations tailored just for the Nintendo Switch™, including: a graphical overhaul with more vibrant and clear visuals designed with the portable screen in mind, new and remixed maps, remastered weapons, an updated UI, full support for single Joy-Con™, dual Joy-Con™, and Nintendo Switch Pro Controller inputs, and an entirely new soundtrack introducing a fresh and mischievous medley of energetic tracks to enjoy. Remember when looking at your friends’ screen in Goldeneye was frowned upon? Well those days are gone and in Screencheat, we encourage it! Screencheat is a chaotic split-screen multiplayer shooter that forces players to rethink the way they approach conventional multiplayer games. In the Screencheat arena, fast reaction times aren’t enough to keep you alive. When everyone is invisible, players will have to master the art of taking a not-so sneaky look at their opponent’s screens and working out where they are based on uniquely coloured areas of the map and distinctive landmarks. Screencheat pays homage to iconic competitive first-person shooters such as Goldeneye, Perfect Dark and Halo, by blending the elements everyone loves about those games and shaking it up with its own unique take on the genre. When everyone’s used to playing by the rules, can you adapt to unconventional gaming quick enough to get the upper hand?",

    "summary": "Yazzie is a homebrew platform game with some puzzle elements. It was originally created as a ZX Spectrum title for the Yandex Retro Games Battle 2019 where it took third place. Later it was ported to other platforms. It consists of several levels, mostly a single screen with slight scrolling near the edges, where a gold digger needs to collect all the gold bars in the environment to complete the level. As soon as all gold is collected the level ends right away.\n\nEach level represents a room in a mansion, with several platforms, ladders and hazards such as fire. There are enemies moving over the platforms and they are able to use ladders. There are free-roaming flying creatures as well. A single encounter with an enemy or a hazard is immediately deadly and makes the level restart. There are no ways to attack the enemies, they can only be avoided.\n\nA lot of the gameplay revolves around luring the enemies away in a certain direction so you can pass and grab the gold on the other side. There are platforms where it is possible to drop down through them right away. Certain pieces of gold can only be reached through digging. Pickaxes can be picked up in certain levels and they allow the character to dig down once per axe. Other game elements are bridges that can be activated and timed explosions that can be triggered to clear a part of then environment. After a certain number of levels a password is provided.",

It was released in Japan on September 15, 2005, in Europe on October 21, 2005 distributed by Atari Europe, and in North America on October 26, 2005, but under the same name as the original PS2 game causing confusion and misinterpreting as a port. \n \nGhost in the Shell features first-person shooter gameplay. Customizable Tachikoma sentient tanks, which can operate independently as AI characters or be ridden inside by players, accompany the player at all times. Playable characters include Motoko Kusanagi, Batou, Togusa, and Saito. All levels can be played by all characters. Aramaki is also available for multiplayer matches. All characters have varying statistics which can affect how a game plays out, for example Batou has more health than other players and Saito holds sniper rifles steadier than others. In addition, Tachikoma robots can act as an AI companion, and players can select from four Tachikoma \"characters\", balanced, aggressive, intelligent and humorous. Controls are similar to other first person shooter games on the platform, such as Coded Arms and Medal of Honor: Heroes.",

In the present time late at night, Inky, Pinky, Blinky and Clyde sneak into the village and, in their mischief, pick the Golden Fruit off the tree in the center of town.

    "summary": "Welcome to The Abbattoir Intergrade. The year is 2238, and you are assuming the role of Shepherd Cartalia of the colony X1407, a human colony on the habitable planet B382 founded in 2148. Earth is 20 light years away and has largely been abandoned after the climate became erratic, quickly alternating between extreme high and low temperatures.  \n \nAt the start of your expedition your colony was outfitted with the latest terraforming package provided by the Human Federation. This package includes an AI module that modifies livestock DNA to generate edible lifeforms that area ideal to the planet conditions allowing you to focus efforts on terraforming and construction. Your settlement progress has been spectacular, and although you\u0027re nearing retirement, you\u0027ve managed to expand the colony from its meager initial size of 100 adult citizens in a valley, to over 1,000 residents of all ages spread over several outposts during your tenure. \n \nUnfortunately, the \u0027Sustenance and Nutrient Generator\u0027 you were given seems to be malfunctioning, as the animals being created have recently exhibited violent behaviour and are now chasing down your people as they flee to the founding settlement. You need to set up defenses to slow the tide of violent animals, while you begin a search for a lasting solution. \n \nThis game is a unique fusion of tower defense strategy and visual novel, with branching dialogue and four different endings. As you play, the AI uses machine learning to discover what offense is the best against specific defenses. It takes into account the pathing, water hazards, and even the genetics of the animals which it controls indirectly by selecting the best specimens from its own evolving evaluation.",
