Not clearing enough within a set time limit will force the blocks to the top of the screen, where the player will lose. Blocks can be cleared if at least four blocks of the same color are touching. The speed of new rows will increase as the game is played longer. The blocks which get cleared will result in the blocks above falling down. The game offers several different modes including a multiplayer and arcade mode.",

In this ravaged world, the planet\u0027s dwindling resources have divided what remains of mankind in two: the urban freedom fighting \u0027Remnants\u0027 and the technologically advanced \u0027Ascension\u0027. Now they must wage war against a new threat, the invasion of a savage alien race, the Hai-Genti, and each other in a desperate struggle for supremacy and survival. Through the game\u0027s missions, take command from different viewpoints and employ faction-specific tactics and weaponry to achieve your objectives. Complete with the ability to terraform landscapes and transform units, Maelstrom provides gamers with the power to harness the forces of nature in the most frantic, destructive, action-packed RTS game yet.   \n\t\t\t\t\tA stunning mix of action-packed RTS missions set in a totally destructible and immaculately realised environment.   \n\t\t\t\t\tA devastated future Earth becomes the battleground as a divided human race fights for survival against alien invaders.   \n\t\t\t\t\tThrough the game, players control each of the game\u0027s three factions - the Remnants, Ascension and the alien Hai-Genti - each with unique identities, strengths and tactics.   \n\t\t\t\t\tModify the terrain and use the elements as a strategic weapon.

The fun never stops as you grow grass, feed chickens, collect eggs and take your produce to market. From there, you\u0027ll spend the money you earn on additional buildings that produce exciting new products, including delicious steaks, tasty cakes and quaint down-home apparel. \n \nYou\u0027ve got to stay on your sun-kissed toes, though, to keep the bears from tearing up your farm. Thankfully, dogs are on hand to help drive them away! With tons of levels to complete, plenty of hidden gags to find, and an empty shelf begging to be filled with trophies for outstanding achievements, Farm Frenzy 2 will keep you busy throughout the dog days of summer and long after the harvest.",

A forward spin will launch him forward, and a backspin will launch him straight upward. This greatly aids in exploration of each stage, allowing for very long or high jumps. There are also a number of power-ups to be found, including Ice Potato and Rocket Potato.\n\nThe game is made up of a number of zones, each with six stages. At the end of each zone, Potato must face off against a food-themed boss enemy, such as a stack of plates or a giant ice cream cone.",

It was developed by Omega Integral Systems, released by Safari Software, and distributed by Epic MegaGames (now Epic Games).\n\nThe game uses a top-down view. The player\u0027s car is situated on a raised highway. The ground is visible on the sides. The player\u0027s car is constantly moving upwards through the level, though the player can maneuver his car around the screen within the boundaries of the highway. The player fires at enemies that come from the top of the screen. There are ground enemies on the highway and flying enemies that can come in from the sides or the top. Some enemies may drop weapon power ups which make the player car\u0027s projectiles stronger or more numerous. The game is divided into three episodes each with a number of levels, with a boss at the end of each level. The shareware version omits the second and third episodes. The highway environments start out looking earthly, but the player moves into more alien levels later in the game.",

Two of these creatures, humans and demons, have been struggling against each other for many years. As the centuries passed, control shifted from demons to humans and back again. The humans finally earned a clear victory after the First Neverland War. But this left the country in ruins and led directly to the Second Neverland War, which saw the decisive victory of the demons once again. \nMagic Age 1053— \nTragedy strikes the small woodland village of Petun—the town is attacked and burned to the ground by vicious Neverland troops. But Petun is only the first of many massacres; the Demon Army tears through every human village it can find, slaughtering the people as it goes. Humiliated and infuriated by these abuses, the humans begin to resist and fight back. \nIt starts as a rash of disorganized, sporadic riots. But it soon grows into something more, something meaningful. These uprisings become a beacon of hope to all humans, spurring them on to unite and form a new empire. They choose a name to reflect their most noble traditions, to reflect a time when they ruled over the demon horde. They call it the Reformed Simba Empire. \nPetun—little more than a bump in the road, a mark on a map. But this is where it all started, where the undercurrent of disdain and hatred overflowed into a bloody torrent of death and destruction, drowning Neverland in war for years to come. \nThis is where our story begins—the story of the Seven Year War.",

Vacation introduces new items, characters, and features, as well as a new destination called Vacation Island where Sims can take vacations with family members or with other Sims. This marks the first time Sims can stay on lots away from home, meaning the game can be saved while a Sim is on Vacation Island. Vacation Island is split into three distinct environments: beach, forest, and snow-capped mountain. Sims can purchase or find souvenirs and either stay at a hotel or rent a tent/igloo.",

The prophecy also mentions a great and mighty warrior who would restore the Moon Juju, defeat Tlaloc, and bring peace to the Pupanunu people. \n \nHaving escaped Tlaloc\u0027s spell, Jibolba believes his apprentice Lok to be the warrior of the prophecy and prepares to send him off; however, it appears that Lok has been turned into a sheep. Jibolba sends his younger apprentice, Tak (voiced by Jason Marsden), to find magical plants and change him back, though it turns out not to be Lok. Jibolba tells Tak to obtain the Spirit Rattle, which allows the wielder to communicate with powerful Juju spirits to assist him, while he finds Lok. \n \nTak returns with the Rattle to find that Lok has been trampled to death by a herd of sheep. Jibolba has Tak collect 100 magic Yorbels and Lok\u0027s spirit from the spirit world, allowing him to successfully resurrect Lok. An unfortunate side-effect of the resurrection, however, is a severe case of diarrhea. Tak obtains the Moon Stones instead while Lok recovers, restoring the Moon Juju to full strength. \n \nThe Moon Juju reveals that the warrior of the prophecy is not Lok, but Tak, as he has already fulfilled almost everything the prophecy predicted. Using his arsenal of Juju spells, Tak defeats Tlaloc and turns him into a sheep, finally fulfilling the prophecy.",

It was developed by Game Arts in cooperation with Mirage Studios and released by Ubisoft in celebration of the 25th anniversary of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles in 2009.\n\nThe game is a 4-player 2.5D fighting game, similar to the Super Smash Bros. series. During battle, players attempt to KO opponents by depleting their life bar, knocking them off the stage or into traps.Characters are color-coded on-screen via a glow effect to help players keep track of their character (a feature that can be toggled on and off in the options screen). Like Super Smash Bros., the game features many customizable options for battles.The game stresses interaction with the environment, and stages in the game feature traps, changes to the stage itself and interactive elements. The gameplay system also features items, including life-restoring pizza and ninja skills that grant players special abilities like fire breathing and electrical shields. The modes for this game are Arcade, Battle Royal, Survival, Tournament, Swap-Out, Practice, and Mission Mode, as well as an online mode for four players and mini-games. Players can collect \u0027shells\u0027 during battles or mini-games and use them to unlock special features, including trophies that other players can win in online tournaments. Arcade mode features animated cut scenes illustrated by Mirage Studios artists.",

Do this all spontaneously, and at any point you can save and continue later.\n\nBuilt from the ground up for Virtual Reality - optional\n\nDerail Valley fully supports playing on a regular PC, using mouse and keyboard on a flat screen, but virtual reality is where it really shines. In VR you can, for the first time ever, truly be inside train cabs and operate controls with your own hands. Derail Valley supports all major PC VR headsets, such as Oculus, Windows Mixed Reality, Valve and HTC.",

The Shinsengumi was formed to combat this rising tide of violence, and to protect the shogun and the people from dangerous ronin. \nAs the country inches close to all-out war, Chizuru travels to Kyoto to find her missing father. She encounters both danger and the Shinsengumi, in quick succession. After learning that the Shinsengumi are also looking for her father, Chizuru goes under their protection. However, they soon find themselves in the midst of political intrigue, supernatural power struggles, and much more as they search desperately for the answer they need.",

The game takes place in various locations, such as tropical forests, canyons, volcanic areas, snowy tundras and other harsh environments. There are also a number of dimensional stages, in the Dreamworld. Tak gets aid from animals, a number of which did not appear in the first game. In this game, Tak\u0027s juju magic is triggered by holding down one button and pressing combos of other buttons. Tak also earns juju powers gradually throughout the game instead of having to seek them out.",

Keeping in line with the \"world of dreams\" theme – it wouldn\u0027t be Nights without it – players will take control of Will and Helen, two young children each entering into Nightopia (the world of dreams) with their own back-story, emotional baggage, and inner demons that come to life though the forming of nightmares. It\u0027s a pretty simple concept overall, and with each child\u0027s five main levels you\u0027ll get a different piece of the story leading up to the same grand finale. Once they arrive in the land of dreams, each character meets up with a Nights almost instantaneously, and from there learns to meld with the mysterious creature and fly through the world of Nightopia. Along the way you\u0027ll learn of the quest to find the hidden Ideya (basically essences of the human spirit), and eventually attempt to defeat a powerful god-like creature named Wizeman and his right-hand man Reala.",

    "summary": "In the award winning game ItzaBitza , drawings truly come to life.   Kids help their Sketchy by using Living Ink - a unique drawing recognition system – to draw one-of-a kind interactive objects that form the centerpiece of the game\u0027s action.   Draw a house and watch the character shrink to fit in the door; draw flames and watch the rocket ship they drew blast off.   \n \nThe game provides a totally unique experience every time it is played. Since the environment is created through each player\u0027s personal drawings, the possibilities are as endless and fantastic as the player’s imagination.  The game comes with five themed playsets – \"Home Sweet Home\", \"Let’s go Camping\", \"Play in Space\", \"A Farm Life\", and perfect for Halloween – \"A VERY Scary Haunted House.\"  Players unlock playsets by winning star challenges. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tItzaBitza is more than just a fun game.  The game has been crafted specifically for early-readers.  In ItzaBitza, players who are just learning to read start out having a blast watching the whimsical reactions happen between their drawings and their Sketchy.  Then all of a sudden, they need to read to win a star.  Or to know what to draw so they can help their Sketchy.   Parents will be delighted by the game\u0027s ability to enhance their child\u0027s self-confidence. Unlike some games that leave younger players frustrated by their difficulty and lack of assistance, ItzaBitza provides features to guide children even when faced with unfamiliar concepts. If an early-reader encounters a new word, it can be read aloud to them with the simple act of hovering the mouse over the word.  \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThrough a delightful twist on drawing games, ItzaBitza introduces a new way for kids to game and while they are playing, really important learning is happening.  New methods to engage children, discovered during a multi-year research project conducted by Microsoft Corporation, are fused into the game\u0027s design, yielding a unique experience that encourages fun and learning.",
