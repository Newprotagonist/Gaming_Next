Similarly to Pokemon Reborn, Pokemon Rejuvenation is not a ROM Hack, but rather an RPG Maker game.\n\nThe game takes place in the Aevium region, which was split into several islands after some catastrophic event in the past. The protagonist and his/her/their mother, Nancy, are in the process of arriving there on the S.S. Oceana when it gets attacked by the local villainous team, Team Xen. Despite the ship being destroyed and the protagonist's mother being captured, the protagonist manages to escape thanks to the fire-type Elite 8 member, Tesla. With her help, they arrive in Eastern Gearen City on the mainland of Aevium, ready to battle the Pokemon League, defeat Team Xen, and hopefully rescue their mother in the process.\n\nLike its inspiration, Pokemon Reborn, Pokemon Rejuvenation has a story that's more mature than the main Pokemon games, albeit not as dark as Pokemon Reborn's story (for the most part, anyway). It's also very, very difficult, arguably even more so than its inspiraton. The game borrows Pokemon Reborn's ideas of a field effect system, 18 Gym Leaders, and a level cap, but also adds an Elite 8 instead of the traditional Elite 4, as well as new, unique moves for every gym leader. In addition, the game brings back Shadow Pokemon from Pokémon Colosseum and Pokémon XD (although they get a Nerf, with their attacks being not very effective against Fairy-type Pokemon).\n\nThe game, and the supplementary spin-off game Where Love Lies, can be downloaded on its own official subforum of the Pokémon Reborn forums here or here.","tags":[17,40,268435468,268435472,268435487,536872059,536872916,536874296,536895036,536898128]},{"id":84822,"cover":{"id":212870,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co4k92.jpg"},"name":"PINK DOT BLUE DOT","platforms":[{"id":37,"name":"Nintendo 3DS"}],"screenshots":[{"id":440136,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc9fm0.jpg"},{"id":440138,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc9fm2.jpg"},{"id":440140,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc9fm4.jpg"}],"summary":"Tap the screen in this variation of the classic game while keeping the colors in sync.

One of its highlights is the use of Euphoria, a game animation engine that determines animations dynamically rather than depending on canned animations. Backbreaker does not use teams from the National Football League (NFL) because Electronic Arts has an exclusive license to produce NFL games in its Madden series. The game relies on an extensive logo editor and team builder that was called \"one of its silver linings\". NaturalMotion announced Backbreaker in August 2007, with a targeted release date of late 2008. The game ended up being delayed until mid-2010.\n\nBackbreaker received mixed reviews. While it was praised for the Euphoria animation system, realistic physical gameplay, and the logo editor, it was also criticized for its weak online play, poor passing game, and lack of depth in single-player modes. After the reviews, the passing game was adjusted by the greathouse patch. The Xbox 360 version of the game received an overall rating of 54% from review aggregator Metacritic, while the PlayStation 3 version received a 58%. The iOS and Android version was given a rating of 4.5 out of 5 stars by Touch Arcade. A patch released on 6 August 2010, alleviated many of the issues critics had with the game upon release and included upgrades such as: improved AI, new play books and an enhanced replay feature.[1]","tags":[268435470,536870938,536870939,536870944,536872078,536872205,536875046,536875157,536875184,536875185,536875271,536875437,536875464,536875887,536876695,536876719,536878091,536878092,536878093,536881831,536882545]},{"id":134896,"cover":{"id":212776,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co4k6g.jpg"},"name":"Surprise Mechanic: The Gaming Trivia","platforms":[{"id":6,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"},{"id":34,"name":"Android"}],"summary":"Welcome to Surprise Mechanic, the trivia game focused in the gaming industry.

Whereas Rule the Waves ended by 1925, Rule The Waves II covers the entire time period from 1900 to 1955, including aricraft and aircraft carriers. Ownership of Rule the Waves is not required to be able to play Rule the Waves II. Rule the Waves II places you in the role of 'Grand Admiral' of a navy during the first half of the 20th Century. The game is centered on designing ships and fighting naval battles, but politics, economic and foreign policy decisions will be necessary as the Player guides their navy's deployment, construction and operations during a period of great technological innovation and political tensions. Rule the Waves is modeled on the period up to the end of the second world war, but is not intended to precisely recreate history. Rather RTW2 gives the Player the tools to lead a navy during the era when 'steam and iron' dominated the high seas.","tags":[22,268435467,268435471,536871906,536872383,536874694,536875067]},{"id":8869,"aggregated_rating":88.5,"cover":{"id":128788,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co2rdg.jpg"},"name":"Spacecom","platforms":[{"id":3,"name":"Linux"},{"id":6,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"},{"id":14,"name":"Mac"},{"id":39,"name":"iOS"}],"screenshots":[{"id":98815,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/lkaceei22bzbcukbpzyy.jpg"},{"id":98816,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/xhtvckokvdlrz1bdtdjb.jpg"},{"id":98817,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/ywh7ptl83xtmpi4bz2tl.jpg"},{"id":98818,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/cfn7ctszt8oals1wf58g.jpg"},{"id":98819,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/nsgt3yyx1yqyny8ummwb.jpg"}],"summary":"A strategic-to-the-bone, star fleet command game in which deception, smart movement, and choices to battle decide victory or defeat.","tags":[18,268435467,268435471,268435488,536871882,536874694,536875521,536876228,536876239],"videos":[{"id":4016,"video_id":"qAMQhZB1TB0"}]},{"id":19175,"cover":{"id":103551,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co27wf.jpg"},"name":"Rocket Fist","platforms":[{"id":3,"name":"Linux"},{"id":6,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"},{"id":14,"name":"Mac"},{"id":41,"name":"Wii U"},{"id":48,"name":"PlayStation 4"},{"id":49,"name":"Xbox One"},{"id":130,"name":"Nintendo Switch"}],"screenshots":[{"id":23629,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/voiqfrnkc0edjbnll7gz.jpg"},{"id":23630,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/pir7ezoxgi73mv1vdos7.jpg"},{"id":23631,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/f8dhwiq6gahaz1galaxi.jpg"},{"id":23632,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/g4onz52tctiadzxxdboo.jpg"},{"id":23633,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/de6sbr5umocofg03tm6r.jpg"},{"id":181759,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/xridqr9biyczvulqw2wq.jpg"},{"id":181760,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/u5k0bsw4xy0y1rrvv6kv.jpg"},{"id":181761,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/xceqltp3j4v9jcshmlmb.jpg"},{"id":181762,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/o6wekopuy1vm9c2we8ux.jpg"},{"id":181763,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/seuz8abvlxhimlfpy0uj.jpg"},{"id":181764,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/eytqkbrfhz5mzgggnbzr.jpg"}],"summary":"Rocket Fist is an arena game with crazy robots in chaotic rocket fist battles.

Another new feature is the Senzai Ninriki (translated in Clash of Ninja Revolution 3 as Latent Ninja Powers), where every character glows a certain colour when they hit low health/crisis mode. Similar to gaining new specials in crisis mode as of the first Revolution game and beforehand Naruto: Gekitō Ninja Taisen! 3, the Senzai Ninriki is a special crisis mode that provides certain effects depending on the character, for example Naruto and Temari's backward strong attacks no longer use up chakra, Hinata can chakra cancel her attacks with no chakra cost, Kakashi deals damage through guard with all his attacks, Neji and Gaara automatically deflect projectiles while standing still, certain characters' moves become unblockable and so on. Most of the characters' Senzai Ninriki effects change in Naruto Shippūden: Clash of Ninja Revolution 3 onwards.\nOne of the game's new modes is the \"Hurricane Clash Mode\", which is also reworked into the new story mode which is original from the main storyline. In this mode, the player controls their character in a full 3D movement perspective and can take on hordes of ninja in a beat em' up genre fashion, with many character movesets retweaked solely for this mode.

It is the third game in the Valkyria Chronicles series and was released on January 27, 2011 exclusively in Japan. An expanded version of the game, subtitled Extra Edition was released in Japan on November 23, 2011. The game features an opening song Moshimo Kimi ga Negau no nara sung by Japanese singer May'n.\n\nOccurring in the same time frame as the first game, Valkyria Chronicles III is a side story that follows the exploits of an unwanted and castigated Gallian Army squad during the Imperial invasion of 1935.[3] Contrasting the previous games' bright outlook and recognition for their protagonists, Valkyria Chronicles III explores the themes of being outcast and the search for redemption. As described by its catchphrase, the game tells \"The tale of nameless soldiers who, on the verge of despair, changed history.\"\n\nThe game was the first in the series to not officially be translated into English by Sega. However, an unofficial fan translation for the Extra Edition was eventually released in December 2013.\n\nIncluded VC3 DLCs:\n- Kurt Irving's First Mission\n- No.1 is Restless\n- Penalty Mission - The Barricaded Harbour\n- The Secret of Her Powers","tags":[1,22,31,39,268435468,268435471,268435472,268435480,268435487,536870990,536871384,536871433,536872509,536873551,536873587,536874038,536889728,536896177,536896767,536896857,536897014],"videos":[{"id":40494,"video_id":"aY2ttI3Qscg"}]},{"id":61296,"cover":{"id":124080,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co2nqo.jpg"},"name":"Mogeko Castle","platforms":[{"id":6,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}],"screenshots":[{"id":320239,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc6v3j.jpg"},{"id":320240,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc6v3k.jpg"},{"id":320241,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc6v3l.jpg"}],"summary":"Mogeko Castle is a \"prosciutto adventure game\" made by Deep-Sea Prisoner in RPG Maker VX Ace.","tags":[19,268435487,268435488,536871939,536872032,536872220,536872255,536875940]},{"id":24644,"cover":{"id":188380,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co41cs.jpg"},"name":"God of Word","platforms":[{"id":6,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"},{"id":14,"name":"Mac"}],"screenshots":[{"id":32382,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/roh74wmagdyetkzsi6vn.jpg"},{"id":32383,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/cmopu6npvrvzs811u0xg.jpg"},{"id":32384,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/uxgjmoz00la80fdwnoqk.jpg"},{"id":32385,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/wx8yfrklamvf1izgzjll.jpg"},{"id":32386,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/rnoycdg2u3dboq6x3xtm.jpg"}],"summary":"God of Word is an exciting twist on classic word & typing games, fusing together multiple game modes with the enchanting setting of Greek Mythology to create the ultimate word game.","tags":[1,268435465,268435468,268435488,536870947,536871208,536871631,536873787]},{"id":97193,"name":"Realistic Illusion","platforms":[{"id":6,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}],"screenshots":[{"id":231093,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/bwhwdzef61lj8lrw3dns.jpg"},{"id":231094,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/afkfiqkjz5gdkddhowfl.jpg"},{"id":231095,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/zcohkk0xucquzccjz8xy.jpg"},{"id":231096,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/nyeuih3hmgw4t0yzxtvo.jpg"},{"id":231097,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/xtkzq9ifboiqjf8cpcac.jpg"},{"id":231098,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/smd94vblwtaxiw9nbqle.jpg"},{"id":231099,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/fkxarpc7d0orcrmssxoo.jpg"},{"id":231100,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/luxgjhmo6kgj1he1xuao.jpg"},{"id":231101,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/mvqb5loevetjun1taf6n.jpg"},{"id":231102,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/g47x6m0hib2mmmpccclk.jpg"},{"id":231103,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/ffr82zw0qcmx58kdsvd3.jpg"},{"id":231104,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/ewzmghdgdcr10nazcp5l.jpg"}],"summary":"Realistic Illusion is the first person player adventure game with stylized graphics.

The gameplay is identical: a fast-paced, top-down soccer game with emphasis on fast passes and simple control system.\n\nPlayers can choose between 40 national, 64 club or 64 custom (fantasy) teams and can assemble their own tournaments (cup or league) with them. The number of participating teams and some of the rules can be customized. The main difference to the original is the reduced number of pre-set tournaments: for national teams World cup qualifiers and the new Maastricht Cup (a knockout tournament) and for club teams the European Superleague and EUFA Cup. Custom teams only have the Booby League and Turkey Tournament available anymore. Another important difference is that the athletes and tournaments no longer use original names, e.g. EUFA instead of UEFA.\n\nThe SEGA CD version uses its increased storage capacity for additional sound and some rendered movies, e.g. a flight over a stadium before starting a match.\n\nLike the computer version, the only major change compared to the predecessor are the additional eleven national teams and updated team rosters. It also features the World Cup 1994 as pre-set tournament (with the original groups) instead of World Cup qualifiers. Otherwise it keeps the same pre-set tournament options and the option to create own tournaments (cup or league) with the 51 national, 64 club and 64 custom (fantasy) teams.\n\nThe Genesis version features original names which are slightly changed in the European SNES version (e.g. Klonsmann instead of Klinsmann). In the US version, the names have no resemblance to original athletes.","tags":[32,268435470,536870938,536870939,536871425,536871951,536883032,536898318,536901157,536901158,536901159,536901160],"videos":[{"id":53938,"video_id":"Hggy4bOqaHc"},{"id":53939,"video_id":"AYCRfK7KMYo"},{"id":53940,"video_id":"P053rdzt9kQ"}]},{"id":122709,"cover":{"id":173415,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co3pt3.jpg"},"name":"Eidolon","platforms":[{"id":6,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}],"screenshots":[{"id":334586,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc7662.jpg"}],"summary":"Welcome to Eidolon University!

Tightwad, whom the circus owes $10,000, arrives on the scene with the intent of demolishing the circus unless it can pay up. He plans to build a set of luxury hotels on the terrain. In a fit of desperation, the ringmaster organises a display of six events to raise money for the doomed circus: diving, juggling, trapeze, knife throwing, tightrope and the human cannonball. The performance in each event is judged by five clown judges, who offer money depending on the quality of the show. The businessman has no intention of letting the circus raise the cash though, and he sends his lackey, the evil Fiendish Freddy, to sabotage the acts. \nEach player is represented by a circus animal (tiger, lion, bear, etc.) \n \nThe game was similar to many of the multi-event sports games of the time such as Epyx' California Games, Winter Games and Summer Games. However, Fiendish Freddy differed not only by its surroundings (circus events) offering a comedy element, it also offered a plot and a clear goal of winning $10,000. The six events were thus: \n \nDiving \nThe player is challenged to jump off four diving boards of increasing height into containers of water of decreasing size, beginning with a huge wooden container, and ending in a glass of water. (The third target, however, is a cement block, a possible homage to the Looney Tunes cartoon Big Top Bunny, amongst other things.) Money is earned by completing all four levels, as well as performing a set series of stunts. Freddy attempts to hinder the player by blowing the diver off course with an enormous hair dryer; he appears if the diver fails to complete the stunt in time. \n \nJuggling \nThe player must make their way through four juggling sessions of increasing difficulty. Each level brings more balls to juggle, but not just balls - sometimes babies get lost in the mass and must be thrown back into their prams. Of course, Freddy throws a surprise or two into the mix, in the form of bombs, which can be thrown back at Freddy to consequently explode in his face, or missiles which must be juggled as per other objects. Dropping bombs or missiles will cause them to explode and kill the juggler. \nThe juggler is allowed five mistakes (marked by dots changing from green to red) before the game is over. Missing five times without dying from a bomb or missile leads an off-stage performer to use a cane to grab the juggler and yank him off screen. \n \nTrapeze \nThe aim of this section is to proceed from right to left over three levels, jumping from rope to rope. Along the way there are rings of fire and moving targets which have to be mastered. Freddy, as usual, is omnipresent with a jet pack and large pair of scissors to cut your act short if you are too slow. \nSights on the ground, ranging from a marching band and organ to a trainer with his elephant, are also present as a possible distraction, although it can also be argued that the former are providing the music for the act. \n \nKnife throwing \nThe player must throw knives at balloons on a rotating wheel with a female assistant strapped to it. The assistant is not a target, and will scream if hit, as well as the screen getting covered in blood. There are a limited number of knives available. If the player does not manage to burst all of the balloons before the time or knives run out, it's over. Freddy contributes to the challenge once in a while by throwing smoke grenades in to hinder the player's vision. \n \nTightrope \nThe player must walk across three tightropes armed only with a pole to keep balance. Freddy intervenes occasionally with his jet pack, attempting to knock the player off the rope, or with razor blades to cut the player in half. The blades can be deflected with the pole. \n \nHuman Cannonball \nThe final event involves an attempt by the player to launch him or herself into a target from a cannon. The amount of gunpowder in the cannon is predetermined, and the player has to judge the angle necessary to launch the character into the target. Freddy plays a smaller role in this subgame - he only gets involved if the player takes too long to decide upon the angle, upon which he destroys the cannon. \n \nEndings \nThere are two endings to the game. \nIf the player collected enough money to save the circus, the performers get their revenge on Freddy by launching a portly diva with a seesaw, crushing Freddy. \nIf the player failed to get enough money, the circus is demolished and a building labeled as Freddy Towers is erected in its place.","tags":[1,32,268435470,268435489,536871186,536872790,536873076,536875179,536875240,536875262,536876803,536877308]},{"id":29715,"cover":{"id":96489,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co22g9.jpg"},"name":"1166","platforms":[{"id":3,"name":"Linux"},{"id":6,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"},{"id":14,"name":"Mac"}],"screenshots":[{"id":68430,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/g6wzvqbtoie2qkef8mm8.jpg"},{"id":68431,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/zz8rdgbgwpo99srygntw.jpg"},{"id":68432,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/vxbmq3zr3ya48ocom7o1.jpg"},{"id":68433,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/ekv7anqkhf5dyhrtgxd2.jpg"},{"id":68434,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/ayq9y9yvwggh4chmop40.jpg"}],"summary":"1166 is a psychological horror game following six people in Salem, Massachusetts and how their lives change when one of them is kidnapped.","tags":[1,268435487,268435488]},{"id":152749,"cover":{"id":153560,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co3ahk.jpg"},"name":"Zelda 1 / Metroid 1 Combo Randomizer","platforms":[{"id":18,"name":"Nintendo Entertainment System (NES)"}],"summary":"This is a combination randomizer for the original NES Legend of Zelda and Metroid games.\n\nThe randomizer combines the two classics into a unified gaming experience, which allows gameplay to seamlessly switch from one game to the other via special portals added to each game.

The individual characters do not have an attack change when focused, with the exception of Remilia.\n\nQuite a few smaller details are unique to this game, including Last Spells - for an enemy, a Last Spell is a bonus Spell Card which the player can tackle without fear of losing lives/bombs. On the player side, Last Spells are secondary \"bomb\" Spell Cards, which last longer/do much more damage at the expense of two bomb stocks. There is a gauge which tracks how human/youkai (normal/focused) you are, as well as a new \"Time\" system, which affects gameplay.","tags":[17,268435489],"videos":[{"id":8018,"video_id":"tLXvt-a6hXE"}]},{"id":7677,"aggregated_rating":45.0,"cover":{"id":198557,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co497h.jpg"},"name":"Doorways: The Underworld","platforms":[{"id":3,"name":"Linux"},{"id":6,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"},{"id":14,"name":"Mac"}],"screenshots":[{"id":6839,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/th2hmc2ybmildsmz6frf.jpg"},{"id":6840,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/aqovn0flgz2rgf8u4em2.jpg"},{"id":6841,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/u9hpqdlwhzixsqeaf3sv.jpg"},{"id":6842,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/bmd6gr67ll8nm2hfdgl6.jpg"},{"id":6843,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/za3ze6wbwujet0wsumlq.jpg"}],"summary":"Doorways is a survival horror game in which nothing is what it seems.

The characters have a \"super-deformed\" touch. There is also voice acting during cut-scenes. A new option has been added to the menu, which allows the player to read a conversation between party members and receive advice from them.\n\nIt also features many gameplay additions. The difficulty level has been increased, not only beyond the difficulty of the Western SNES release (which was reduced compared to Japanese original and subsequent ports), but even beyond the original difficulty. The party members are still bound by class, but they can now hunt for so-called \"augments\", which can be found or stolen from enemies and which grant the characters additional bonus abilities, resistances, spells that their class would normally not allow, etc.\n\nBeside those major changes, there are also plenty of minor additions. It is possible to obtain bonus items after exploring every corner and filling 100% of an area map; Rydia, the summoner girl, has a new monster summon who can be customized in various ways; there is a new quest involving the \"naming\" moogle of the original game, etc.","tags":[1,17,268435468,268435487,536870988,536871208,536871250,536871758,536871851,536871938,536872070,536872098,536872352,536872406,536872626,536872983,536873384,536874395,536874743,536874916,536875046,536875050,536875062,536875073,536875265,536875318,536875361,536875426,536875490,536875738,536875745,536875764,536875778,536875886,536875910,536876007,536876219,536876242,536876378,536876489,536876495,536876505,536876507,536876589,536876593,536876875,536876976,536876996,536877000,536877237,536877238,536877301,536877373,536877380,536877383,536877454,536877528,536877532,536877987,536878097,536878127,536878382,536878589,536879696,536879765,536879895,536879908,536879917,536880094,536880195,536880234,536880240,536880241,536880261,536880286,536880508,536880918,536880920,536881123,536882193,536883162,536883639,536883640],"videos":[{"id":48146,"video_id":"119Ay49BsGg"},{"id":48147,"video_id":"qMOUJcPfU6w"}]},{"id":1214,"cover":{"id":137147,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co2xtn.jpg"},"name":"Dark Cloud","platforms":[{"id":8,"name":"PlayStation 2"},{"id":48,"name":"PlayStation 4"}],"screenshots":[{"id":508783,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scawkv.jpg"},{"id":508784,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scawkw.jpg"},{"id":508785,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scawkx.jpg"},{"id":508786,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scawky.jpg"},{"id":508787,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scawkz.jpg"},{"id":508788,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scawl0.jpg"},{"id":508789,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scawl1.jpg"}],"summary":"One of the PS2's first RPGs, Dark Cloud is a title that challenges players to not only strategise, battle and solve puzzles, but also to create geographical landscapes using the new Georama system.

Earth forces now use advanced mecha called Humanoid Walking Tanks (HWTs) to combat the invaders, but throughout the ordeal, far too many pilots have been killed in action.\n\nTo ensure the future of the human race, the Japanese government enforced a student draft which recruited high school students to become HWT pilots.

They are young people such as Atsushi Hayami and his high school class, also known as Unit 5121.

Dungeon Master was a realtime game instead of the traditional turn-based approach that was prevalent until then. Instead of using text-based commands to interact with the environment, players directly manipulated objects and the environment by clicking the mouse in the enlarged first-person view. \n \nAbstract Dungeons and Dragons style experience points and levels were eschewed in favor of a system where the characters' skills were improved directly via using them. It also introduced some novel control methods including the spell casting system, which involved learning sequences of runes which represented the form and function of a spell's effect. For example, a fireball spell was created by mixing the fire symbol with the wing symbol. This kind of attention to detail and focus on the user interface was typical of the game and helped create an often captivating sense of craft and ingenuity. Other factors in immersiveness were the then-revolutionary use of sound effects to indicate when a creature was nearby, and (primitive) dynamic lighting.","tags":[1,17,268435468,536871059,536871076,536871138,536871162,536871208,536871390,536871905,536871938,536872121,536872425,536875242,536875760,536875778,536875791,536876111,536876597,536876607,536877579,536878360,536878422],"videos":[{"id":30533,"video_id":"xmrBwezb4bw"}]}]
