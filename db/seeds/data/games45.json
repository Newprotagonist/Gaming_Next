These are the players of Worlds Adrift: Explorers of a new world and seekers of ancient knowledge. \n \nWithin the coveted ruins of the past, cryptic and forgotten fragments of the technologies developed by civilizations who built much, and over saw the collapse of it all. Harnessing such forgotten knowledge, players build greater and more powerful skyships that carry them further, past the crushing wind walls, through devastating lightning storms, to entirely undiscovered islands holding the mysteries of an earlier age.",

They\u0027d been waiting up there, but I didn\u0027t keep one flight high- a rookie mistake! Now we were all low and slow- meat to those guys. \n \n\"Break!\" I shouted as I kicked the rudder. As tracer fire flew past me, I jammed the stick into my stomach and felt the Mustang shake as she approached departure. Spin now, this low, and I\u0027m dead; but a gentle turn was not an alternative. \n \nAn explosion! Next thing I saw was a Focke Wulf tumbling, belching smoke. \"Thought y\u0027all could use a hand,\" I heard in a soft, Texas accent. It was Killer of the 335th. That voice and handle never went together. The FWs scattered. Time to reacquire those jets. \n \nOnly in Air Warrior can you experience air combat with this kind of realism while flying in any of 19 legendary warplanes of the World War II era.

Film your toughest missions and re-fly them to sharpen your skills even further. Go head-to-head against a friend or foe in modem-to-modem airspace. And once you think you have the mettle for on-line air combat, take to the skies as a \"lone wolf\" or in a squadron with up to 100 simultaneous combatants from across North America and Japan. \n \nHey!...

After discovering a time machine, the kids accidentally scatter themselves throughout history, and you\u0027re the only one who can reunite the famous babies with their beloved cohorts. Each of the game\u0027s 12 levels puts you in charge of a different character, charging you with tasks like finding a lost toy, locating fellow Rugrats, or tracking down mysterious items. The whole debacle begins when Chuckie won\u0027t enter the time machine with the other babies, but he changes his mind as soon as the rest if the gang disappears and leaves him all alone. Chuckie\u0027s attempt to track down the others puts him in the 1800s, but none of his friends are there. In fact, Tommy is in ancient Egypt, Angelica is at an old circus, Phil is trapped in prehistory, and Dil is, somehow, lost in space! Can you collect all of the lost items and round up the babies before it\u0027s too late?",

In a race against time, both the corporation and insurgents will stop at nothing to find the cure and reclaim the Earth. As the virus inevitably spreads through Tharsis colony, the players must fight the mutants, the storm and the odds to find the cure before it\u0027s too late.\n\nBy forming an unlikely alliance, a corporate grunt and an insurgent drone with a mind of its own, narrowly escape destruction. During their attempt to evacuate, they realize that the cure exists, but also that the STROL virus has developed an intelligent form, and a deadly plan to infest all of Mars. In a struggle to stop the virus, they discover who is responsible for the spread of the epidemic. And as the odds of survival plummet, the stakes keep going up."

    "summary": "In Search of the Lost Words (1996) is an enchanting educational game geared toward building reading and comprehension skills in older children. The graphics are charming, and the gameplay quickly becomes immersive, drawing the player into a simple but interesting storyline. \n \nGameplay \n \nThe interface is intuitive and easy to use; a simple point and click selects and names objects, some of which are highlighted for later use in a sidebar. Each object when clicked will reward you with a cute animation, and some are gateways to minigames, mostly memory and match-up challenges, all the way through the main action that give you extra adverbs and adjectives that come in useful later. At the end of each stage, there is a section of the story of the egg, and by extension the creature, that has gaps in it that you must fill with the “lost words” of the title. \n \nOnce you’ve found every word (and some of them are not obvious at all, like clicking on a large vase only to have it called a parrot because that’s what was hiding in it) you can proceed to the next phase of your journey.",

All of the games can be started from one application, so you can jump between playing The First Encounter level to a Serious Sam 3 level and back without exiting the game. When listing game servers, servers playing TFE, TSE, SS3 – will all appear in the same list and you can vote map across games if you want. Oh, and owners of our VR games are able to play multiplayer together with their \"flat\" counterparts! \nSince there are so many changes and exciting new features, we\u0027ll just go ahead a list them here as bullet points. \n \nCool new features in Serious Sam Fusion 2017: \n \n- All games now support SteamOS/Linux/OSX! \n- Split-screen! \n- 64bit executables \n- Support for Vulkan API (DirectX9 is now being removed) \n- Multithreaded rendering \n- The new \"light-weight\" savegame system - savegames are now saved much faster, are very small and stored in the Steam cloud, and savegames still work even if a level is changed in a patch, or if a mod is updated \n- Full support for all controllers including Steam controller, PS4 gamepads, all older DInput joysticks \n- Proper multimonitor support \n- Borderless window support \n- Customizable sound outputs \n- Proper 3D audio using a proprietary sound-mixer (the same approach as used in the old Classic games) \n- Improved physics engine with better handling of character movement \n- Texture streaming in all games \n- Much better modding support with customizable weapons and items, improved scripting (including better support for scripting networked games) \n- Lots of other improvements, optimizations and fixes",

However, his plans to prevent the King from having a heir have failed. For the good wizard Troda has intervened and saved Atamus, the young prince. You are that young prince, and you have returned to the castle to try to lift the curse. The doors are closed behind you. If you fail, the place will be doomed forever. Grackon\u0027s curse is a 1st person point and click adventure that plays in a 3D environment. All actions take place within the castle. The action window covers about 1/3 of the screen when the player simply walks through the corridors and rooms of the castle, but the close-ups are a bit bigger. At each stopping point the player can pan around at 90 degrees intervals. While examining some places/objects, the player will hear voices of the persons that have disappeared (not captioned). The game has six saving slots. The player can die in the game.",

And the number of people who actually earned the title of Gauntlet Knight was even smaller. \nIn other words, it was becoming an era where all existing military forces would be obsolete, and where the military might of the world would be measured by the small number of boys and girls who could use Gauntlets... \n \nAfter competing against each other in the International Battle Standard Festival, a group of Gauntlet Knights from all over the world became fast friends, swearing to support the walls of peace from both sides and prevent another World War from ever occurring. However, World War IV was steadily approaching, like a line of falling dominos... \nThe young are supposed to be the main characters in their own eras. \n \nBut in reality, they\u0027re nothing but game pieces lined up on the board of those who are crafty and more experienced. \nMust these boys and girls be forced to kill each other as pieces? \nWho are the pieces, and who are the players? And who does the players\u0027 bidding? \nWhat victory conditions does each person have? Is it peace? War? Annihilation? \nIs the foretold tragedy a scheme or a delusion, the future or reality? \nNo. \nThere is no need to resist this tragedy. \nThe job of a game piece is to dance about within the tragedy\u0027s grasp. \nWhat are the rules of the game, you ask? How hard is it? That\u0027s for us to decide, so it\u0027s none of your concern. \nAll you people need to do is take pieces and get taken yourselves, entertaining us with the range of your emotions. \nAre you listening? You don\u0027t want to misunderstand your position. \n \nYou aren\u0027t my opponent. You\u0027re merely a piece that exists for my amusement. \nIn this next game, I won\u0027t give you the privilege of being a player! \n \nConfirmed for 4 Phases.",

That thing barely helped clean the NES, just as NES Virus Cleaner doesn’t do much for removing “viruses” from your NES. You guide Clik, the hero, around inside your NES and grab viruses in the various spots they are placed. The ultimate goal is to get to the lockout chip and destroy Virii, the main virus. The obstacles in the game are electric bolts, electric sparks, disappearing blocks, a homing missile system, and of course, time. If you run out of time on a certain level, the game is over. If you get hit by an enemy, you will respawn at the point where you picked up the last virus. It’s a pretty simple concept overall. I tried to cover everything in the tutorial, but I did in fact miss the part about respawning at the last picked up virus. Oh well, things happen!",

Unlike previous games in the series, Burnout Crash! is played from a bird\u0027s-eye or aerial view. Points are earned for causing damage and destroying the environment and other vehicles. Leaderboards powered by EA\u0027s Autolog service enable players to compare scores with other players. \n \nThe game features three game modes and six different intersections to play, as well as seven drivable vehicles, for example the Vegas Saloon. The Xbox 360 version of the game also includes a Kinect mode, allowing players to use gestures to control the game.",

It was the first game to run on Namco\u0027s then new System 2 hardware, and is a direct successor to Namco\u0027s two earlier Pole Position games (1982-1983). \n \nFinal Lap was the first racing game to allow up to eight players to simultaneously race on the Suzuka Circuit, in a Formula One race. This was, at the time, considered a revolutionary feature and was implemented by linking together up to four two-player sitdown-style arcade cabinets.[2][3] It was also arguably the first racing game to implement \"rubber banding\" to ensure that less talented players were never too far behind the leader, a concept that would be taken much further by the Mario Kart series.[3] There was also a single player mode, in which the player\u0027s score was based on how far the car travelled until time ran out or if the player completed four laps (on default settings; the arcade operator can set the lap number to be as low as three or as high as six).",

    "summary": "Ultimate Soccer Manager or USM is an association football management video game serie for MS-DOS, Commodore Amiga and Windows 95, produced by Impressions and distributed by Sierra from 1995 to 1999. The game was a massive hit in Europe (except in Germany, where it was worse received due to some similarities with managers produced by local software houses such as Software 2000 and Ascaron), although it gained little support in Japan. \n \nThe series was noted for its micromanagement, where the player had to do the job of the team manager and much of that of the chairman, from player training up to bank balance management. Other well-known features were to bung an opposing team for preferential market treatment, rig or betting on the outcome of the players\u0027 team matches. Interviews after the match where some answers were printed with different interpretations on the next days\u0027 newspaper (the player could reply a question about the game with \"It was a game of two halves\", and \"He amazed us after the game by giving us an insight into the rules of football\" would be printed on the newspapers). \n \nIn all three games, the game always kept the same visual style: the main screen is a bird\u0027s eye view of the stadium facility (where clicking on the grass brings the squad selection screen or in the stands for the stadium builder) and all screens are presented like the player was inside an office (TCM 2004 used a similar interface option). To increase the feeling of \"being there\", tables are accessed via teletext, news from a newspaper and fixtures are available by clicking on a sheet attached to a clipboard. \n \nWhile improving with each game, most features were the same from the start of the series. The game compared favourably in all areas but AI against its leading competitor, Championship Manager. While similar in name, it has no relations with Ultimate Soccer. \n \nThe second version of the game, USM 2 ran in protected mode, featured a more polished interface (plus teams and players of the 1996-1997 season and also the French and German leagues (although in the last the final name of the players had a letter swapped to avoid legal problems regarding licensing) which could be accessed with different executables. In Germany, a localized version of the game was released under the name \"DSF Fussball Manager\", DSF being a well-known German TV sports channel.",
