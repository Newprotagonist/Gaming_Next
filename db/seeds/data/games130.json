There were six annual versions of the game released, started with High Heat Baseball 1999, and ending with High Heat Major League Baseball 2004.\n\nThe game, featuring the official licensed team and player names from all 30 MLB teams, was created by games company 3DO which subsequently filed for bankruptcy in 2003 soon after the release of the final version of the series, High Heat Major League Baseball 2004. In August 2003, Microsoft purchased the rights to the High Heat franchise from 3DO, however, Microsoft has yet to develop a new title in the series.\n\nHigh Heat was traditionally known for possessing more simulation-style qualities than competitors World Series Baseball, All Star Baseball, or Triple Play Baseball, but frequently lagged behind in graphical quality. At the core of High Heat′s gameplay was its batter-pitcher interface, which was often hailed as the most realistic of its era.","tags":[268435470,536870932,536872078,536872352,536875138,536875257,536875562,536876135,536876136,536876137,536876138,536876139,536876140,536876141,536876142,536876143,536876144,536876145,536876146,536876147,536876148,536876149,536876150,536876151,536876152,536876153,536876154,536876155,536876156,536876157,536876158,536876159,536876160,536876161,536876163,536876164,536876165,536876190,536878111,536878341,536884030]},{"id":8506,"aggregated_rating":79.0,"cover":{"id":106702,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co2aby.jpg"},"name":"Xeodrifter","platforms":[{"id":6,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"},{"id":37,"name":"Nintendo 3DS"},{"id":41,"name":"Wii U"},{"id":46,"name":"PlayStation Vita"},{"id":48,"name":"PlayStation 4"},{"id":130,"name":"Nintendo Switch"}],"screenshots":[{"id":8166,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/tee1mscx9i0e4dbxpjbr.jpg"},{"id":8167,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/lyfgye7uuhi47wagn174.jpg"},{"id":8168,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/lgko1tkxigjnjvntcgju.jpg"},{"id":8169,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/nc37jsoc1flbiw3hrbiz.jpg"},{"id":8170,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/f1scwk7597kv447zqm4c.jpg"},{"id":184550,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/dkbwvbhkl5pi6uocoxec.jpg"},{"id":184551,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/bqsab8a4a0eul7qa6sm7.jpg"},{"id":184552,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/xjktltoj8l3fe0bfuedf.jpg"},{"id":184553,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/jbtxt3rvhw12qeg9djpl.jpg"},{"id":184554,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/wdrn2mtjxxfsgm6bo1tg.jpg"},{"id":184555,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/lsllrbp9tolev7bigqh6.jpg"}],"summary":"Xeodrifter is an action-packed exploration game with a retro graphical style.

In the Resident Evil series it is the second title exclusive to the Wii platform. The game's plot revolves around the personal stories and tragedies in the series, with its main focus on retelling the events of Resident Evil 2 and Resident Evil: Code: Veronica.\n\nA new chapter called Operation Javier fleshes out the plot further and explains the motives of Resident Evil 4 villain Jack Krauser. It takes place in 2002 and is set in the waterside village of Mixcoatl, located in the South American Amparo. It tells the story of Leon S. Kennedy teaming up with Jack Krauser to investigate the connections of crime lord Javier Hidalgo to a former Umbrella researcher.\n\nJust like The Umbrella Chronicles players do not control the character's movement, but only the shooting aspect, shown from a first-person perspective.

Offer up the resources to Inanna and use the goats to trade for new workshops and abilities. Only the swiftest and cleverest noble will become the ruler of Sumer.\n\nA Worker Placement Video Game!\nSumer takes the board game mechanic of worker placement to a new level. Each day, you and your competitors will awaken at dawn to begin your worship. Run and jump around the ziggurat to place your workers so they'll collect resources. You only have 2 workers, so you better figure out your strategy, move fast, and claim workshops before your friends beat you to it!\n\nReal-time Dynamic Auctions!\nWhoever is willing to sacrifice the most goats gets Inanna's blessing! The auction is simple — just move left or right to change your bid in real time. Each auction is a mind game of bluffing and bravado, and you never know an item’s real price until time is up! Trick your opponents into overpaying for their bids while you snag good bargains for your own!\n\nKey Features\n1-4 players - Play local with up to 4 players.

Steam is also used to deliver additional routes and locomotives in the form of DLC.

Farm peacefully, engage in political mind games or lay siege to sworn enemies. \n \nBesiege the castle that’s never been taken, overthrow ruthless tyrants, bankroll your faction’s war effort, pillage your neighbour’s resources, peacefully raise cattle or do it all! A range of stats, rankings and achievements gives every player something to aim for, from ‘Banquet King’ and ‘Peacebringer’ to 'Besieger of the Month' and ‘Lionheart'! Factions, elections, liege lords and their vassals all provide a real sense of structured community, with many different ways to chat with other players, discuss strategies and build allegiances. \n \nWhile an impregnable castle should be at the heart of any lord or lady's domain, you can also specialise with a vast research tree. Starting as a humble peasant, each promotion brings with it valuable research points to spend on trading, diplomacy, warfare, farming, religion and more. Be aware though, as your power grows so does your responsibility. Your vassals and parishioners will look to you for guidance and leadership.
