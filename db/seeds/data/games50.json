Surviving humans found a shelter on a planet called Jorune. A civil war errupted, humans fighting the indigenous population; eventually, peace was achieved, and the various races found a way to co-exist with each other... all except one. The Shantha, one of the most ancient and powerful races on Jorune, adepts at the magical art of Isho, were not satisfied with the shape the planet has taken. 3500 years later, one of them, known as the Red Shantha, began attacking human settlements. The hero of the game is one of the villagers who have survived Red Shantha's attack. Having found the way to master Isho, the hero must rescue his friends and explore the planet, searching for the source of evil. \n \nAlien Logic is based on the Skyrealms of Jorune role-playing system. The player takes control of one character; there is no party in the game. While there is a story to follow, much of the game is open-ended, dedicated to exploring Jorune, searching for items, precious crystals (which increase the hero's parameters), and fighting enemies. The exploration mode uses a side-scrolling perspective; the player can switch to combat mode when an enemy is nearby. Combat takes place on the same screen as exploration, and is action-based. Combat relies heavily on magic (Isho); casting spells deplete the Isho bar. Spell sequences are called dyshas, which can be offensive or defensive. Preparing dysha combinations beforehand and then using them on the enemies (by clicking on them) is an essential combat strategy.","tags":[1,17,18,268435465,268435468,268435487,536870915,536871882,536871938,536871939,536873335,536873787,536876299]},{"id":43249,"name":"ESPN Baseball 2K4","platforms":[{"id":8,"name":"PlayStation 2"}],"summary":"Spiritual successor to World Series Baseball, ESPN MLB raises the bar with Power Pitching, Online Gameplay and ESPN presentation featuring Jon Miller and Karl Ravech.

Will your prison disregard human rights, impose intentional harshness and be devoid of any notions of wellbeing and freedom? The choice is yours. \n\nIn Prison Architect you will see the impact of your grand design on the lives of your inmates; be it a utopic center for rehabilitation, a brutal Super Max Prison or anything in between. Even when all of your prisoners’ needs are met, remember one thing - it’s still a prison and no one really wants to be there.\n\nStart your journey into the world of Prison Architect by playing through the Prison Stories (campaign). Here you’ll learn the ropes by being brought in to equip a small prison with everything it needs to perform its first execution, all before being called up to deal with emergencies at larger and larger prisons. You’ll quickly learn how to cope with blazing infernos, hostage situations and prison wide riots - if you make it through all that unscathed, the Mayor will be ready to give you the reigns of a brand new prison development where you can build the prison of your dreams.\n\nBuild and Manage A Maximum Security Prison\n\nOnce you are ready to begin building your own prison, in Architect Mode (sandbox) you can either choose to take control of one of several pre-built prisons right away or build one entirely from scratch.\n\nActing as both architect and governor, you control every detail of your Prison - from building new cells and facilities to hiring staff and creating reform programs - all while dealing with informants, contraband smuggling, gang warfare, full scale riots and more!\n\nOnce your prison is built, go online with World of Wardens to share your designs with the community.

Game world will consist of several biomes: jungle, desert, sea and snow. These worlds will be unique all the time because they will be randomly generated. Islands and natural elements will have certain similarities, but altogether the world will be unique every time.           \n           \nhttps://i1.wp.com/floatlands.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/scorched-sunset-lowpoly-floatlands.png           \n               \n           \n* QUESTING, POINTS OF INTEREST - There will be random events/quests (defending, collecting, exploring) across the world for you to complete.

Some basics: Shooting down robot enemies will provide you scrap metal; by chopping trees you will gain wood; sheep is a source for wool; you will also find resources in caves. Certain materials need to be processed and smelted in order to be used for building structures. \n \n* CUSTOM BUILD MODE - With gathered resources you’ll be able to build and upgrade your own custom base/shelter and defend from enemies. At this moment there are 50 different build parts you can use to build your base. There are also 3 tiers – wood (starting tier), stone and fortified stone (highest tier for now). Build mode mixed with random generated terrain provides a multitude of options (basic shacks, castles…), so it will be interesting in this regard. \n \n* ELECTRIC SYSTEM - One other major feature in game is electricity which will provide you with different options in the game - repairing your robot, powering up the lights and your defense system (turrets). We are in the process of making various props that will need a source of energy. Generators will be that source and with cables you'll have the option to connect devices yourself.  You will have to fill generators with fuel to get them to work. \n \nhttps://i1.wp.com/floatlands.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/electricity_connection_lowpoly_floatlands.png","tags":[21,268435460,268435487,268435488,536870984,536871251,536873669],"videos":[{"id":11947,"video_id":"g3he1qA77Nw"},{"id":12536,"video_id":"JcaqXg5zugI"},{"id":13737,"video_id":"8VYRFeMcBpA"},{"id":13738,"video_id":"hyojPG2LCu4"},{"id":17683,"video_id":"nLbukAPiLoA"}]},{"id":139563,"cover":{"id":136151,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co2x1z.jpg"},"name":"Valkyria Chronicles 3: Penalty Mission - Things to Shoot Through DLC","platforms":[{"id":38,"name":"PlayStation Portable"}],"screenshots":[{"id":403311,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc8n73.jpg"},{"id":403312,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc8n74.jpg"},{"id":403313,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc8n75.jpg"}],"summary":"Escort an armored car safely from the armed supply base before being targeted by a powerful sniper who also penetrates steel!","tags":[1,17,31,39,268435468,268435472,268435480,536870990,536871390,536871433,536871453,536871517,536871986,536872453,536873174,536873551,536873587,536876243,536878299,536889728,536896177,536896220,536896857,536897009,536897012,536897014]},{"id":5434,"aggregated_rating":62.5,"cover":{"id":118582,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co2jhy.jpg"},"name":"Shadow of the Beast","platforms":[{"id":15,"name":"Commodore C64/128"},{"id":16,"name":"Amiga"},{"id":19,"name":"Super Nintendo Entertainment System (SNES)"},{"id":25,"name":"Amstrad CPC"},{"id":26,"name":"ZX Spectrum"},{"id":29,"name":"Sega Mega Drive/Genesis"},{"id":61,"name":"Atari Lynx"},{"id":63,"name":"Atari ST/STE"},{"id":64,"name":"Sega Master System"},{"id":118,"name":"FM Towns"}],"screenshots":[{"id":12885,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/z6oucpuiascrkvdorfqq.jpg"},{"id":12886,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/arak1jmb6dgsqrbvts2e.jpg"}],"summary":"A game that takes your computer into a totally new dimension.\n\nShadow of the Beast is the most stunning 16-bit game you've ever played- a game that pushes your computer's features further than you ever thought they could go.

Destination Earth","platforms":[{"id":7,"name":"PlayStation"}],"summary":"Galaga, the \"slide-and-shoot\" arcade classic from 1981, has been updated with nine new worlds, 3D graphics, futuristic backgrounds and more in GALAGA -- Destination: Earth.\n\nIt is late in the 22nd century, and the insect-like Galaga are back. Humans have terraformed and colonized most habitable places in our solar system, but the Galaga have only one thing in mind: destruction. The Galaga are mutated nanites that were inadvertently created during the terraforming process. They are deadly, autonomous and great in number, and you must blast them into oblivion. In addition to shooting Galaga, you must perform various mission objectives, such as collecting life pods and activating water turbines.\n\nLike in the original game, you begin this enhanced version of Galaga controlling a ship that moves horizontally along the bottom of the playfield and fires upward at wave after wave of diving, swirling aliens that eventually fly into formation. However, unlike the original, this game, depending on what mission you are playing, features a number of other viewpoints, including over the shoulder, top down and side on. You can fire just two shots at a time, but you can gain the ability to have three shots onscreen at once.\n\nAlso like the original game, GALAGA -- Destination: Earth features challenge waves in which you blast streams of enemies for points while not having to worry about your own safety. And, of course, you can let a Galaga capture your ship, then shoot your ship's captor, letting the captured ship fall to you, enabling you to double your firepower. Similar to Gaplus, the sequel to classic Galaga, this game also lets you collect beam power-ups that enable you to capture enemies, place them by your side and use their weapons.","tags":[1,18,268435461,536871859,536871882,536871937,536872352,536872651,536873064,536876391,536876953,536878084]},{"id":127175,"cover":{"id":169393,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co3mpd.jpg"},"name":"Canadian Robot Racing League","platforms":[{"id":6,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}],"screenshots":[{"id":365423,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc7tyn.jpg"},{"id":365424,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc7tyo.jpg"},{"id":365425,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc7typ.jpg"},{"id":365426,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc7tyq.jpg"},{"id":365427,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc7tyr.jpg"},{"id":365428,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc7tys.jpg"},{"id":365429,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc7tyt.jpg"},{"id":365430,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc7tyu.jpg"},{"id":365431,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc7tyv.jpg"},{"id":365432,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc7tyw.jpg"}],"summary":"A survival platforming challenge!

Before each battle, you are able to see the stats of the monsters and even the tactics they are going to use. You must then select seven units of various classes (knights, archers, mages, etc.) and place them on a battle field, which is a grid composed of four columns and three rows. Front row can attack, middle row support or attack with bows, and back row heals.

While in The World, the player controls the on-screen player character, Haseo, from a third-person person perspective (with optional first-person mode). The player may control the camera using the game controller's right analog stick. Within the fictional game, players explore monster-infested fields and dungeons as well as \"Root Towns\" that are free of combat. They also can \"log-off\" from the game and return to a computer desktop interface which includes in-game e-mail, news, and message boards, as well as desktop and background music customization options. In Reminisce, an optional card game called \"Crimson VS\" becomes available. The player may save the game to a memory card both from the desktop and within The World at a Save Shop. After the player completes the game, a Data Flag appears on the save file, which allows the transfer of all aspects of the player character and party members to the next game in the series. This can also be applied to previous games if the player first finished the Reminsce or Redemption.\n\nPlayers can attack monsters in real time. However, the action pauses whenever the menu is opened in order to select magic to cast, items to use, or skills to perform. The player only directly controls Haseo, while the other characters are controlled by artificial intelligence. The player may either provide guidelines (\"Free Will\", \"Rage\", \"Life\", etc.) or issue direct commands (for example, to cast a particular magic at a particular enemy) to the computer-controlled characters. Monsters roam the environments freely or guard treasure chests. Once combat is initiated, via a \"surprise attack\" or the player being spotted, a wall erects around the combat area to prevent escape. Weapons give the player access to the Skill Trigger feature which allows them to perform a powerful attack at the cost of losing SPs. As an adept rogue character, Haseo can wield multiple weapons for close combat. Although Haseo can only use one weapon per battle, during Reminisce the player can change weapons in the middle of Skill Triggers. Under certain conditions, the player may execute an enhanced type of Skill Trigger called \"Rengeki\". These attacks deal greater damage and fill a Morale gauge, which allows the player and his team members to use a combination attack. Certain plot-related fights, called \"Avatar battles\", use a different interface which incorporates shoot 'em up gameplay elements. After depleting the opponent's health, players must charge up a \"Data Drain\" to end the battle.\n\nRoot Towns are non-combat areas in The World. The player may restock on items, buy equipment, or chat and trade with other \"players\" of The World. The player may also undertake optional quests and visit guilds. A key feature of all towns is the Chaos Gate. This blue portal is used to travel between towns (called \"servers\") as well as access the fields and dungeons where battles take place. A password system controls the characteristics of each area. Depending on the characteristics of each word in the three word phrase, the resulting area may have different attributes such as prevalence of monsters or items, among other features.","tags":[1,17,18,268435468,536870990,536871015,536871138,536871208,536871213,536871433,536871938,536872201,536872352,536872587,536872647,536872898,536872957,536873473,536874094,536875053,536875132,536875196,536875241,536875314,536875356,536875409,536875455,536875523,536875556,536875621,536875774,536875796,536875830,536875868,536875944,536875952,536876232,536876243,536876266,536876281,536876306,536876320,536876388,536876498,536876503,536876847,536876976,536877405,536877494,536877535,536877628,536877939,536878078,536878505,536879224,536879228,536879229,536880577,536882918,536884018,536887528],"videos":[{"id":5370,"video_id":"_DaKYtv4I9I"}]},{"id":28210,"aggregated_rating":85.0,"cover":{"id":198612,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co4990.jpg"},"name":"Dark Souls III: The Fire Fades Edition","platforms":[{"id":6,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"},{"id":48,"name":"PlayStation 4"},{"id":49,"name":"Xbox One"}],"screenshots":[{"id":108781,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/xbve3n1hnhyxeii13bn4.jpg"}],"summary":"The Dark Souls III: The Fire Fades Edition delivers the complete Dark Souls III experience and includes the full game & all Season Pass content - Ashes of Ariandel and The Ringed City DLC expansions.

It is the third game in the Valkyria Chronicles series and was released on January 27, 2011 exclusively in Japan. An expanded version of the game, subtitled Extra Edition was released in Japan on November 23, 2011. The game features an opening song Moshimo Kimi ga Negau no Nara sung by Japanese singer May'n.\n\nOccurring in the same time frame as the first game, Valkyria Chronicles III is a side story that follows the exploits of an unwanted and castigated Gallian Army squad during the Imperial invasion of 1935. Contrasting the previous games' bright outlook and recognition for their protagonists, Valkyria Chronicles III explores the themes of being outcast and the search for redemption. As described by its catchphrase, the game tells \"The tale of nameless soldiers who, on the verge of despair, changed history.\"\n\nThe game was the first in the series to not officially be translated into English by Sega. However, an unofficial fan translation for the Extra Edition was eventually released in December 2013.","tags":[1,17,31,39,268435468,268435472,268435480,536870959,536870990,536871433,536871490,536871517,536871986,536872453,536873551,536873587,536873726,536874038,536876243,536889728,536895820,536896177,536896220,536896857,536897009,536897014],"videos":[{"id":6270,"video_id":"PkTrG32t8Lg"}]},{"id":74193,"name":"PROJECT AZRIEL","platforms":[{"id":6,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"},{"id":14,"name":"Mac"}],"screenshots":[{"id":128399,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/u2zyuvmvlskz3p3za4wj.jpg"},{"id":128400,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/iubufr8zkfw00sam23q3.jpg"},{"id":128401,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/zxjwnsow00fon13o0ttp.jpg"},{"id":128402,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/xjuobkkfblqghbretxtu.jpg"},{"id":128403,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sghhbxc3ekc6ittmzoem.jpg"}],"summary":"The least boring brain trainer in the world.

As Izzy Buspec, the newest recruit to Randco, take charge of their patented revolver as you explore the densely packed biomes of Corvynnia, bringing down hordes of docile robots in a money-making adventure. Every time you fire, you'll have to answer one of over 2,000 trivia questions with answers based on numbers, percentages, geography, dates, and more - the further you are from the actual answer, the more of its own ammunition the revolver will discharge. If you run out, it's back to Randco HQ to reload! Revolver and Co features 105 story levels across 7 unique worlds and 12 question themes which will test you on a wide range of subjects, tied together with humorous debriefings between Izzy and her maniacal boss before the start of each mission. Or if you're looking for more of a challenge, have a go at one of the Endless challenges, which pits you against a barrage of questions until you finally succumb to an empty revolver chamber. You can even unlock more Endless challenges by completing the story levels, including a gruelling hour-long session where the only thing you have to lose is time.","tags":[268435465,268435487,268435488]},{"id":76691,"cover":{"id":105505,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co29ep.jpg"},"name":"Air Dash","platforms":[{"id":6,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}],"screenshots":[{"id":138262,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/zuzf7xwymvxucklxisv5.jpg"},{"id":138263,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/iqpjsebk2axt2xdyq6lt.jpg"},{"id":138264,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/f9qaonor019rwtzr32q2.jpg"},{"id":138265,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/uztzk0s4ofatnbhg9zr3.jpg"},{"id":138266,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/drlli8rf9vs8a6lhif7g.jpg"}],"summary":"Minimalist style, frantic time management and equipment management game of managing a Budget Airline Tycoon.
