League, being published on November 22, almost two weeks later after the end of that season. At the time of its release J.League Jikkyō Winning Eleven 97 was considered to be the most realistic soccer game for the PlayStation or any other console. It featured narration by Jon Kabira and commentary by Yasutaro Matsuki, a former Japanese football player and manager. \nThe 1996 season can be included in the \"Golden Age\" as in back then J.League was at its popularity peak, and many likeable superstars were playing in it: Guido Buchwald, Uwe Bein, Dragan Stojković, Salvatore Schillaci, Ivan Hašek, Dunga, Edílson, Jorginho, Mazinho, Careca, Ruy Ramos, Hidetoshi Nakata, among many others. \nBoth the playstyle and the league format (double stage with Victory Goal and Final match at the end) were very characteristic and promoted overly offensive, stylish and spectacular football. \nUp to two players can compete in a series of games that include: Exhibition, full J.League season, Hyper cup, All-Star match and Penalty Kick modes. It is also possible to view the players\u0027 profile.",

Above ground, peace returned again. \n \nHalf a year passed, suddenly the Blocks began to overflow in three nations.One after another America, India and Egypt became flooded in blocks. \n \nSusumu Hori and his Rival Driller, Anna Hottenmeyer; urgently began to dig to the depths of the earth. Meanwhile, Susumu\u0027s father, Taizou Hori; Susumu\u0027selder brother, Ataru Hori; Anna\u0027s Robot Assistant, Horinger Z and Susumu\u0027s roomate, Puchi, were all digging to the depths of the earth, aiming for the resolution of this disaster. \n \nWhat is the probable cause of this latest incident? \nAnd, among the 6 Drillers, who will be the one to resolve this disaster? \n \nOur hero can drill up, down, left and right. Drilling through single blocks would take forever, so it\u0027s fortunate that blocks of the same color form into groups that vanish when only one of the blocks is drilled. This allows for chain reactions, since vanishing blocks will often cause other blocks to fall and form new groups. Alas, these falling blocks are also deadly if they hit Mr. Driller. \n \nIf all Mr. Driller had to do was drill, life would be easy. But he also has to keep refilling his oxygen supply by collecting air capsules scattered throughout the blocks. The deeper he goes, the faster his air runs out. Hampering his progress even further are brown \"X-blocks\" that take five drill strikes to disappear and remove 20% of Mr. Driller\u0027s air when broken. \n \nThis game is a Japan-only port of the original Arcade game of the same name.",

However, in the long term you need the city to develop. This requires setting up trains that transport resources to where they are needed. These resources are used to build houses, and other buildings, increasing the number of passengers for your commuter trains.\n\nAs the city develops, new businesses will spring up, such as stadiums, high rise office blocks, and ski resorts.

    "summary": "Sakura Wars is a Strategy RPG that features a unique sim-based story system. An in-depth storyline exists, much like in any other RPG; however, the player\u0027s destiny in the game is not predetermined. Character interaction plays a major role, and your responses to the various characters in the game can ultimately change the story content and even the final outcome. The battle system is divided into two main parts; ground combat and air combat. Ground combat takes place using two-legged mechanized suits, which transform into jet fighters to take the fight to the sky. Every mech unit in the game can transform from battle mech mode to jet fighter mode during combat. Once transformed, weapons and movement methods will change as well. For example, the hero\u0027s ground mode utilizes a sword as his main weapon, but in jet mode he will use long-range missiles.",

    "summary": "Anna is a 2012 puzzle video game for Microsoft Windows, OS X and Linux.\n\nNarratively a psychological horror set in an abandoned sawmill nestled high in the Italian mountains, Anna challenges the player to uncover horrific clues and use them to solve puzzles related to the player character\u0027s dark past. The player\u0027s behavior does determine the mental health of the main character and change locations and unveil new secrets leading to different endings.\n\nOn 13 April 2013, the Extended Edition was released which added new environments, puzzles, user interface, music, improved graphics, and a new character.\n\nPLOT:\nThe storyline of Anna concerns an amnesiac man who dreams of a sawmill in the mountains near his town. He decides to go there to find out its connection to his missing memories and a woman named \"Anna\" who seems to be calling out for him, and enters the house by solving puzzles in the garden. He becomes aware that the house is haunted after seeing several strange phenomena.\n\nAs the protagonist explores, he begins to hear voices belonging to himself and the eponymous Anna, among others. Through these voices and texts found throughout the sawmill, he discovers that he has had an obsessive history with an ancient deity named Anna that he had since forgotten. However, the plot is ambiguous from this point; one interpretation holds that in times of yore, Anna would lure men into worship, causing them to murder those close to them or starve themselves at the feet of her statue, and after she seduced the protagonist, he murdered his own wife and children for threatening his relationship with Anna. The other interpretation paints the protagonist as the villain, meeting a human avatar of Anna in the forest and falling in love with her. However, after she left because of his obsession with her and abusive personality, he sacrificed children to summon her again.\n\nThe game has three main endings; in an inversion of the norm, the more effort that is put into achieving an ending, the less optimistic the conclusion will be. In the first scenario, the protagonist concludes that Anna was burnt as a witch centuries ago and leaves the house, vowing never to return. In the second ending, the protagonist reminisces about Anna, realizes that he cannot live without her, and opens himself up to possession by her, joining the multitude of mannequins that are found throughout the house. In the third ending, the protagonist remembers killing his real wife after she defiled Anna\u0027s statue, and finds the statue, along with dolls of his children, in a small chamber. As the tunnel to the chamber caves in, he realizes that he will stay in the chamber forever, but he does not care because he has \"Anna\" with him.\n\nThe plot is ambiguous due to the uncertainty of the protagonist as to whether or not the sawmill is real or merely a dream, as well as the strange phenomena that occur throughout the story and the vague and unconnected nature of the voices.\n\nDEVELOPMENT:\nDreampainters, the development studio, based the story on legends from the Val D\u0027Ayas region of Italy, particularly one about a sawmill where a lumberjack killed his family. They claimed that the game\u0027s focus was on mystery-solving and exploration, with the player being able to discover the plot at their own pace. One of Anna\u0027s particularly infamous features, the ability to pick up any object (no matter if it will be used later on in the game), was apparently based on the developers\u0027 hatred for adventure games and cartoons where the important objects were made more obvious to the viewer.\n\nAnna would reportedly have a feature whereby the game would interpret the player\u0027s actions to try and scare them; for example, if a player focused on a particular object for too long, that object would appear more often. However, no such feature appeared in the game. Dreampainters also claimed that the extent of the protagonist\u0027s descent into madness would determine the ending, but the ending was actually determined by when the player decided to leave the sawmill.\n\nRECEPTION:\nAnna received mixed reviews from critics. The graphics, story and sound were praised, but it was criticized for the obscurity of its narrative, complexity of its interface, and difficulty of its puzzles. The horror elements were both praised and criticized by different reviews; IGN said that the lack of death removed any sense of threat, while Zero Punctuation praised the horror but claimed the immersion was broken by the necessity of a walkthrough. It received a score of 49.13% on GameRankings and 55/100 on Metacritic.",

    "summary": "Dark Legions is an action based strategy game. The player may play against the computer or another human on a strategic game board. In the beginning of the game, the player buys their forces with a predefined number of credits, and may purchase any of the 16 characters along with various kinds of traps and even rings of power to upgrade their creatures. One is chosen to be the \"Orb Keeper\". The Orb Keeper is like the King in chess: the game is over if he dies. Then players set up on a chosen map and start to move turn wise. When one player moves a piece into the same square as an opponent, the action is instantly transferred to another board map that represents the terrain upon which the two pieces occupy. Each player starts with their single piece on this \"melee map\" and must fight using their figures. The fight is simultaneously controlled in real time. \n \nEach figure type has unique abilities and at least two attack types. They can be roughly translated into categories however. This categories facing off against each other is the main focus of strategy. Simply put: Casters are hunted by Undead which are hunted by Fighters that fear the Casters spells. These categories are made up as a description and not an inherent part of the game. Hence some odd figures don\u0027t fit in any category.",

It gained its popularity by having mini games and the ability to play against friends in a challenge for the most points. It also involves trivia questions about South Park and other topics. \nThe game intermittently switches between questions and minigames, with a minigame proceeding every three questions. Players score points by answering questions first (correctly) and based on minigame ranking. Players lose points for questions answered incorrectly. The game is exclusively multiplayer, as when played by one player, there is no AI, so that player always wins, even with a negative score",

Players take on the role of Kyon and engage in various interactions with the main cast members and read the conversations that ensue. Although the story in Suzumiya Haruhi no Yakusoku is based on the \"The Sighs of Suzumiya Haruhi,\" the scenarios and overall material are new and written exclusively for the game. Multiple endings are also possible depending on the actions that one takes over the course of the game. In addition to the interactive experience, a number of mini-games are also playable at certain junctures including a simple beach volleyball diversion. Bandai touts a new \"Motion Portrait\" technology that\u0027s used in the game where lifelike facial expressions are imbued on the characters so that they appear to be \"living\" renditions of the heroines we\u0027ve grown to adore.",

The game was ported to Xbox, multiplayer functionality was added and environments were added to tie the game to the movie. But in 2009, Groove Games finally decided it was a good idea to finish Day of the Zombie and release it, even if the game has 2004 graphics. \nThe story, which is the only new thing compared to Land of the Dead, is about zombies who have invaded a town and 3 main characteres : a student who wants to save his girlfriend, the director of the student\u0027s college who wants to save his college from zombies, and a US army sniper who just wants to leave the town.",

A fully revamped version of the game was developed for the Sega Mega Drive/Genesis in 1991.\n\nSet in the year 4620, the game puts players in the role of a starship captain sent to explore the galaxy. There is no set path, allowing players to switch freely between mining, ship-to-ship combat, and alien diplomacy. The broader plot of the game emerges slowly, as the player discovers that an ancient race of beings is causing stars to flare and destroy all living creatures.",

    "summary": "Darius Gaiden is a two-dimensional shoot\u0027em up. The player controls a space ship named the Silver Hawk and must guide it through scrolling stages, destroying enemies and avoiding obstacles along the way. The ship is armed with forward-firing missiles, aerial bombs and a protective force-field, all of which can be upgraded by various power-ups that are dropped by specially-colored enemies when they are destroyed by the player. New to the Silver Hawk\u0027s arsenal in Darius Gaiden is the \u0027black hole bomb.\u0027 When fired, the black hole bomb will create a large vortex in the center of the screen, which sucks in enemies and projectiles on the screen for a short moment, until it explodes into a powerful ball of lightning that inflicts massive damage onto every enemy on the screen.\n\nAnother feature introduced Darius Gaiden is the ability to capture minibosses, who appear in every stage. Each miniboss has a small, circular ball placed on them that, after receiving enough damage, will detach and float away, causing the miniboss to turn idle. If the player collects the ball, the miniboss will follow and aid the player. After a brief period of time, or the player loses a life, the miniboss will explode.\n\nA few months following release, update to the arcade version was later released entitled \"Darius Gaiden Extra Edition\". This version of arcade game contains rearranged levels, as well as automatically-enabled auto fire, two extra weapon power levels (bigger wave shot and a bigger red wave shot as well) and an all-stage mode which can be accessed by starting the game in 2P side.",

The more visitors, the more resources you have to pamper your animals and transform your park into an all-star attraction. \n \nLearn to take care of the different animals (dolphins, killer whales, penguins, pink flamingos…) and also help to develop the sanctuary and make it larger so that it can welcome even more endangered animals. \nThe animals need a lot of attention: they need to be fed, taken care of, entertained and trained, in order to get them to amaze audiences with their special tricks. \n \nThanks to wireless connections, you will be able to invite your friends to your park to check out your animals.",

Well, mainly it was just the usual dungeon exterminator\u0027s subterranean grind: killing off thousands of roaches, chopping through tar, guzzling mimic potions, and generally ridding the King\u0027s underground chambers of all that should not be there. But also Beethro met an unexpected enemy, created lifelong grudges against him, and learned secrets that would later motivate his journey to Rooted Hold. \n \nDROD: Journey to Rooted Hold \nSwordplay and puzzles combine in this thinking man\u0027s dungeon crawl. It\u0027s simple to learn, with just a handful of commands to master. But the unique gameplay provides an amazing depth. A detailed overhead view shows monsters, obstacles, and other game elements. You have as much time as you like to contemplate your next move. So this is a good game for relaxing, but also terrifically involving once you get started. You\u0027ll be hooked by the story of Beethro and his troublesome nephew, Halph. Our heroes set off on a harmless jaunt, but end up far below the surface, chased by a clownish madman. They begin to uncover a vast, underground bureaucracy, and things only get stranger the further they delve. You\u0027ve got over 350 rooms ahead--each one a singular challenge for you to conquer. \n \nDROD: The City Beneath \nYou begin as a rather ugly man named \"Beethro\" who travels deep beneath the ground. There are other people down there too, citizens of a mysterious \"Rooted Empire\", that are carving tunnels and building things. Beethro just wants to know why, but it\u0027s hard to get a useful answer. He was always fond of saying \"there is no problem that can\u0027t be solved with a really big sword,\" but upon arriving at the underground capital, Beethro is startled to find that nobody seems interested in attacking him. No, for some reason, they would rather persuade him to stand in a very long line. \n25 sprawling levels with over 350 custom designed rooms, including secret rooms. \n17 types of monsters with greatly varying abilities and behavior. \n11 different characters, some of which contribute to puzzles as well as story development.",

    "summary": "The gameplay is very similar to the original Gauntlet, a topdown dungeon crawl supporting up to four players. The biggest difference from the original game is that players can choose identical classes, instead of being limited to a particular one for each joystick; each player is differentiated by color. Thus, instead of having a \"warrior\", \"wizard\", and \"valkyrie\" (for instance), in Gauntlet II there could be a \"red wizard\", a \"blue elf\" and a \"green warrior\".\n\nIn addition to the new \"class\" system, new level designs were added, including the possibility of encountering them in altered ways by having the play-field turned in steps of 90°. Other new features included the enemy \"It\", which upon contact would make a player \"It\" and draw all enemies towards him/her. The only way to release this curse is by touching another player or entering the exit, turning any level containing \"It\" into a fantasy filled game of tag. Other notable additions include the ability to ricochet shots off walls by means of a special pick-up, acid puddles that caused large, predetermined amounts of damage and a large dragon which would occupy multiple squares and require multiple hits to destroy.\n\nNew level elements were also added, adding more variety to the original game. These included \"all walls are invisible\", \"magic walls\" which changed into monsters or items when hit, \"stun tiles\" which stunned the player, and fake exits.\n\nAnother challenge in the game is the possibility to find a \"secret room\". This can be found by completing specific achievements within the level (e.g., \"don\u0027t be fooled\", means that you must find the real exit first). The secret room contains items such as food and magic potions (extra shot power, extra shot speed, extra magic power, extra speed, extra armor and extra fight power).\n\nThis sequel was also the first to feature what is now known as the Gauntlet theme tune, which resembles a simplified Baroque fugue.",

    "summary": "1830 is a railroad game set in the northeastern United States and southern Canada. You assume the identity of a railroad “Baron” and act as “President” of one or more Railroad Corporations. Your goal is to earn money. Money is earned mainly through owning shares of stock in the eight Railroad Corporations. Stock shares make money in two ways-they can provide ready cash via dividend payments, and they can increase in value. \n\nIf you’re the single largest stockholder in a Railroad Corporation, you become its President and operate its railroad, ideally, but not necessarily, for the benefit of all stockholders. The game ends when either: 1. A Baron goes bankrupt; or 2. The Bank runs out of money. The winner is the wealthiest Baron at game end.",

For example, launch an enemy into the air, wall jump to position yourself above them, then Katana Slam them into the ground. Switch to the Naginata and use the Naginata Lift and air dash moves to stay in the air and off crumbling platforms, while pulling enemies up to you to be dispatched in mid-air. Whip out your grappling hook to grapple between platforms, across chasms or fiery pits, all the while fending off enemies.\n\nEvery level is crammed full of environmental aids to help the player in combat encounters. Slice the support pillars off a building and watch it crush your enemies as it collapses, or use your moves to fling enemies into spikes, pits, or the path of moving deadly objects. Be careful though, as dropping a building on your own head is known to cause sadness!",

    "summary": "Tatakae!! Ramen-Man: Sakuretsu Choujin 102 Gei is an adventure game developed by Human Entertainment for the Famicom and published by Bandai in 1988. It is based off the Tatakae!! Ramenman series, which itself is a spin-off of the Kinnikuman series, known in the US as M.U.S.C.L.E.. Ramenman is a popular character in the Kinnikuman universe.\n\nThe game follows the eponymous warrior Ramenman as he attempts to track down his father\u0027s killers and bring them to justice with his many years of martial arts training. Notably, this game is the first true point-and-click adventure game for the system. While there had been many adventure games made for the NES, such as Portopia Renzoku Satsujin Jiken or Princess Tomato in the Salad Kingdom, they are largely driven by menus. Ramenman is directed by using the cursor to select an area to walk to or interact with instead much like classic Sierra adventure games such as King\u0027s Quest.",

The first player would play as a helicopter, but if a second player joins the game, they would play as a jeep. Both players would have to protect each other as well as themselves. After a certain number of kills, a \"goose\" helicopter would form on the screen. If the players managed to destroy it they would get a weapon\u0027s powerup. This would go on throughout the entire game, and a \"goose\" could appear even during the fight with the end-of-level baddie.",

You’ll have to use the various computer systems throughout the facility to gather information and aid you in your job. \n \nThe job gets dangerous when the facility is unexpectedly attacked by some hideous unknown creatures. Now the pressure is on as you try to repair the communications unit so you can call for the transport ship. Fortunately, the facility is equipped with auto-defense turrets, which you’ll have to manage wisely to keep the creatures from breaching the facility. You can also use the tank rover to easily dispatch of the creatures before they can get a chance to get through the walls. \n \nIf you\u0027re confident in your defenses you may even find a little time to go snooping around the facility while you\u0027re making your repairs and discover something interesting or useful. Depending on what you do during your assignment on Kepler 37-D, there are 9 possible endings that you can earn. Will you be happy with how it ends for you or will you try again for a better outcome?",
