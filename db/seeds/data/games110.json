This is how the list of candidates runs: there is a good programmer, an artist a bit scarce and a designer not bad; each of them, thanks to their skills, can give a more or less relevant hand in the realization of the project. Once everything is ready you must finally choose the kind and type of game to be realized, keeping in mind that some combinations will get married much better than others.\nIn Game Dev Story player can choose the platform on which to develop the project, and here things start to get very interesting. Game Dev Story in fact traces the last twenty years of the history of the video game industry, reproposing it in the form of an exhilarating parody: we start from the first computers, and then see almost all the major portable and home consoles announced. The names of companies, games and platforms have been revised, but are entirely traceable back to the originals; the Game Boy becomes the Game Kid and Microsoft is now Microx. However, in addition to the order in which the consoles are launched, the developers have chosen to keep even the success they have had at market level, which, on the one hand makes it even more pleasant to relive these twenty years from the inside , on the other hand, the player can easily predict big business and flop: nobody will be so crazy to develop a game for Virtual Boy (pardòn, Virtual Kid), while immediately supporting the fees of PlayStation and PlayStation 2 could lead to big boxing.\nThere are also annual awards, in which a jury rewards the best games of the year in the various categories. In the course of developing a project, however, the player will never remain with his hands: he will have to instruct his employees in order to cultivate their skills, buy the development kits of the various consoles, send announcements and look for new staff.\nIt is essential to keep the interest of the fans high, create hype and see the players line up days before the game, while sales can increase thanks to good reviews in specialized magazines. And yet, making a sequel to a successful game means starting the odds with good odds that the game sells, while the player can decide whether to invest everything in an ambitious project or make small titles in a very short time, until a budget has been reached. high enough to be able to make and place your console on the market.","tags":[28,268435468,268435469,268435471,268435488,268435491,536871906,536872060,536881499],"videos":[{"id":17494,"video_id":"DyC-JR6re-E"}]},{"id":29128,"cover":{"id":107539,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co2az7.jpg"},"name":"Drummer Talent VR","platforms":[{"id":6,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}],"screenshots":[{"id":65184,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/pawbmymz5cusnmmdh2ls.jpg"},{"id":65185,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/tw0mp5ncd2u5wdigsl4g.jpg"},{"id":65186,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/prmbzyfkvl8ojmouqgaz.jpg"},{"id":65187,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/aavt4ofls8xegpinprpc.jpg"},{"id":65188,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/kqwobrhnxtwjojycqqs3.jpg"}],"summary":"Drummer Talent VR is a drumming simulation VR music game.

For a mysterious reason, Gizarov chooses only one small town, called Gotaal. Immediately after having the town in his possession, Gizarov presses the population with heavy taxes. Landius, the son of Gotaal's mayor, fails to convince Gizarov to stop raising the taxes, and as a result, he has no other choice but to support the people in rebellion... \n \nThe game returns to the traditional gameplay style of the first two Langrisser games. You create your character and choose his class by answering questions in the beginning of the game (similar to Ultima games). Before the battles, you should recruit mercenaries, buy weapons and items, etc. Once in battle mode, you command several units led by stronger generals. Each unit has its own \"judgment\" ability\"; units with high judgment ability will perform more moves during a turn. \n \nThe story of Langrisser V is closely connected to the one told in Langrisser IV - the two games form a kind of a sub-series within the Langrisser universe. \n \nThe game's plot revolves around Sigma, an artificial human created by the great warlock and scientist Gizarov. One say, Sigma is awakened from his sleep inside a storage crystal in one of Gizarov's labs by Lambda, a girl who was also created by the scientist. Apparently, a powerful lord named Rainforce has invaded Gizarov's laboratory with the intention of destroying it. Meanwhile, a powerful artificial human called Omega, another \"child\" of Gizarov, distracts Rainforce. The two heroes flee to Regenburg, a country under Gizarov's rule, only to find out that they will soon have to stop a greater evil endangering the world - a new leader of darkness, who is after the powerful evil sword Alhazard... \n \nLangrisser V features classical Langrisser-style gameplay: you prepare your units before a battle, buy items etc., and in battle control various types of army units (archers, pikemen, etc.), together with the generals. The \"Judgment System\" from the previous game is back: your units can perform several moves per turn depending on their \"judgment level\". Like in Langrisser III, there is an element of \"love simulation\" in the game - at certain points you'll have to choose between various answers that will determine the further development of your relationship with the female party members.","tags":[268435468]},{"id":204,"cover":{"id":95226,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co21h6.jpg"},"name":"Secret Weapons of the Luftwaffe","platforms":[{"id":13,"name":"PC DOS"}],"screenshots":[{"id":17800,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/wazaiorjaqr0s6d7zh5w.jpg"},{"id":17801,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/lsbhsbfu1dnqqy6ut0aa.jpg"},{"id":17802,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/ycyawwqa5nuwp95s0o7a.jpg"},{"id":17803,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/ttksyr63a7st3uglkjbc.jpg"},{"id":17804,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/vz4zuft6xszp8t5aulvz.jpg"}],"summary":"After the success of the simulation titles Their Finest Hour: The Battle of Britain® and Battlehawks 1942 in the late 80s, LucasArts decided to follow up those games with another World War II simulation title: Secret Weapons of the Luftwaffe.

Players could fly in either American or German warplanes. The game was remarkable because many of the playable airplanes were still under development during the war. In other words, the planes were never used extensively in battle, so players could explore “what if ” possibilities with the game. Those possibilities were further expanded by four Tour of Duty expansion packs. The planes in those expansions included the P-38 Lighting, a twin-engine escort fighter and the German Do335, an interceptor aircraft that featured a conventional tractor propeller in the nose as well as a pusher propeller behind the tail of the aircraft.","tags":[1,22,39,268435469,268435471,536870931,536870948,536870968,536871904,536872060,536874694,536875137,536879130,536879625],"videos":[{"id":462,"video_id":"9eosVhMLr1A"}]},{"id":151723,"cover":{"id":151894,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co397a.jpg"},"name":"Rystel","platforms":[{"id":6,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}],"screenshots":[{"id":488237,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scagq5.jpg"},{"id":488238,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scagq6.jpg"},{"id":488239,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scagq7.jpg"}],"tags":[1,268435487,268435488,536871200],"videos":[{"id":50744,"video_id":"WPX6yIqSklw"}]},{"id":20438,"aggregated_rating":70.0,"cover":{"id":125070,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co2oi6.jpg"},"name":"Fable III: Traitor's Keep","platforms":[{"id":12,"name":"Xbox 360"}],"screenshots":[{"id":27451,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/shuxzxnyae9cjqoofvvg.jpg"}]},{"id":132475,"cover":{"id":116934,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co2i86.jpg"},"name":"Sayonara Electric","platforms":[{"id":6,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}],"screenshots":[{"id":403003,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc8myj.jpg"},{"id":403004,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc8myk.jpg"},{"id":403005,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc8myl.jpg"},{"id":403006,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc8mym.jpg"},{"id":403007,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc8myn.jpg"}],"summary":"This is an Interactive Adventure and Visual Novel Game depicting life on a lunar base.

Meanwhile, in the Shinra weapons lab, the Espgaluda project produced two successful prototypes: Agaha and Tateha. Fearing for their future, the project's head scientist, Hiodoshi, escaped with the two prototypes to a nearby kingdom, but time after were found by Shinra's troops and Hiodoshi was killed by the attack of the imperial army, the power of the galuda has awaken.\n\nYou have the option of controlling one of two siblings each with different skills, Ageha faster but with narrower shooting capabilities or Tateha slower but with a wider attack. As you fly through the various stages various mechanical enemies attack with a high number of bullets, often nearly filling the screen. Aside from the regular shots, Ageha and Tateha also have additional abilities which help the player navigate through the numerous bullets. The first is a guard barrier; when activated the player is immune to collisions and as a bonus when the barrier button is released a more powerful laser shot is fired. A meter at the bottom of the screen indicates how much power is left in the barrier. The second ability is called the Kakusei mode; when this mode is activated your character gender is altered and is able to fire a more powerful shot. More importantly, when this mode is activated all of the enemies and their bullets slow down considerably while the players speed remains the same making it easier to navigate through a tricky pattern of bullets. Activating Kakusei mode will rapidly deplete the players supply of green gems; since the number of gems isn't limitless the player may not be able to remain in Kakusei mode for long. When not in Kakusei mode additional gems can be collected by destroying the various enemies. If the player completely runs out of gems, enemy bullets begin travelling faster than usual.

After each season the manager has to have a certain amount of money on the club's account (how much depends on the chosen difficulty level) in order to avoid being fired.

The game features ten distinct types of challenge for players, all of which are simple to pick up and play using the Nintendo DS stylus, touch screen and microphone. Each of MinDStorm's challenges is designed to focus on enhancing the player's reason, endurance, analysis, intuition or observation. Regardless of the type of game chosen, extended play results in improved overall brain function and enhanced memory. \n \nA first for the brain training genre, MinDStorm throws additional challenges and problems into the mix. Players are rewarded with ever more complex riddles to solve as they do well in the main training mode. General knowledge and geography-based challenges are also included to accompany the more abstract trials such as sliding picture puzzles, mazes to navigate with the stylus and spot the difference games. \n \nFurther innovation is found in the way the game will adapt the tasks it asks players to perform according to the local environment it is being played in. When playing on a bumpy car or train ride for instance, MinDStorm will omit the tasks that require precise stylus action.

Also some settlements are ruled at certain times by independent rulers, e.g. Tortuga and Belize. These settlements can be attacked by the player, meaning his crew, with weapons the player chose, will land at the town and can then be controlled to burn and pillage it. Other than this the player controls a ship unit upon a map of the Spanish Main and can plot courses to pins which represent towns; however, if an NPC ship is close enough to the player (these ships spawn at the settlements with goals such as trade between towns or to find pirates), the player will be alerted and go into a smaller bird's-eye map in which they can raise flags to either enter diplomacy with the ship such as asking for information, raise nation flags to avoid them, or obviously raise the Jolly Roger to attack them. Ship combat is worked much as town combat with the player controlling his ship(s) with advanced controls such as where to aim cannon, and what type of shot, right down to scuttling the ship or setting it ablaze.","tags":[268435469,268435471,536871938,536872060,536874694]},{"id":133744,"cover":{"id":178439,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co3ton.jpg"},"name":"Nobody's Home","platforms":[{"id":6,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"},{"id":14,"name":"Mac"}],"screenshots":[{"id":625553,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scdeoh.jpg"},{"id":625554,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scdeoi.jpg"},{"id":625555,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scdeoj.jpg"}],"summary":"After a night of extreme drinking and partying, you wake up in a stranger's bed to discover...

The main style is Demolition. \n \nIn Demolition, you race against other cars around the track and get points for hitting them, spinning them in circles and knocking them into the wall. You also get a big bonus for landing on top of a car which will immediately destroy the car. When you finish the race, your final position is found by multiplying the points you got from hitting the other cars with the points that you got for the position you finished in.
