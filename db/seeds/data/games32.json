The design philosophy behind the title is simple -- rather than build the platformer around the main character, the software house opted instead to focus on the interactivity of the 3D environments he travels. To that end, Rocket employs an advanced physics engine which allows the main character, a lovable unicycle-based robot named Rocket, to travel and experiment with colorful, platform-esque worlds with realistic gravity and inertia. Every object has its own set of lifelike attributes that must be \"weighed\" into consideration when solving puzzles.","tags":[1,27,268435464,536870979,536871162,536871186,536871208,536871262,536871470,536871487,536872371,536872961,536873076,536874098,536874398,536874542,536874745,536875073,536875131,536875179,536875271,536875396,536875523,536875689,536875748,536875815,536875934,536876105,536876563,536877042,536878596,536879068,536897818]},{"id":66943,"cover":{"id":48440,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/purxvgqrzkksv3oytjit.jpg"},"name":"Hansel & Gretel","platforms":[{"id":8,"name":"PlayStation 2"}],"screenshots":[{"id":664941,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sce92l.jpg"},{"id":664942,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sce92m.jpg"},{"id":664943,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sce92n.jpg"},{"id":664944,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sce92o.jpg"},{"id":664945,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sce92p.jpg"}],"summary":"Hansel & Gretel is an Adventure game, developed by Aqua Pacific and published by Phoenix Games, which was released in Europe in 2006.\n\nIt is another of the Phoenix games that features a mix between watching a cartoon and a collection of sliding puzzles, jigsaw puzzles and colouring images.

The 18 teams and 35 drivers and their performance are based on the 1991 season, but the game doesn't include real names.

In-race setup allows players to adjust gear ratios, brake balance, wing downforce and tires during each visit to the pit box. Six optional driving aids help F1 rookies finish their race: players can toggle best line and suggested gear displays to learn track tactics, or have auto brakes, auto gears, self-righting spins and indestructibility to improve their driving. A replay system allows players to watch race scenes from three different views, including track-side camera footage. \n \nThe game features 3D graphics and various details and effects such as working rear mirrors, collisions with flying debris, crude damage models (wings are visibly bent after crashes), and wet weather that influences traction, including a fog effect that obscures vision when driving in another car's splash water. \n \nWhile the Amiga version allows multiplayer races in hotseat mode, the PC version originally had solo races only.

Parodius retains the selectability of different weapons configurations but implements via four different characters: Vic Viper (from Gradius), Octopus, Twin Bee, and Pentarou. The second main difference is the addition of bell power-ups, from the Twinbee series. These bells act as one-time power-ups, allowing you to destroy every enemy on screen, fire huge beams of energy, etc. Enemies and environments from the Gradius games and Twinbee are mixed in along, with a host of anime-style opponents, which include scantily-clad women. All of the Gradius elements are integrated in a very light-hearted fashion. The Big Core, a regular boss within the Gradius series, is given a neon-look and is called \"Viva Core\". Moreover, there is a moai (Easter Island head statues) level, but all of the statues are given a much more animated look. The boss of that level, the Moai Head, fires other moai at the player by spitting them out of her mouth. The final boss, in typical Gradius fashion, is an unarmed enemy that once defeated, results in a destruction/escape sequence.","tags":[1,27,268435461,268435489,536870990,536871078,536871208,536871262,536875056,536879161,536880906]},{"id":131847,"cover":{"id":95088,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co21dc.jpg"},"name":"Blade Runner: Enhanced Edition","platforms":[{"id":6,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"},{"id":48,"name":"PlayStation 4"},{"id":49,"name":"Xbox One"},{"id":130,"name":"Nintendo Switch"}],"summary":"Blade Runner is an adventure game with an emphasis on detective work rather than on puzzles.

Although the game's graphics looks a bit outdated in VGA, Fighters Kyodotai shines through in the gameplay department. \n \nTo begin with, there are dozens of characters to choose from, many from well-known Japanese manga/anime and video game series, including Doraemon, Dragonball Z, Pandora Crisis, and many more. Many fighters are original designs, and each fighter has plenty of unique and special attacks you can perform. The animations are excellent, and the controls intuitive. The computer players are very challenging - a lot of them will run up to you at lightning speed and perform 10+ hits combo before you can react. This may frustrate fighting game novices, although experts should welcome the chance to play a tough fanmade fighting game for once. The game is in Japanese, but it shouldn't be hard to figure out the controls If you enjoy beat'em ups, Fighters Kyodotai is a very well-made freeware old game that is well worth your time and the hefty download. Be warned of two minor weaknesses, though: the game doesn't let you change difficulty level or save key configurations.

It was released for free online in 2005 for Microsoft Windows. It was the senior game project of students attending DigiPen Institute of Technology. The gameplay consists of navigating a dungeon using an innovative portal system. The player controls a pair of interconnected portals that can be placed on any non-metallic surface (wall, ceiling, or floor). Gabe Newell, managing director of Valve Corporation, took interest in the team's work and employed the whole staff at Valve. The developers went on to make Portal (2007) using many of the same concepts.\n\nThe word Narbacular, which does not exist in any dictionary, was chosen primarily to aid in internet search engine results.\n\nBeing mostly a proof of applied concept, the game contains only six puzzles to solve. However, members of the Narbacular Drop forum community have created a catalog of custom maps.","tags":[1,17,22,268435461,268435464,268435465,536871063,536871208,536871506,536871878,536872287,536872334,536872441,536872885,536873095,536873249,536873362,536873671,536873787,536873904,536875057,536875151,536875208,536875242,536875244,536875271,536875316,536875437,536875606,536875667,536875670,536875690,536875760,536875768,536876011,536876205,536877626,536877960,536882290],"videos":[{"id":14175,"video_id":"oGEQ17Kr8xQ"}]},{"id":91294,"name":"Red Bull Doodle Art - Global VR Gallery","platforms":[{"id":6,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}],"screenshots":[{"id":201901,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/vidnmwu6anrz7l4gtr3x.jpg"},{"id":201902,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/pyqaeoi769mgi2ztzb51.jpg"},{"id":201903,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/o7kztmiu1v6dw63znvv9.jpg"},{"id":201904,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/cywwpfm610fk3pjychc2.jpg"},{"id":201905,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/bcqc0op3kao181qayytx.jpg"}],"summary":"Where does the mind take you?\n\nIn June 2017 the best doodlers from around the world were invited for the global finals of Red Bull Doodle Art, in San Francisco, where they could take doodling to the next dimension, literally.\n\nThe resulting VR artworks were combined into the Global VR Gallery.","tags":[268435469,268435487]},{"id":112842,"cover":{"id":103894,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co285y.jpg"},"name":"Space Captain McCallery Episode 2: Pilgrims in Purple Moss","platforms":[{"id":6,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"},{"id":14,"name":"Mac"}],"screenshots":[{"id":274649,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc5vx5.jpg"},{"id":274650,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc5vx6.jpg"},{"id":274651,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc5vx7.jpg"},{"id":274652,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc5vx8.jpg"},{"id":274653,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc5vx9.jpg"}],"summary":"Space Pirate Captain McCallery explores a mysterious ruin in an alien swamp in search of treasure in this Low-Poly 3D Action-Adventure game.","tags":[1,268435487,268435488],"videos":[{"id":36498,"video_id":"0xNmz9B4Bso"}]},{"id":13561,"aggregated_rating":70.9,"cover":{"id":99770,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co24ze.jpg"},"name":"Digimon World: Next Order","platforms":[{"id":46,"name":"PlayStation Vita"},{"id":48,"name":"PlayStation 4"}],"screenshots":[{"id":15373,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/c9jlcciq5f6u4pfibyr1.jpg"},{"id":15374,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/s0lmn1m4dqdzl91zlezb.jpg"},{"id":15375,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/phsmffjgolmzb1rbtswf.jpg"},{"id":15376,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/bax62gilfbcmejibgg8l.jpg"},{"id":15377,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/bd16covd2v7j2dobs2oj.jpg"}],"summary":"Digimon World: Next Order is an upcoming Digimon role-playing game.

SWAT teams, gun-toting elderly, helicopter gunships, pandas, pugs and suicidal samurais stand between you and election victory. \n \nNOT A HERO: SUPER SNAZZY EDITION introduces the “ME, MYSELF & BUNNYLORD” Campaign, letting you play as the BunnyLord himself!

Jackson, reprising their roles from the film.","tags":[1,18,268435461,268435487]},{"id":90069,"name":"Fantasy World: A Land Torn Asunder","platforms":[{"id":6,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"},{"id":14,"name":"Mac"}],"screenshots":[{"id":198182,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/kl0ldjhpg9zqw4llu7lp.jpg"},{"id":198183,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/elvv6o3cw7wquipdidyi.jpg"},{"id":198184,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/n7d1cqtj6m5fsashqcg8.jpg"},{"id":198185,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/d0mnvwxx9ibznthppgjq.jpg"},{"id":198186,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/pfrtqi2xzettpxazwmin.jpg"},{"id":198187,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/qaz5hsappgifwlnigplr.jpg"},{"id":198188,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/cnntan9khjju1gcvkyqy.jpg"},{"id":198189,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/q24halxhklopqfpuyaj6.jpg"},{"id":198190,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/tpmm0f5di5lmkfh1invt.jpg"},{"id":198191,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/aubjfbbti0mhnvxxxofp.jpg"},{"id":198192,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/xisyulqjgxwke5tohxqe.jpg"},{"id":198193,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/mhpizqkxhrchqkl5jsem.jpg"}],"summary":"CLASSIC ROLEPLAYING REIMAGINED Embark on an epic open-world adventure, in which you must unite the survivors of a fantastical apocalypse and strike back against the greatest evil the world has ever known.","tags":[268435468,268435488]},{"id":130255,"cover":{"id":121941,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co2m39.jpg"},"name":"Vigil of Glory - Part I","platforms":[{"id":6,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}],"screenshots":[{"id":382286,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc86z2.jpg"},{"id":382287,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc86z3.jpg"},{"id":382288,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc86z4.jpg"},{"id":382289,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc86z5.jpg"},{"id":382290,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc86z6.jpg"},{"id":382291,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc86z7.jpg"}],"summary":"Are you even to yourself?
