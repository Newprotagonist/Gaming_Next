Some have written that at last it is possible to interpret the tales of the Avatar as they should be, with the proper historical perspective. Some argue that as time moves on, the truth of what actually occurred will fade even further away and that we have a responsibility to preserve the legends as we now know them. However, most agree when it comes to a number of basic theories.\n\nWhile there are those who maintain that the stories of the Avatar are only myths, practically all credible scholars say that at least some elements of the Avatar’s tales are historical fact. In reality, one need look no further than the Isle of the Avatar to see very persuasive evidence that the Avatar did indeed exist - at least as a person if not as a spiritual being!\nIt is most likely that there has been more than one Avatar. All of the writings insist that the Avatar who negotiated the peace between Britannia and the gargoyles is the one and same person who first appeared to vanquish the sorcerer Mondain those many years ago. While saying it is most unlikely, historians do not firmly deny the possibility of there having been only on Avatar. After all, our good sovereign monarch, wise Lord British, has himself displayed an amazing longevity!\n\nWhatever interpretation of history proves to be most accurate, it seems undeniable that the Avatar will not return to our fair kingdom. By all indications the age of magic is coming to an end. With the decline on reliability of mages, and with the kingdom turning away from the magical arts, it is doubtful that extreme danger - that which would require an Avatar’s aid to defeat it - will ever return to Britannia. And thankfully so.\n\nUpon us is the age of The Fellowship, in which one does not simply wait in anticipation for a heroic savior when a crisis occurs. In this less spectacular but more practical day, we are left to solve our problems with our own minds and our own will.","tags":[17,268435468,268435487,536871138,536871139,536871208,536871213,536871470,536871938,536871939,536872120,536872371,536872435,536872898,536872983,536873066,536873364,536875196,536875214,536875265,536875361,536875455,536875531,536875791,536876007,536876326,536876476,536876592,536877150,536878447,536880693,536880854]},{"id":15497,"cover":{"id":13556,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/jist0ptrifkas7ccgwco.jpg"},"name":"Time and Magik: The Trilogy","platforms":[{"id":13,"name":"PC DOS"},{"id":14,"name":"Mac"},{"id":15,"name":"Commodore C64/128"},{"id":16,"name":"Amiga"},{"id":25,"name":"Amstrad CPC"},{"id":26,"name":"ZX Spectrum"},{"id":27,"name":"MSX"},{"id":63,"name":"Atari ST/STE"},{"id":65,"name":"Atari 8-bit"},{"id":69,"name":"BBC Microcomputer System"}],"summary":"This is a trilogy of adventures set in the world of time travel and magic.","tags":[17,268435487,536871130,536871939]},{"id":1298,"aggregated_rating":74.6,"cover":{"id":91355,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co1yhn.jpg"},"name":"Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon 2","platforms":[{"id":8,"name":"PlayStation 2"},{"id":11,"name":"Xbox"},{"id":21,"name":"Nintendo GameCube"}],"screenshots":[{"id":1792,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/ittwgtc5ryed7gpcf4sm.jpg"},{"id":1793,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/pgi9iscf5gyzlozax4p3.jpg"},{"id":1794,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/hgfwswseltcmeuvqby4f.jpg"},{"id":1795,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/kzup1jcikoi09nvwfrkn.jpg"},{"id":1796,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/vdhlo19ew0de7pkhkr9p.jpg"}],"summary":"Set in the near future, Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon 2 puts the player in the shoes of a highly trained operative who works as a part of the infamous military unit from the U.S. Special Forces only known as \"Ghosts\". \n \nThe game is set in North Korea, where an evil general is diverting all the humanitarian aid to boost his forces and gain more political power in the process and it's up to Ghosts to eliminate this threat. \n \nThere is a single player campaign mode, where the player as part of the Ghosts, must take on the evil general in 11 different and quite long missions.

It's now possible to completely design your own campaign using the editor, including importing new item, tile and monster pics.\nA Bag of Holding has been implemented - characters can now carry twice as much once they have purchased the bag.\nThere are also 'super' monsters: 3x3 tiles in size!","tags":[17,268435465,268435468,268435487]},{"id":36530,"cover":{"id":102605,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co2765.jpg"},"name":"Steambirds Alliance","platforms":[{"id":6,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"},{"id":14,"name":"Mac"}],"screenshots":[{"id":58862,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/hzysle7xxu1evnrzbaqt.jpg"},{"id":58863,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/d2szolswi4weczvjubxe.jpg"},{"id":58864,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/suspcur0txrbbvevg0sv.jpg"},{"id":58865,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/rfmucj6bw4yfdfwz8dou.jpg"},{"id":58866,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/uzijqc4pytszoesgscyw.jpg"}],"summary":"Steambirds Alliance is a massively-cooperative bullet-hell shooter!

FFXI was the world's first cross-console MMORPG, available for Windows, PlayStation 2, Xbox 360 and Steam.\n\nSince its release in 2002, it has become the most financially successful title in the Final Fantasy series. Due to the nature of online RPGs, FFXI differs in that the player is not the only hero. Instead, each player creates a customizable character and adventures through the world of Vana'diel with other players; leveling up, exploring, completing missions, quests, and much more.\n\nLeveling up requires a group of people working together in what is called a Party, with each participant contributing their own skills to help take down a foe and gain Experience points. Battles occur in real-time, taking the ATB system to a new level, which was emulated again to a certain extent in Final Fantasy XII.","tags":[1,17,268435468,268435487,536870988,536870999,536871105,536871138,536871139,536871148,536871208,536871213,536871283,536871327,536871409,536871470,536871473,536871504,536871758,536871812,536871818,536872070,536872205,536872245,536872339,536872352,536872371,536872435,536872594,536872611,536872647,536872733,536872828,536873023,536873092,536873364,536873580,536873591,536873718,536873904,536873906,536874040,536874398,536874743,536874745,536874831,536875073,536875074,536875158,536875161,536875169,536875173,536875184,536875196,536875232,536875233,536875242,536875262,536875265,536875271,536875300,536875304,536875311,536875316,536875317,536875327,536875330,536875331,536875356,536875358,536875362,536875372,536875373,536875380,536875405,536875420,536875426,536875437,536875453,536875455,536875464,536875478,536875488,536875523,536875525,536875527,536875537,536875586,536875608,536875614,536875639,536875671,536875735,536875738,536875745,536875752,536875764,536875770,536875778,536875781,536875790,536875791,536875798,536875803,536875822,536875830,536875855,536875874,536875896,536875952,536876007,536876027,536876232,536876235,536876285,536876286,536876376,536876511,536876546,536876569,536876590,536876598,536876606,536876614,536876706,536876707,536876718,536876736,536876816,536876826,536876847,536876877,536876927,536876967,536876973,536877003,536877133,536877167,536877172,536877204,536877208,536877209,536877210,536877216,536877220,536877237,536877308,536877422,536877423,536877453,536877508,536877628,536877696,536877724,536877766,536877767,536877768,536877770,536877892,536877907,536877984,536878216,536878335,536878373,536878440,536878441,536878444,536878446,536879108,536879132,536879696,536879765,536879891,536879941,536879942,536879976,536880004,536880234,536880294,536880363,536880421,536880431,536880469,536880540,536880542,536880624,536880706,536880753,536880755,536880803,536880833,536880960,536881122,536881260,536881350,536881367,536881416,536881456,536881470,536881768,536882362,536882365,536882496,536882688,536882819,536882865,536883028,536883155,536883271,536883336,536883637,536883639,536884018,536884021,536884027,536884029,536884600,536885058,536885147,536885277,536885278,536885311,536885312,536885313,536885314,536885315,536885316,536885317,536885383,536885384,536885813,536886249,536886250,536886713,536899580],"videos":[{"id":325,"video_id":"EBHArAqP-iQ"}]},{"id":116077,"aggregated_rating":75.0,"cover":{"id":117505,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co2io1.jpg"},"name":"Stacks On Stacks (On Stacks)","platforms":[{"id":130,"name":"Nintendo Switch"},{"id":170,"name":"Google Stadia"}],"screenshots":[{"id":296010,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc6cei.jpg"},{"id":296011,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc6cej.jpg"},{"id":296012,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc6cek.jpg"},{"id":296013,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc6cel.jpg"},{"id":296014,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc6cem.jpg"}],"summary":"Stacks On Stacks (On Stacks) is a zany 3D tower builder.

After each successful encounter, the party is rewarded with experience points, often accompanied by gold and items useful to its journey. Once characters have enough experience points, they advance in level, increasing such abilities as attack strength, defense, agility (ability to evade attacks), prowess (ability to strike hits) and speed (how often they can attack).","tags":[1,17,268435487],"videos":[{"id":65965,"video_id":"uIcf7ZtJ0D4"},{"id":65966,"video_id":"uIcf7ZtJ0D4"}]},{"id":32839,"cover":{"id":109252,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co2cas.jpg"},"name":"SWARMRIDERS","platforms":[{"id":3,"name":"Linux"},{"id":6,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"},{"id":130,"name":"Nintendo Switch"}],"screenshots":[{"id":53700,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/fu2okfo0xmwhazvvqvzs.jpg"},{"id":53701,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/huaurkfdyttqpmvmehtx.jpg"},{"id":53702,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sjfpe2mzmzxbvrgldhvh.jpg"},{"id":53703,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/ydtdtl4ipmzhhpltmmqp.jpg"},{"id":53704,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/tu3b3gv34wehq1b8onqn.jpg"}],"summary":"SWARMRIDERS is a FREE \"endless runner\"+\"twin stick shooter\" ARCADE mashup.

It was released for the Xbox on November 3, 2003 and for Microsoft Windows PC systems on June 14, 2004. The game stars Drake, an undead assassin who is on a quest to avenge his murdered clan, the 99 Dragons, by recovering their ancient \"Soul Portal Artifact\" from antagonist Tang. Tang intends on using the artifact to harvest the souls of dead beings and power his undead cyborg army.\n\nIdol FX intended for Drake of the 99 Dragons to be the launchpad for a multimedia franchise, which would include comics and a potential animated television series. However, the contract they signed with Majesco gave them a mere six months for development, leaving little room for play-testing and resulting in the game being unfinished. As a result, it is often considered to be one of the worst games of all-time.","tags":[1,19,268435461,536870934,536871208,536871379,536871382,536871417,536871738,536871809,536871937,536872032,536872107,536872221,536872232,536875358,536875437,536875805,536876243,536876509,536877628,536881123,536881534,536884207]},{"id":150174,"cover":{"id":187500,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co40oc.jpg"},"name":"Reverse Defenders","platforms":[{"id":6,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}],"screenshots":[{"id":475430,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sca6ue.jpg"},{"id":475437,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sca6ul.jpg"},{"id":475443,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sca6ur.jpg"},{"id":475451,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sca6uz.jpg"},{"id":475456,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sca6v4.jpg"}],"summary":"An addictive tower defense game is here!

The P.R.L. 412 was significantly upgraded and now shoots several beams instead of just one. The Wii version also supports the Wii's Classic Controller, which reverts aiming and the laser sight back to the original format. The only other noticeable differences are that the game seems significantly easier, and that all of Leon's actions appear to move slightly faster.","tags":[1,19,21,268435461,268435487]},{"id":14565,"cover":{"id":97951,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co23kv.jpg"},"name":"Card City Nights","platforms":[{"id":3,"name":"Linux"},{"id":6,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"},{"id":14,"name":"Mac"},{"id":34,"name":"Android"},{"id":39,"name":"iOS"}],"screenshots":[{"id":36138,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sexkcbtgufk7cxxncpmo.jpg"},{"id":36139,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/rjsdowphwu8zposqc0fk.jpg"},{"id":36140,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/ywugtgiuoizcghqth3tn.jpg"},{"id":36141,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/lkabvderqbsgud2wtukc.jpg"},{"id":36142,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/bvydriasb4xuff5evjoz.jpg"}],"summary":"Card City Nights is an adventure through a city filled with card-nuts and lunatics.

Often, players will come to a \"decision point\" where they are given the chance to choose from options displayed on the screen, typically two to three at a time. There are three main plot lines that the player will have the chance to experience, one for each of the heroines in the story. To view all three plot lines, the player will have to replay the game multiple times and choose different choices during the decision points to progress the plot in an alternate direction.","tags":[17,42,268435487,268435490,536871138,536871759,536872225,536872873,536874498,536874737,536876054],"videos":[{"id":5435,"video_id":"_RDVoPeK3Rc"}]},{"id":143751,"cover":{"id":131843,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co2tqb.jpg"},"name":"Pixeline: Syng, leg og lær","platforms":[{"id":6,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}],"summary":"Pixeline: Syng, leg og lær is the first game in the Pixeline series.
