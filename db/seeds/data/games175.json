The game is a point-and-click adventure game which sees the player traveling around a virtual representation of the RMS Titanic.\nTitanic: Adventure Out of Time comes in three versions: a PC, Macintosh, or hybrid version that works on both the Windows and Mac. Version 1.0 of the game is an upgrade of the game from GTE Entertainment to just Cyberflix and is a stability upgrade first released in 1997. It comes in either a threefold CD jacket or a jewel case version. The French and German version of the game comes in two paper sleeves. The Mac and Windows versions were released first, produced by Cyberflix and distributed by GTE Entertainment in 1996. Hybrid versions of the game, which are compatible with both the Mac and Windows operating systems, were distributed and produced by Cyberflix after GTE Entertainment went out of business in 1997. Later versions were distributed by Hammerhead Entertainment, who took over production after Cyberflix also went out of business in 1998. The game is available in seven languages: English, French, German, Dutch, Russian, Polish and Korean.\nCharacters in Titanic: Adventure Out of Time were rendered by way of photographs of actors given limited animation in sync with dialogue.

Each player picks a character class, such as engineer, soldier, field ops, or covert ops, and then makes use of that class's special abilities, class-specific weapons, and inventory items.","tags":[1,22,39,268435461,536870914,536870931,536871041,536871188,536871336,536871365,536871378,536871456,536871470,536871475,536871937,536872245,536872287,536872733,536872882,536873999,536874743,536875046,536875095,536875097,536875137,536875191,536875303,536875314,536875358,536875420,536875455,536875492,536875642,536875693,536875738,536875803,536875810,536876262,536876367,536876395,536876499,536876503,536876521,536876564,536876586,536876644,536876662,536876665,536876687,536877210,536877211,536877220,536877231,536877241,536877264,536877433,536877537,536877628,536877928,536877938,536877961,536878002,536878025,536878317,536878582,536879605,536879607,536879871,536879888,536880210,536880442,536881514,536881525,536882400,536883035,536883629,536886145,536887058],"videos":[{"id":1534,"video_id":"2d3glwfiin0"},{"id":34427,"video_id":"FJ9kYLnKto8"}]},{"id":54,"cover":{"id":91179,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co1ycr.jpg"},"name":"An Elder Scrolls Legend: Battlespire","platforms":[{"id":13,"name":"PC DOS"}],"screenshots":[{"id":784930,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scgtnm.jpg"},{"id":784933,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scgtnp.jpg"},{"id":784935,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scgtnr.jpg"},{"id":784937,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scgtnt.jpg"},{"id":784939,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scgtnv.jpg"},{"id":784940,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scgtnw.jpg"},{"id":784942,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scgtny.jpg"},{"id":784944,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scgto0.jpg"},{"id":784946,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scgto2.jpg"},{"id":784949,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scgto5.jpg"}],"summary":"An Elder Scrolls Legend: Battlespire is an action role-playing open world video game developed and published by Bethesda Softworks, set in the world of The Elder Scrolls.","tags":[1,17,268435468,536870928,536870934,536871086,536871138,536871208,536871470,536871938,536872232,536872594,536872647,536872798,536872873,536873384,536873473,536873718,536875042,536875184,536875196,536875263,536875281,536875306,536875319,536875445,536875464,536875610,536875614,536875677,536875735,536875738,536875775,536875778,536875803,536875831,536875891,536876007,536876010,536876036,536876059,536876060,536876233,536876528,536876539,536876560,536876601,536876607,536876612,536876706,536876882,536878045,536878072,536878073,536878360,536878373,536878391,536878522,536878525,536878530,536878533,536879059,536880386,536880562,536880907,536880932,536881235,536882279,536882283,536882816,536882862,536883213,536883962,536885929,536885954,536885956,536885960,536886892]},{"id":52,"aggregated_rating":88.0,"cover":{"id":120072,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co2knc.jpg"},"name":"The Elder Scrolls: Arena","platforms":[{"id":6,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"},{"id":13,"name":"PC DOS"}],"screenshots":[{"id":111795,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/yj69aorqgttrkhpwb9lt.jpg"},{"id":111796,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/rutf2boafwqrcatawlia.jpg"},{"id":111797,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/tzd3gwbawd7qekueodbh.jpg"},{"id":111798,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/q5rl1jsc4euqdsglltyq.jpg"}],"summary":"The Elder Scrolls - Arena is the first RPG fantasy game of the Elder Scrolls series.\nThe game takes place on a planet called Nirn in the empire of Tamriel.

The plot of the game picks up where The Legacy of Goku left off, and continues until the end of the Cell Games Saga when Gohan defeats the evil android Cell. The game introduced several new concepts to the series. The first was transformations, which allowed characters to become temporarily stronger, at the cost of slowly draining their energy. It also introduced the scouter, which allowed players to look up the stats of other characters in the game, as well as basic information about them. The game also introduced charged melee attacks, which allowed characters to unleash a powerful physical strike after a short charging period. The game also allowed characters to further supplement their stats with capsules that were scattered around the game world. Despite being titled \"The Legacy of Goku\" this game featured the most limited play as the character Goku.\n\nDue to the game's success, a second version was released titled Dragon Ball Z: The Legacy of Goku II International exclusive to Japan on July 23, 2004. In this version all characters were given new profile images and their names were reverted to their original Japanese. However, Mister Satan still retains his English name \"Hercule\" on the front of his parade float.\n\n[Source] - Wikipedia.","tags":[1,268435468,268435487,536870926,536870990,536871213,536871859,536871872,536871938,536872983,536873299,536873314,536873393,536873394,536875053,536875054,536875151,536875180,536875258,536875803,536875881,536875934,536876241,536877000,536877002,536877005,536877018,536878458,536879681,536879757,536879765,536880286,536880918,536881604,536883356,536884027,536884505]},{"id":146180,"cover":{"id":218958,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co4oy6.jpg"},"name":"Dairoku: Agents Of Sakuratani","platforms":[{"id":130,"name":"Nintendo Switch"}],"screenshots":[{"id":551961,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scbtw9.jpg"},{"id":551962,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scbtwa.jpg"},{"id":551963,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scbtwb.jpg"},{"id":551964,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scbtwc.jpg"},{"id":551965,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scbtwd.jpg"}],"summary":"Ever since she could remember, Akitsu Shino has had the ability to see what others could not: spirits, apparitions, and indescribable creatures.

The story acts as a prequel to the original Vandal Hearts. \n \nThe series' trademark isometric combat returns, now presented in 3-D with 3-D character models. Players attempt to position themselves tactically to gain an advantage over stronger (or more numerous) foes. Combat takes place in turns, with each side moving one character per turn. Each party member can carry two weapons and switch between them without using up a \"turn,\" allowing them to shift quickly from a sword to a long-range bow, for example. Characters gain levels through successful battles, and increase skills with a particular weapon or spell by using that weapon or spell in combat. \n \nMany engagements expand beyond simple combat by introducing some sort of puzzle element, ranging from pushing boulders to protecting characters from attackers. Missions may also radically update their goals as progress is made.

Many gameplay elements are similar to the Age of Empires series. Its campaign follows an Atlantean admiral, Arkantos, who is forced to travel through the lands of the game's three cultures, hunting for a cyclops who is in league with Poseidon against Atlantis. \n \nAge of Mythology was commercially successful, going platinum four months after its release after selling over one million units.

The player chooses a character, either Moorhuhn itself or Lesshuhn, Snowman or Pumpkinhead. The game's objective is to win the race, of course, but your opponent will try everything in their power to keep your chosen character from winning by sending you off the racetrack. To achieve this they resort to things like weights, water bombs, chewing gum, boards larded with nails or even rockets. But the player can also find these so called power-ups, small packages that can be found at random order on the racetrack. Unfortunately, you do not know what is in the packages until they are opened which adds a little surprise to the action.\n\nThe kart is controlled using the arrow keys on the keyboard, but one can also use a Windows compatible gamepad.\n\nThe XL version lacks the Duel mode and two courses.","tags":[268435466]},{"id":23238,"cover":{"id":187042,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co40bm.jpg"},"name":"WWF In Your House","platforms":[{"id":7,"name":"PlayStation"},{"id":13,"name":"PC DOS"},{"id":32,"name":"Sega Saturn"}],"summary":"WWF In Your House is a successor to WWF WrestleMania: The Arcade Game.

You also have to connect all the little villages in the province with roads and make some industry, like stone mining, grapes, etc. for which you can then create markets in your city.","tags":[22,28,268435471,536871205]},{"id":3481,"cover":{"id":104026,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co289m.jpg"},"name":"Earthworm Jim 2","platforms":[{"id":5,"name":"Wii"},{"id":6,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"},{"id":7,"name":"PlayStation"},{"id":19,"name":"Super Nintendo Entertainment System (SNES)"},{"id":24,"name":"Game Boy Advance"},{"id":29,"name":"Sega Mega Drive/Genesis"},{"id":32,"name":"Sega Saturn"}],"screenshots":[{"id":104533,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/zhbqllbx7c8unhymtz4t.jpg"},{"id":104534,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/i0qpjdgkdg5hhlnubpgr.jpg"},{"id":104535,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/vvzsjn9n2oaqvokfb8f5.jpg"},{"id":104536,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/hlsesbbtrmmelyk5r9r2.jpg"},{"id":104537,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/jdf2fom71ww6xomhbhsx.jpg"},{"id":157658,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/upk4rxdlfeuvxquzisid.jpg"},{"id":157659,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/vcjif99spcymink0fjzi.jpg"},{"id":157660,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/n5glcf3qc3uyxut8zcpu.jpg"},{"id":157661,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/nlywbrqlfx3paijjh9hc.jpg"},{"id":157662,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/ouq533wsjagftgikduil.jpg"},{"id":157663,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/ccdy4e110wbx37s3ybrm.jpg"},{"id":157664,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/shtdpmxcg9cnmgwtlboq.jpg"}],"summary":"From Evil the Cat’s’Circus of the Scars’ to the planet of Meat, join Jim on a madcap chase across the galaxy.

With the Nintendo GameCube Microphone, players direct their soldiers out of the Odama's way and into the fray by charging the enemy, defending positions and seizing the enemy gates.","tags":[1,17,22,268435467,268435471,268435486,536871595,536871846,536872383,536872583,536874694,536875067,536875412,536875751,536876100,536876102,536876720,536884021,536884022,536886400]},{"id":999,"aggregated_rating":100.0,"cover":{"id":91026,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co1y8i.jpg"},"name":"Oddworld: Abe's Oddysee","platforms":[{"id":6,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"},{"id":7,"name":"PlayStation"},{"id":9,"name":"PlayStation 3"},{"id":13,"name":"PC DOS"},{"id":38,"name":"PlayStation Portable"},{"id":46,"name":"PlayStation Vita"}],"screenshots":[{"id":552137,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scbu15.jpg"},{"id":552138,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scbu16.jpg"},{"id":552139,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scbu17.jpg"},{"id":552140,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scbu18.jpg"},{"id":552141,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scbu19.jpg"},{"id":552142,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scbu1a.jpg"}],"summary":"Oddworld: Abe's Oddysee is the first game set in the fictional Oddworld universe. It is a platformer with puzzle-solving elements, focusing on the portrayal of a weak, underpowered character in a grim and hostile world, who has to rely on his cunning to outwit enemies and overcome hazards. The game has pre-rendered background graphics and uses CG movies of similar style to advance the story between the levels.\n\nThe main character Abe is almost completely helpless: he cannot use weapons and is usually instantly killed by his brutal enemies if he confronts them directly. For this reason, most of the game involves careful exploration, timed movement, sneaking, and outsmarting the foes through various means: throwing stones to confuse them, luring them into traps, etc. Abe can run, jump, climb, tiptoe, crouch, and roll; in most areas these actions are essential to his survival. A few stages involve Abe riding a large animal known as Elum.\n\nAbe's only special power is chanting, which he can use to stun certain enemies for a while or possess them. When Abe possess an enemy he gains his abilities: for example, possessing the body or a ferocious Slig allows the player to shoot from his machine gun, communicate with other creatures of his kind, and even commit suicide, clearing the way for Abe.","tags":[1,18,27,268435464,268435465,268435487,536870984,536871015,536871044,536871208,536871262,536871470,536871501,536871506,536871878,536871882,536871945,536871971,536872070,536872225,536872257,536872419,536872666,536872798,536872961,536873455,536873787,536873914,536873973,536874098,536874115,536874706,536874743,536874947,536875046,536875050,536875073,536875074,536875152,536875170,536875199,536875200,536875210,536875262,536875264,536875284,536875301,536875305,536875310,536875330,536875358,536875393,536875453,536875488,536875491,536875493,536875523,536875531,536875532,536875623,536875638,536875688,536875691,536875769,536875792,536875802,536875806,536875816,536875874,536876008,536876012,536876021,536876028,536876122,536876242,536876317,536876413,536876418,536876445,536876473,536876559,536876572,536876712,536876726,536876862,536876886,536877253,536877277,536877305,536877308,536877551,536877582,536877583,536877643,536877760,536877762,536877971,536878002,536878017,536878217,536878470,536878567,536879013,536879072,536879148,536879691,536880256,536880294,536880324,536880371,536880441,536880868,536880869,536880870,536882964,536883035,536883622,536884033,536884863,536885056,536886134,536886135],"videos":[{"id":4688,"video_id":"bLT-hCj8bTA"},{"id":4689,"video_id":"jWCrg3jGCk8"}]},{"id":1002,"aggregated_rating":78.0,"cover":{"id":161785,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co3gu1.jpg"},"name":"Oddworld: Stranger's Wrath","platforms":[{"id":6,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"},{"id":11,"name":"Xbox"},{"id":34,"name":"Android"},{"id":39,"name":"iOS"},{"id":72,"name":"Ouya"}],"screenshots":[{"id":11073,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/fulsj8bmexmyztvbuvnm.jpg"},{"id":11074,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/ze1ljfmvj6ulgeffvkju.jpg"},{"id":11075,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/wbzykbs8achoucxtt50k.jpg"}],"summary":"Prepare to immerse yourself in 20 + hours of action-adventure.\n\nIn the dusty, undeveloped wastelands of Western Mudos, cantankerous townsfolk find their settlements besieged by belligerent outlaws.

Pac-Man's directions are chosen at random between left or right, but as he goes moving on in the game area (after you place him, of course), if he bumps against a block or the \"walls\" of the game area, he will change his direction.\n\nAs Pac-Man eats ghosts and clear rows of blocks, the level increases, which affects the speed and gravity of the pieces one places, as well as the amount of pieces placed before Pac-Man will appear. If one is unable to fit the bottom two parts of a piece into a legal zone of the playing area, the game ends. However, by filling up a meter on the left of the screen via eating ghosts, a fairy will be summoned in place of Pac-Man. She can fit into any empty space, and can clear up to 7 rows of ghosts; all blocks that were on top of cleared ghosts will drop down accordingly.\n\nThe game also includes a Puzzle mode. It features 100 levels, in which you have to eat all ghosts with no more than 4 Pac-Men at least (the number reduces in certain levels), and, unlike the other modes, you can change Pac-Man's direction with the press of a button.","tags":[268435465]},{"id":124290,"cover":{"id":123437,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co2n8t.jpg"},"name":"VeggieTales: The Mystery of Veggie Island","platforms":[{"id":6,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}],"tags":[17,268435458,268435487,536872216,536877210,536895350]},{"id":16001,"aggregated_rating":80.0,"cover":{"id":84309,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co1t1x.jpg"},"name":"Nancy Drew: The Creature of Kapu Cave","platforms":[{"id":6,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}],"screenshots":[{"id":45189,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/lbcjtggbt8aeuxmordwl.jpg"},{"id":45190,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/vvqq5twd0o3brjrzhk0e.jpg"},{"id":45191,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/xswitw6qyrsibi40egqi.jpg"},{"id":45192,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/pxkwlf6roe7mwmdvblrn.jpg"},{"id":45193,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/jn1ddcxrfqylkc7jyjfc.jpg"}],"summary":"Nancy Drew: The Creature of Kapu Cave is a first-person perspective, point-and-click adventure game.

In each section there are some playable minigames. Playing the minigames costs a few tokens. Jamie starts the player off with ten tokens. Winning the minigames earns the player additional tokens depending on the winning score. At least one minigame in each fairground section earns the player a special coin.

One of the best things about MAJOR LEAGUE BASEBALL 2K5 WORLD SERIES EDITION that sets it apart from the regular baseball titles is the way that the designers have incorporated a new Pennant Fever mode as well as the World Series Championship Moments mode that allow players to experience the game of baseball from a new and exciting standpoint. In Pennant Fever mode players will get to play through the final games of the season from the basic franchise mode. Thus giving them the chance to only play through the excitement and frantic play that often encapsulates the last few games of the season. The Championship Moments mode, on the other hand is a little different in that it lets fans play through some of the greatest World Series moments throughout history in a type of simulation. This allows players to get directly on the inside of some of the games that changed the way America viewed baseball. The MAJOR LEAGUE BASEBALL 2K5 WORLD SERIES EDITION is essentially the same great MLB game that comes out every year with a few bonus features, but those bonuses are well worth the money as they will easily pay for themselves with the hours of fun game play.","tags":[268435470]},{"id":169,"aggregated_rating":84.0,"cover":{"id":106711,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co2ac7.jpg"},"name":"Star Wars: X-Wing Alliance","platforms":[{"id":6,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}],"screenshots":[{"id":86182,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/m8tnxta2bfdzycjpg0dj.jpg"},{"id":86183,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/mig537jugptxtlkieas6.jpg"},{"id":86184,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/mpvymitnj5wlwwvlf6vv.jpg"},{"id":86185,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/ngmck8ixqin7oqb1yzla.jpg"},{"id":86186,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/khpobv3agsvkvc6m9py8.jpg"}],"summary":"The conflict is escalating...\n\nA neutral family fights for its business - and its survival - and is swept up in the struggle against the encroaching Empire.

It was originally programmed for the Apple II, and was later ported to several other home computers and early gaming consoles. The game was published in North America by Brøderbund, and in Europe by Ariolasoft.\n\nThe player controls an unnamed protagonist who is attempting to rescue his love interest, the Princess Mariko, from Akuma's castle fortress. The game exhibits a combination of a side-scrolling platform and fighting game elements. The player uses punches and kicks to defeat Akuma and his guards and make his way deeper into the fortress. The game, as with most at the time of development, lacked checkpoints or the ability to save the game, making it a challenge to complete in a single sitting.\n\nKarateka has been well-received, particularly for its realistic animations used for the game's characters.

Wolves have limited ranged attacks but are much faster, stronger, and more durable than their human counterparts. \n \nThe ability to switch between Human and Wolf form at any time adds an element of strategy that is wholly unique to Wolf Team. Players never need worry about running out of ammunition because Wolves have their own distinct advantages – such as running on walls then dropping onto enemies unexpectedly. In certain modes, players can even harness special Wolf mutations, such as Ghost Wolves, which can turn invisible. \n \nVariety is the spice of life; Wolf Team has several addictive game modes to choose from. Just want to engage in an all-out no-holds-barred melee? Fire up a traditional Deathmatch. Interested in joining forces with other players to wage a more cerebral, tactical battle? Try Conquest mode, in which players to work as a team to capture as many bases as possible, or Destruction mode, in which one team tries to demolish the other team's base.

In multiplayer game, you can take on the role of any of the X-Men for mutant deathmatch action in five original maps including the X-Men mansion.","tags":[1,18,268435461,536870926,536871213,536871277,536871882,536872234,536872449,536873299,536874182,536874745,536874947,536875054,536875222,536875265,536875483,536875484,536875585,536875778,536876694,536877764,536880224,536882033,536886010]},{"id":5261,"aggregated_rating":61.4285714285714,"cover":{"id":182029,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co3wgd.jpg"},"name":"WALL-E","platforms":[{"id":5,"name":"Wii"},{"id":6,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"},{"id":8,"name":"PlayStation 2"},{"id":9,"name":"PlayStation 3"},{"id":12,"name":"Xbox 360"},{"id":14,"name":"Mac"},{"id":20,"name":"Nintendo DS"},{"id":38,"name":"PlayStation Portable"}],"screenshots":[{"id":91305,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/km6bj5cajx8ogf43gzjk.jpg"},{"id":91306,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/qjk5itdjxvncwdk3xhcn.jpg"},{"id":91307,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/usq3y0lxqv8odit9nbbt.jpg"},{"id":91308,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/iw5upvani0k9vic6drvq.jpg"},{"id":91309,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/wrdihzdrpunweoh6vdj9.jpg"}],"summary":"Based on the 2008 computer animated film from Pixar Animation Studios, the video game version of WALL-E involves playing as the lonely robot as he navigates a trash-tainted world and begins an unlikely trek across the cosmos.","tags":[1,18,27,34,268435464,268435465,268435487,536870981,536871262,536871446,536871487,536871557,536871583,536871859,536871882,536871939,536872205,536872475,536872535,536872957,536872961,536873064,536873787,536875054,536875055,536875070,536875074,536875157,536875195,536875257,536875258,536875271,536875292,536875294,536875377,536875404,536875748,536875802,536875889,536876028,536876391,536876435,536876694,536877141,536877156,536877182,536877230,536877275,536877630,536879840,536882159,536883736,536883805,536884507]},{"id":45076,"cover":{"id":53585,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/l7dok9ezubsrydkhc2xg.jpg"},"name":"Jimmy Johnson's VR Football '98","platforms":[{"id":7,"name":"PlayStation"}],"summary":"As Interplay's first PlayStation football game under the VR Sports label, Jimmy Johnson's VR Football '98 offers both NFL and NFLPA licenses for real teams and players.
