You, the captain, will go through the process of acquiring a ship and putting together a crew to explore a fictional alternate dimension starting on a planet almost identical to Earth. The only real difference is that in 1968, in this alternate dimension, things went differently. The hippies took over the world and starting with policies of \"no nukes\" took the population down a much different path. \n \nPiloting a spaceship that uses a digital electronics corporation PDP 16 computer system based loosely on the BASIC programming language, you will use a series of ROM interfaces to pilot a ship around a galaxy of ten thousand stars and more than fifty thousand planets trading goods, mining for resources, crafting and fighting off pirates in possibly one of the most bizarre real time strategy games made since 1988. \n \nThe game is largely built around crafting, everything in the universe is player craftable using a very simpler interface but with complexity beyond comprehension. The game is sure to draw in players interested in resource management and creating things. It takes concepts from successful crafting games from as far back at Exodus Ultima IV and as recent as Star Wars Galaxies. What it does not do is create repetitive and mostly boring craft/grind style gameplay and instead focuses on mining, building, experimentation and delivery of goods to market. \n \nThe most interesting part of the game, at least to me, is the graphics style being based off of terminal and mainframe computers from the 1970's. Just do a simple google search on PDP 8 mainframes and you will get the gist of what to expect in game.

There are also several other 'neutral' races such as Merfolk, Greenskins and Elves (the Elves became a full-fledged playable race with the addition of the expansion pack 'Rise of the Elves').\n\nThe gameplay is divided into three main parts; building up the Capital City of your race so that you can research new Warriors and spells, and building up new armies (this involves careful resource management); using heroes (leading small squads) to explore the surroundings, procure resources and attack the enemy; and finally the battles themselves.","tags":[17,39,41,268435471,268435472,536871008,536871208,536871244,536871327,536871504,536871938,536872070,536872232,536872978,536874094,536874134,536874343,536874694,536874830,536875147,536875257,536875304,536875316,536877679,536878369,536879765,536880294,536883035],"videos":[{"id":5986,"video_id":"tGPtAFyQF6M"}]},{"id":111863,"name":"Long Arm of the Law","platforms":[{"id":6,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}],"screenshots":[{"id":265271,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc5oon.jpg"},{"id":265272,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc5ooo.jpg"},{"id":265273,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc5oop.jpg"},{"id":265274,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc5ooq.jpg"},{"id":265275,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc5oor.jpg"},{"id":265276,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc5oos.jpg"},{"id":265277,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc5oot.jpg"},{"id":265278,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc5oou.jpg"}],"summary":"Long Arm of the Law is an action-platformer set in the Robotic West, where one sheriff with an electric revolver and an extendable arm seeks to take back what's his.","tags":[1,268435487,268435488]},{"id":155018,"cover":{"id":161290,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co3gga.jpg"},"name":"Mario's Vacation Course 64","platforms":[{"id":4,"name":"Nintendo 64"}],"screenshots":[{"id":515181,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scb1il.jpg"},{"id":515182,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scb1im.jpg"},{"id":515183,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scb1in.jpg"},{"id":515184,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scb1io.jpg"},{"id":515185,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scb1ip.jpg"},{"id":550202,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scbsje.jpg"}],"summary":"Mario's Vacation Course 64 is a ROM hack/mod of Super Mario 64 developed by Reonu.

With 100 stages consisting of abandoned mines, underground lakes, ancient ruins, glaciers, and more, Spelunker’s goal is to reach the depths of each cave.\n\nCaves are full of dangers including natural terrain, cave creatures, and malicious traps—and enemies and traps that appear to be traces of an unknown civilization will appear in the latter half of the cavern.

The turret has unlimited ammo but a limited angle of fire (up to 90 degrees left and right).\n\nAt first, helicopters start appearing from both sides of the screen's upper part. Paratroopers are jumping down from those helicopters; if four or more of them touch the ground, they will form a human ladder, climb up to the turret, and destroy it. To avoid that, the player has to shoot either the paratroopers themselves or their parachutes - for different effects but the same results.\n\nAfter the player has withstood several waves of helicopters, bomber planes start appearing. These planes shoot bombs directly at the turret, which do not miss and destroy it right away. To counter that, the player can either eliminate the plane before it has the chance to drop the bomb, or destroy the bomb itself in mid-air. Shooting bombs scores the most points (50).\n\nSurviving this stage effectively puts the game on an indefinite loop, with more helicopter and bomber plane stages alternating with increased difficulty. There are no continues and the player has to start over if the turret was destroyed.","tags":[1,268435461,268435489,536870933,536871510,536871937,536875075,536875151,536875262,536875303,536875305,536875904,536876005]},{"id":90199,"cover":{"id":81606,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co1qyu.jpg"},"name":"ACA NEOGEO REAL BOUT FATAL FURY","platforms":[{"id":48,"name":"PlayStation 4"},{"id":49,"name":"Xbox One"},{"id":130,"name":"Nintendo Switch"}],"screenshots":[{"id":333888,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc75mo.jpg"},{"id":333889,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc75mp.jpg"},{"id":333890,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc75mq.jpg"},{"id":333891,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc75mr.jpg"},{"id":333892,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc75ms.jpg"},{"id":333893,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc75mt.jpg"}],"summary":"REAL BOUT FATAL FURY is a fighting game released by SNK in 1995.

Instead the setting this time is Syria in the near future.\n\nAs with previous games in the series the focus lies on tactical ground combat battles. Each battle starts with a mission briefing where the player gets to study the strategic and operational maps and gets a description of the mission. After this the player is moved to the 3D battlefield and the Setup Phase where the action is paused. Here the battlefield has setup zones where the player can position his units. The player can here issue commands to his units, which will be activated once the battle begins. When happy with this the player can choose to start the actual battle.\n\nThe game features a number of gameplay styles. In it's most basic form the game is played in simultaneous time, meaning that a second of play time equals a second of real time. Players can however choose to change this to an alternative playing style. In the real-time mode the battles starts after the setup has been completed and only stops if the player chooses to pause the action. In the turn-based mode, each turn of the battle (except for the first) has three phases. It starts with an command phase where the player issues orders. After this comes the action phase where the units execute their orders. This consists of 60 seconds of real-time action. Last is the replay phase where the player can rewind and replay the action. For the first turn of the battle, the action phase is based on the commands given in the setup phase. The player is not able to issue any more commands in the action and replay phases.\n\nEach battle can have a number of different victory conditions based on different objectives. Three main types of objectives exist: terrain-based, unit-based and force-wide objectives. Terrain-based objectives include occupying an area, destroying a building, defend an area or reaching an area. Unit-based objectives can be tied both to single units or to a group of units and include destroying or spotting specific units. Force-wide objectives include the number of casualties, condition of troops and amount of ammo left.\n\nCombat Mission: Shock Force contains two campaign played from the US side: Yakima Training Center and Task Force Thunder. Yakima Training Center is a training mode for new players that teaches the game mechanics. In the Task Force Thunder campaign players take command of a battalion-sized combined arms Task Force across the Syrian border with the goal of splitting the country in two. Combat Mission campaigns are semi-dynamic which means that they consist of both predetermined elements, as well as some that are based on the actions of the player. Each battle's starting conditions depend on the result of the previous battle.\n\nThe game also has QuickBattles, which is battles where the units and the map are randomly generated depending on what parameters are set by the player. Options include environment, size and weather as well as unit types and quality.\n\nThe game supports two player multiplayer. The real-time mode can be played through LAN or Internet, while the turn-based mode can be played in hotseat (two players on the same computer) or through E-mail.","tags":[268435469,268435471,536870913,536871475,536872019,536872060,536872651,536872733,536874694,536875171,536875572,536876262,536876439,536876442,536876701,536880333,536880335,536880340,536880621,536880821,536881275,536881303,536881305,536881474,536883250],"videos":[{"id":40187,"video_id":"w1nN0j0E3PY"}]},{"id":53345,"cover":{"id":165216,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co3jhc.jpg"},"name":"Majesty: Gold Edition","platforms":[{"id":6,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}],"tags":[268435471]},{"id":29469,"name":"Paulo's Wing","platforms":[{"id":6,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}],"screenshots":[{"id":66981,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/of2mr2rzdaioutfjwncf.jpg"},{"id":66982,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/m52yikou3mcytw0yovi5.jpg"},{"id":66983,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/wp6fw1whxkqdjbra23rr.jpg"},{"id":66984,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/gs9x6bswyqudmfedj713.jpg"},{"id":66985,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/tqqljaiem2rjc07uizim.jpg"}],"summary":"Play as the last able cherub tasked with defending heavens gate from scores of demons!
