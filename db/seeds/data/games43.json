This time, the two unlikely heroes are being used as pawns in a grand scheme by a mysterious mastermind named Kotovsky and his even more mysterious \"behind-the-scenes\" boss, who want to change the political face of Russia forever. Will Petka and his mentor be able to thwart the danger and save their homeland once again?.. \n \nNot much has changed in this installment; as all the previous games in the series, Konec Igry (\"End of the Game\") is a traditional point-and-click adventure game, with 2D cartoon-like character graphics and backgrounds. The gameplay mostly revolves around talking to characters, gathering information, and solving puzzles mostly through manipulation of inventory items.",

More Enhanced Graphics Adapter (EGA) and SoundBlaster support-ish! \n* Gamepad.. err.. joystick support! \n* Modern quality-of-life improvements! \n \nWith its futuristic 17-color graphics and enhanced Musical Instrument Digital Interface (MIDI), Little Square Things is going to blow you away. \n \nSo boot up your i386, tinker with your CONFIG.SYS, and crack your knuckles in preparation for that DOS prompt, because it\u0027s time to play a game! Also, it\u0027s 1991!",

    "summary": "Dive into the Middle Ages and play the successor to the worldwide #1 hit, Bridge Constructor\n\nBridge Constructor Medieval turns back the clock a few centuries to the time of knights and castles. Build sturdy bridges to supply your city with provisions - or cunningly constructed bridges that collapse under the weight of attacking troops, sending the horde of enemies into the abyss below. You won’t even be safe from cannon fire in the 40 brand new levels. Protect your foot soldiers and your horse-drawn carriages with covered bridges and stable pillar structures.\n\nThere are a total of five materials available to help you build the perfect bridge: wood, heavy wood, stone and ropes, along with the new addition of the bridge roof. Throughout the exciting background story, you will familiarize yourself with the various materials on a step-by-step basis, and learn everything you need to know so that your bridges meet the requirements of the different levels.\n\nInnovative game modes in store for you! Besides building stable bridges, there\u0027s also plenty on offer for veterans to discover in the new game modes. In the siege level, your bridge is bombarded by enemy catapults. Strengthen your bridge so that it doesn\u0027t collapse, and protect your own troops on the bridge with a bridge roof.\n\nIn another new game mode, you build your bridges so that they collapse under the load of enemy units to send as many of them as possible into the abyss. In addition, the unique bonus challenges will leave even the most experienced players at their wit’s end. That way, both bridge-building professionals and novices will face a challenge in Bridge Constructor Medieval.",

The game design was led by David Jones, who created the original Grand Theft Auto and Crackdown, and was developed by Realtime Worlds. It was released on June 6, 2010 in North America and Europe. \n \nAfter Realtime Worlds was placed into administration on August 17, 2010, the servers for online play were shut down later that year, but were reactivated when online gaming company K2 Network purchased APB for £1.5 million and relaunched it under their subsidiary company Reloaded Productions as a free-to-play game, renamed APB: Reloaded.",

The game was the last to be released by any company for the American NES. Like all Wisdom Tree games, Sunday Funday was not officially licensed by Nintendo. According to the game\u0027s instruction manual, the player controls a skateboarding hero who is late for Sunday school. In the game, the hero must use his skateboard and any objects he finds, such as balloons, grapefruits, and newspapers, to defeat bullies, clowns, and businessmen who are attempting to impede his path to Sunday school. The Sunday Funday game cartridge included two features other than the game itself - an arcade-style game titled Fish Fall and a sing-a-long of a song by Christian pop band 4Him. Sunday Funday is a ripped-off version of Menace Beach, also released by Color Dreams, excepting a few graphics and a complete story change. While the hero in Menace Beach fights ninjas and evil clowns on his way to rescue his girlfriend from Demon Dan, the hero in Sunday Funday fights bullies and businessmen on his way to Sunday school. Additionally, the hero carries a bible in Sunday Funday but not in Menace Beach. Finally, in Menace Beach, the hero\u0027s girlfriend appears wearing less and less clothing between levels, but she is replaced by a fully clothed Sunday school teacher in Sunday Funday.",

As in the previous .hack games, .hack//G.U. simulates a massively multiplayer online role-playing game as the player controls a character who starts playing it.\n\nPlayers assume the role of a participant in a fictional game called The World. While in The World, the player controls the on-screen player character, Haseo, from a third-person person perspective (with optional first-person mode). The player may control the camera using the game controller\u0027s right analog stick. Within the fictional game, players explore monster-infested fields and dungeons as well as \"Root Towns\" that are free of combat. They also can \"log-off\" from the game and return to a computer desktop interface which includes in-game e-mail, news, and message boards, as well as desktop and background music customization options. In Reminisce, an optional card game called \"Crimson VS\" becomes available. The player may save the game to a memory card both from the desktop and within The World at a Save Shop. After the player completes the game, a Data Flag appears on the save file, which allows the transfer of all aspects of the player character and party members to the next game in the series. This can also be applied to previous games if the player first finished the Reminsce or Redemption.\n\nPlayers can attack monsters in real time. However, the action pauses whenever the menu is opened in order to select magic to cast, items to use, or skills to perform. The player only directly controls Haseo, while the other characters are controlled by artificial intelligence. The player may either provide guidelines (\"Free Will\", \"Rage\", \"Life\", etc.) or issue direct commands (for example, to cast a particular magic at a particular enemy) to the computer-controlled characters. Monsters roam the environments freely or guard treasure chests. Once combat is initiated, via a \"surprise attack\" or the player being spotted, a wall erects around the combat area to prevent escape. Weapons give the player access to the Skill Trigger feature which allows them to perform a powerful attack at the cost of losing SPs. As an adept rogue character, Haseo can wield multiple weapons for close combat. Although Haseo can only use one weapon per battle, during Reminisce the player can change weapons in the middle of Skill Triggers. Under certain conditions, the player may execute an enhanced type of Skill Trigger called \"Rengeki\". These attacks deal greater damage and fill a Morale gauge, which allows the player and his team members to use a combination attack. Certain plot-related fights, called \"Avatar battles\", use a different interface which incorporates shoot \u0027em up gameplay elements. After depleting the opponent\u0027s health, players must charge up a \"Data Drain\" to end the battle.\n\nRoot Towns are non-combat areas in The World. The player may restock on items, buy equipment, or chat and trade with other \"players\" of The World. The player may also undertake optional quests and visit guilds. A key feature of all towns is the Chaos Gate. This blue portal is used to travel between towns (called \"servers\") as well as access the fields and dungeons where battles take place. A password system controls the characteristics of each area. Depending on the characteristics of each word in the three word phrase, the resulting area may have different attributes such as prevalence of monsters or items, among other features.",

    "summary": "This entry in the Klonoa series sees the floppy-eared hero training to become a true hero in a new RPG system. \n \nKlonoa Heroes: Densetsu no Star Medal is a spin-off of the Klonoa franchise, released only in Japan on December 13, 2002. Klonoa Heroes was developed by Namco and published by Namco for the Game Boy Advance. Klonoa Heroes is a twist on the traditional Klonoa games, putting Klonoa in a more action role playing game along the lines of Legend of Zelda or Beyond Oasis. The game does have voice acting, as well. Kumiko Watanabe plays Klonoa, Takahiro Sakurai plays Guntz, Shouzou Iizuke plays Pango, and Yutaka Shimaka plays Garlen. \n \nKlonoa Heroes\u0027 gameplay is very similar to the gameplay of The Legend of Zelda. Players can control one of three characters (Klonoa, Guntz, and Pango) in a top-down perspective, hitting enemies with various attacks (Klonoa with the Wind Ring seen in the platforming games, albeit with a few differences). Guntz uses a handgun, while Pango throws bombs. In addition, these characters can collect more weapons as the game progresses. Every enemy in the game is given a color (either blue or red), and the player must attack that enemy with the corresponding attack (as each weapon has a blue and red attack). \n \nKlonoa Heroes also has role playing aspects. Experience points are gathered by picking up Dream Shards after defeating enemies (failure to pick them up results in no experience). Enemies also drop coins, which can be spent on items and weapons. These items can be found in chests scattered throughout the levels, as well. Most items can be used to restore health, but there are various other uses (such as stat benefits). Leveling up also allows the player to distribute points in several different areas (traditional role playing game stats, such as attack, defense, and agility). These changes are not permanent, and can be changed at any time (when not in the middle of a level).",

    "summary": "The universe is made up of human and synthetic lifeforms. Synthetic lifeforms are considered second class citizens by their human counterparts. The story takes place on the prison planet Alpha Prime, a world completely designed for the holding of criminals. You are a synthetic lifeform sentenced for an eternity for a crime you didn\u0027t commit and in order to earn your freedom, you must compete against other prisoners in competitions in 10 different incarceration facilities. To compete in these competitions however, you must undergo a procedure that removes your legs and replaces it with a rolling sphere.\n\nThere are seven different events to compete in which are Pursuit, Last Man Rolling, Race, King of the Hill, Run the Gauntlet, Tag, and Powerball that pit you not only against your fellow inmates and guards, but against the levels themselves. Run the gauntlet charges you with making it to a goal point within a time limit, all the while avoiding other warriors and obstacles such as flame throwers, spikes, and gun turrets. Pursuit is identical, but it adds the challenge of the arena crumbling away. Powerball has you collecting balls throughout the arena and throwing them at a goalpost before time runs out. Tag has you collecting a set number of tokens that have been scattered throughout the arena within a set time limit.",

    "summary": "Unreal Estate is a strategy game, developed by Larry Martin and Phillip Brossia, and published by Afterthought Games, which was released in 2017. \n \nUnreal Estate is an actual table top card game made by Grand Gamers Guild, a first time publisher right here in Grand Rapids Michigan. We took that game and turned it into a digital reproduction. It follows all the rules and uses all the same cards that the physical version does. \n \nSo the point to the game is simple, you collect cards based on the point value on the card, and when you have cards that match some of the cards in the scrap pile, you can score. The scrap pile cards act as multipliers so the more of them that are there, the better. We add in 9 different special cards but only a few at a time, so each game plays a little bit different. \n \nPlay this game against AI in 2, 3, or 4 player action, or play our cross platform multi player games against random people.",

You control Alec, a teenager whose entire village was destroyed by an unknown evil - an event that was later called \"The Great Disaster\". He was saved by a mysterious Hunter. Since then, growing peacefully in a village he was brought to, which was like a new home for the survivors of the Great Disaster, Alec dreams about meeting the Hunter again, and becoming a Hunter himself. Together with his best friend Lutz he tries his luck in nearby towns, receiving small Hunter jobs, until the fate crosses the ways of the two young people with a mysterious organization called the Academy. And there their adventure really begins...\n\nThe gameplay of this third installment of Arc the Lad series is very similar to that of the predecessor. You fight enemies in turn-based battles, and can move freely on the battlefield, positioning your party members the way you like. You can upgrade your weapons by forging them with special materials, and have a variety of techniques and magic spells at your disposal.",

While pursuing his archenemy, Elk meets up with Arc, the hero of the first game, and then both realize they have been looking to destroy the very same evil.\n\nThe battle system of \"Arc the Lad II\" is similar to the one used in its predecessor: in battles you can move your characters on the battle field, and your proximity to the enemies plays an important role. You cause and take different amounts of damage depending on your position on the battle field. Unlike the first game, this one is a full-fledged adventure/RPG, without the \"strategy\" feel of the predecessor. You move through the game world on your own, visiting towns and exploring dungeons.",

It subtly connects players in real-time across the world, to help one another in a battle against gravity. \n \n* Build a Tower. The mission is simple. But once again, things get in the way... Explosives, thunderstorms, completely incompetent colleagues. Oh, and have you heard of this thing called gravity? \n \n* Play with your friends. Dreii automatically connects all screens across all platforms. This means you can even play with your friends who have Dreii on their mobiles. \n \n* Speak in 19 Languages. Dreii features an universal communication tool which allows players to speak to others, wherever they are in the world. \n \n* Let\u0027s Dance! One of the best thing about Dreii is how it sounds. Each player has its very own instrument. Avatars work together to form Dreii\u0027s unique universal orchestra, creating a unique musical landscape, inspired by archaic instruments and ancient melodies. \n \n* Uber Swiss Design. Dreii is designed to be as universal as possible. However, in a strange way it\u0027s also very Swiss, where it was made. Clean typography, minimalism with attention to detail. Maybe that is why it has won the European Design Award.",

Graphics are presented in pixelated two-tone style but offer a touch of detail, customization and precision that pushes beyond the limits of its inspirations. Adjust the color palette, choose between multiple play modes, purchase upgrades and overcome unpredictably shuffled stage order with each run! \n \nThe objective is simple – clear all enemies from the rooms you enter, obtain a key and proceed to the next level. But victory is far from certain as new types of enemies aim to end your run and a boss encounter awaits every five stages. Kill or be killed! Take each one down quickly and strategically to collect coins and buy power-ups to stack the deck in your favor.",

    "summary": "Welcome to the future. In the early 21st century, gang warfare and crime have lead to the creation of privatised law enforcement. The Anti-Crime Network (ACN) employs bounty hunters known as ‘Headhunters’ to track down the most wanted criminals, using combat skills and high-tech weaponry. You are Jack Wade, an ex-cop turned Headhunter. At the beginning of the game you find yourself strapped to an operating table and manage to escape. After passing out in an alley, you awake in hospital from a coma. With your license revoked and few memories, you are hired by Angela Stern, to find her fathers murderer. Maybe you’ll even find out what happened to yourself if you can stay alive long enough… Headhunter is an action adventure viewed from over the shoulder. In the top right of the screen you have a radar which will track your movements and those of the enemy. Jack has a few moves at his disposal. He can duck and roll, push, pull and climb objects as well as flatten himself up against a wall. Using this technique he can peek around corners for a better view of the action, and then attack from this position, using the wall as protection. Between levels, Jack has a motorcycle that he uses to transport himself between various locations in the city according to the clues he receives. You will need to earn skill points however before you can arrive at a destination. Certain parts of the city are unavailable until you have gained the appropriate Headhunter license. As you have no recollection of your past, you have to take a series of licenses that will grant you access to greater parts of the city, weaponry and gadgets. These are taken in a VR simulator known as the Law Enforcement Intelligence and Licence Approval (LEILA). At various times in the game you will need to go to the LEILA building and upgrade your licence by practising your combat, stealth and driving skills.",

    "summary": "700 years before the events of Ys I \u0026 II, the land of Ys was on the brink of destruction. Demons came in droves and forced the twin Goddesses who ruled the land to whisk their subjects away from the surface, into the safe embrace of the clouds. The demons were persistent, however, erecting a massive tower in pursuit. The battle that raged upon the ground had begun ascending for a second round up above.\nOne day, amidst this turmoil, the Goddesses stole away into the night, vanishing from Ys altogether. And there\u0027s only one place they could have gone: the Devil\u0027s Tower.\n\nA search party of knights and sorcerers was hastily formed and dispatched to the surface in hopes of retrieving these runaway deities. Among its members were apprentice knight Yunica Tovah and troubled sorcerer Hugo Fact.\n\nThis is their story. Or at least, it\u0027s how each of them remembers it.\n\nExpanding upon the gameplay elements introduced in Ys: The Ark of Napishtim and further developed in Ys: The Oath in Felghana, Ys Origin perfects the formula by adding different styles of play and new features never before seen in the Ys universe. Best described as an arcade-like platformer RPG with Metroidvania elements and a complex, multi-faceted narrative, Ys Origin is the perfect mix of action, exploration and story. Screen-filling bosses with complex AI, unique platforming elements, innovative puzzles and a deeply involving mystery await within the wildly varied confines of this classic Ys dungeon.\n\nCome see how long you can last in the Devil\u0027s Tower...",

The primary goal is to stop the oil drums and the silverware whose goal is to kill the player.\nSimilar to Candy Land, this game has the player spin a spinner to move a specified amount of spaces told by the spinner to move. The regular space is the player\u0027s own space, red space indicates another spin, a red circle connected to another red circle has the player move one step forward or backward. If the space has a red circle with a question mark in it, the player can take a pop quiz of three trivia questions and then, if succeeded, gets to select either a key, a heart or move ahead one-four spaces, along with the prize of winning a star. If the player lands on the happy face, something rewarding happens such as moving ahead ten spaces, getting a key, heart etc. If the sad face is landed on, something unrewarding happens, including a loss of a turn, moving back a space, etc. At the end of the game, a bonus is awarded to the player who got to the end first and/or got the most pop quiz stars aside collecting the most food. After that, the entire amount of points is shown to each player.",

    "summary": "Your objective is to gather gold that is scattered on the brick platforms, which are connected by ladders. You are chased by robots (cyborgs) that end your character\u0027s life if they catch him, though you can stand on their heads. Your main weapon is the ability to dig both to the left and right of your character. The holes you dig are only temporary and fill themselves in. A robot that falls into one of your holes will be destroyed if the hole fills in before it can escape. Your character can also suffer this same fate, ending his life. Destroyed robots are replaced with new ones that appear from the top of the screen. The robots can also carry gold which they drop if they fall into a hole. The robot\u0027s movements are dependent on yours, and a significant facet of the game play is figuring out how to use the robot\u0027s movements to your advantage in clearing a stage. Besides bricks and ladders, levels also consist of blocks (which can\u0027t be dug into), rope (to traverse platform chasms) and crumbling bricks (which you fall through). Once all gold has been retrieved a missing segment of ladder will appear allowing your character to escape to the next level. Some levels contain keys and doors which provide an alternate way to leave a level.",

    "summary": "A visceral body horror Yume Nikki fan game that ceased development in 2018.\n\nFleshchild is a semi-episodic exploration/adventure game, similar to and inspired by Yume Nikki. You follow a baby eldritch abomination-type entity named Vis as it \"grows up\" at the behest of its parent, a giant red eyeball who lives in a sewer. The game has two main segments: Reality, and Dreaming.\n\nReality: Vis explores sections of Ashvale city to find whatever body parts its parent requests for the night. Gameplay in reality involves exploration, item collection, solving simple puzzles, and maybe killing people for body parts. Vis can get advice from its fellows in the sewer, alongside Visybil, who can provide more information on the objective and plot.\n\nDreaming: Vis explores their dreams as they sleep during the day. Gameplay in dreams involves exploration and item collection, and later on will include puzzles. The dreams end abruptly and without warning, so thoroughly exploring one THEMED location (such as the entirety of a hospital) before moving to the next will reward Vis with the best experience each dream has to offer.",

Although the game was not the first to simulate snooker (or pool) in 3D, it made full use of the processing power and graphics capabilities of 16-bit home computers and was praised for its then ground-breaking realism and easy-to-use interface. Many remarked that the game was the closest thing to being on a real snooker table which existed at the time, and it could be used by a player to refine real-life snooker skills. \n \nDespite being an accurate and serious simulation of the sport, MacLean\u0027s irreverent sense of humour was prominent throughout. The sound effect used for a successful pot was a resounding \"pop\" and numerous animations provided comic relief should a player take more than a few seconds to shoot. Balls would sprout eyeballs and arms, making faces at the player or holding up signs that read \"Get on with it!\" and such. \n \nThe game was followed by Archer MacLean\u0027s Pool in 1992 and Jimmy White\u0027s 2: Cueball in 1999.",

This ritual is tightly connected with relics of the past collected by his Knights of St. Anthony in places visited by Ben Jordan in previous cases. \n \nJust like the previous titles the genre is a classic icon-based point-and-click adventure with voice-overs. The player controls Ben Jordan in London and Paris most of the game, but also Ben\u0027s Grandfather, Arthur Jordan, while he was accompanied by Percy Q. Jones in the land of Romania to fight vampires in 1926. There are several puzzles and time-based sequences, where protagonists should think quickly to achieve the desired result or they can even die.",

Players become a hunter who must travel the world and take on jobs, usually revolving around taking out enemies in real time using magic and special abilities. Collect cards from battle and events and equip them to gain new skills, all the while following an RPG-like storyline. You view the action from overhead, with a camera zooming in and out depending on the intensity of the action and occasionally switching to other angles for dramatic effect. You attack enemies in real time, tapping X once for a simple attack and repeatedly for a combo. You can also guard against attack, dash at an enemy, and press a button to run about the play field faster. The game places heavy emphasis on magic use, with the magic meter recovering automatically and quickly following each spell.",

To help you learn the controls, a boot camp option offers a series of eight training missions.\n\nOnce you are ready, choose from two campaigns: desert and alpine. Review your objectives before each mission on the briefing screen, and prepare for battle against an onslaught of plastic troops. A mission will fail if you exceed the time limit, allow your rivals to win, or let Sarge die. The options screen lets you view current objectives, consult a strategic map, exit vehicles, and abort your mission.

Learn to predict your foes’ moves, deftly dodge their attacks, and create opportunities for devastating counterattacks.\n\nStart with the Sakura Sword, a little health, and some basic training from your water-spirit guide. Make your way from battleground to battleground fighting wave after wave of increasingly cunning enemies. Fight through huge castles to duel epic bosses.
