It is based on the rise of the Roman Empire, and adds the Roman Empire and three other playable civilizations to Age of Empires.\n\nGameplay-wise, the expansion introduced numerous interface tweaks, such as unit queuing, the ability to double click a single unit and highlight others of the same unit-type, balancing damage done by catapults, and the option to increase the population limit beyond 50 (only in multiplayer games). By installing the 1.0a update from 1999, it is also possible to use the period key to cycle through idle villagers. The Rise of Rome also features a new Roman architectural design, shared by all four new civilizations, the Romans, Palmyrans, Macedonians and Carthaginians. Four new researchable technologies have been added. Additional new features include five new units, four new random map types, and a larger map size option. Pathfinding for all units is also considerably improved. New music was composed for this expansion, which replaced the original score entirely. After the last official patch by the developer, the game's community continued the support by an own-made unofficial patch to address remaining issues and to improve compatibility with modern hardware and OSes.","tags":[22,268435467,268435469,268435471,536871205,536872495],"videos":[{"id":16412,"video_id":"kz6e-Ov0Tws"}]},{"id":49190,"cover":{"id":82922,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co1rze.jpg"},"name":"Disney's Little Einsteins","platforms":[{"id":24,"name":"Game Boy Advance"}],"screenshots":[{"id":350196,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc7i7o.jpg"},{"id":350197,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc7i7p.jpg"},{"id":350198,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc7i7q.jpg"},{"id":350199,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc7i7r.jpg"},{"id":350200,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc7i7s.jpg"},{"id":350201,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc7i7t.jpg"},{"id":350202,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc7i7u.jpg"},{"id":350203,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc7i7v.jpg"}],"summary":"Inspired by the hit Playhouse Disney television series on the Disney Channel, Disney's Little Einsteins for the Game Boy Advance takes children on entertaining adventures with their favorite characters from the show.

A title that announced Team17's arrival as a quality indie developer-publisher... quite some years before they had a hit with those little pink blighters, WormsTM.\n\nThe game was an instant success and a sequel of sorts, Alien Breed Directors Cut, released in 1992 spending an incredible 33 unbroken weeks at the top of the UK Gallup Budget Charts. A full sequel was released in 1993 (Alien Breed 2) and a 3D edition, which won a number of technical achievement awards in 1994.

It was announced for the Nintendo 3DS on September 29, 2010, during a Nintendo press conference for the 3DS.\n\nThe game was to be directed by Masakuza Eguchi, with Tatsuya Kitabayashi acting as producer. Reo Uratani composed the game's music.\n\nMega Man Legends 3: Prototype Version, known (roughly) as \"Rockman DASH 3: The Prologue! Showing you the Game's Underbelly Version\" in Japan, was an early version of the game that would be available for download in the Nintendo 3DS's eShop. The prototype would have feature playable segments as Barrett and ten missions. It was originally planned to be available upon the launch of the 3DS eShop on June 6, but it was delayed to be improved. Initially, it was said by Capcom that if the Mega Man Legends 3 Prototype Version does not do well upon its release in the eShop, Mega Man Legends 3 may be cancelled, but the Prototype Version was cancelled along with the main game.\n\nOn July 18, 2011, a message was posted in the Devroom announcing the discontinuation of the project. The reason for the cancellation was that \"it was not felt that the Mega Man Legends 3 project met the required criteria\". No further explanation was given, and the Japanese Devroom was closed on August 19.","tags":[536876252],"videos":[{"id":49271,"video_id":"nSzzXnv5JYo"},{"id":49272,"video_id":"tOolUGaJbb4"},{"id":49273,"video_id":"0nhknfk8_iM"}]},{"id":72945,"cover":{"id":91141,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co1ybp.jpg"},"name":"Wolfenstein: Youngblood - Deluxe Edition","platforms":[{"id":6,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"},{"id":48,"name":"PlayStation 4"},{"id":49,"name":"Xbox One"},{"id":130,"name":"Nintendo Switch"}],"screenshots":[{"id":297501,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc6djx.jpg"},{"id":299316,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc6eyc.jpg"},{"id":299317,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc6eyd.jpg"},{"id":299318,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc6eye.jpg"}],"summary":"Wolfenstein: Youngblood is a brand-new co-op adventure from award-winning studio MachineGames, developers of the critically-acclaimed Wolfenstein II: The New Colossus, in partnership with Arkane Studios Lyon. \n \nThe Deluxe Edition includes the Buddy Pass, allowing you and a friend to play the entire game together, even if they don't own the game themselves.
