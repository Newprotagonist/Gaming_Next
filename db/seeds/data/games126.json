Crash is able to defeat enemies by either jumping on them or using a spinning attack that launches them. Crash will lose a life if he is hit by an enemy or obstacle, or falls into a bottomless pit. Crash can protect himself by collecting Aku Aku masks, which protect Crash from a single hit from an enemy or obstacle (but not pits or other instant-death obstacles). Crash can hold onto two masks at a time and, upon collecting a third mask, will gain temporary invincibility. The game ends when the player runs out of lives, with more lives earned by finding extra life items or by collecting 100 Wumpa Fruits.","tags":[1,18,268435464,268435487,536871213,536871306,536871364,536871470,536871577,536871701,536871882,536871931,536872225,536872961,536873021,536873111,536873455,536873671,536874398,536874745,536875050,536875073,536875074,536875076,536875081,536875088,536875095,536875151,536875152,536875199,536875209,536875213,536875271,536875284,536875310,536875376,536875389,536875394,536875396,536875488,536875621,536875638,536875639,536875699,536875702,536875714,536875791,536875803,536875819,536875830,536875870,536875902,536875921,536876120,536876207,536876270,536876331,536876348,536876353,536876357,536876526,536876551,536876570,536876619,536876717,536876874,536876943,536876952,536877048,536877049,536877058,536877230,536877490,536877801,536878147,536878197,536878430,536878439,536878505,536878567,536878594,536879026,536879993,536880276,536880311,536880417,536880441,536883092,536883451,536883590,536883622,536884169,536884403,536886533],"videos":[{"id":34658,"video_id":"QdFQVnm85ao"}]},{"id":19332,"aggregated_rating":75.0,"cover":{"id":15675,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/znictvlcucg8kcmrk6cy.jpg"},"name":"Excubitor","platforms":[{"id":3,"name":"Linux"},{"id":6,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"},{"id":14,"name":"Mac"}],"screenshots":[{"id":86900,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/cehzvzgivi1imic9h0ku.jpg"},{"id":86901,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/mamypjh4iavspj8avrc5.jpg"},{"id":86902,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/tflki5bylvs802vvt61e.jpg"},{"id":86903,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/twok1si2ewuka6vyj9f4.jpg"},{"id":86904,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/ai39cobybhuf4nppa8wo.jpg"}],"summary":"In this classic inspired Tower Defense Bullet Hell Shooter, security bots have revolted and you, the sole surviving pilot, are all that stands between the colonies and defeat.

It is a heavily localized version of the Japanese game Dragon Ball: Shenron no Nazo. Although some of the European releases retain the Dragon Ball assets (under the title Dragon Ball), the North American release removes most references to the franchise. The game follows the first two volumes of the Dragon Ball manga, as the young monkey-tailed boy Goku (along with his teenage friend, Bulma, known in the North American version as Nora), embark on a quest to find all seven Dragon Balls (Crystal Balls in the NA version), in which it is believed that collecting them grants the user any wish they desire. Along the way, they encounter various characters, including turtle hermit Master Roshi (Hermit in the NA version), shapeshifting anthropomorphic pig Oolong (Pudgy in the NA version) and desert bandit Yamcha (Lancer in the NA version).\n\nThis port also has less stages than the original game.","tags":[1,17,268435481,268435487,536870990,536871244,536874038,536874098,536875073,536875222,536875291,536875338,536875472,536875523,536875620,536875622,536875637,536875712,536875881,536876241,536876494,536876694,536876711,536877002,536877006,536877029,536877559,536878458,536879095,536880342,536881319,536881606,536899915]},{"id":102087,"aggregated_rating":65.0,"cover":{"id":115421,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co2h25.jpg"},"name":"Leisure Suit Larry: Wet Dreams Don't Dry","platforms":[{"id":6,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"},{"id":14,"name":"Mac"},{"id":48,"name":"PlayStation 4"},{"id":49,"name":"Xbox One"},{"id":130,"name":"Nintendo Switch"}],"screenshots":[{"id":212789,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/ickwvznalbkoffsecwcg.jpg"},{"id":212790,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/tq9g3fd7h1so7gstlmko.jpg"},{"id":212791,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/c4xqsdcs7u2bjvevaky1.jpg"},{"id":258404,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc5jdw.jpg"},{"id":258405,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc5jdx.jpg"},{"id":258406,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc5jdy.jpg"},{"id":258407,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc5jdz.jpg"}],"summary":"Hey ladies, I’m back in business!

Explore an immersive new world from the dark forests of Germania across the mighty Rhine to the marshlands of the Seine. A larger scale map tests your tactics with more manoeuvring room on the battlefield and visualizes the details of ancient life with garrisons standing guard along the city walls and workers tending their crops in the fields.\n\nCapturing the ingenuity of Caesar and his engineers, all-new construction options and a new wood resource let you build bridges, forts and supply camps at thousands of points across the map. And a significantly expanded upgrade system gives you new options to promote officers, assign governors and construct buildings to specialize your units and cities. Plus, new improvements to Hegemony's celebrated logistics model makes managing your supplies more intuitive and more important than ever.\n\nHegemony Rome brings the past to life as you manage your armies and manipulate your enemies in a beautifully drawn simulation of 1st century BC warfare.
