    "summary": "StarCraft: Ghost is a cancelled military science fiction stealth-action video game previously under development by Blizzard Entertainment. Part of Blizzard\u0027s StarCraft series, the game was announced on September 20, 2002, and was to be developed by Nihilistic Software for the Nintendo GameCube, Xbox, and PlayStation 2 video game consoles. Several delays in development caused Blizzard to move back the release date and the game has not yet materialized. Nihilistic Software ceded development to Swingin\u0027 Ape Studios in 2004 before Blizzard bought the company, and plans for the GameCube version were cancelled in 2005.\n\nBlizzard announced in March 2006 that the game was put on \"indefinite hold\" while the company investigated seventh generation video game console possibilities. Subsequent public statements from company personnel had been contradictory about whether production was to be renewed or planned story elements worked into other products. The continued delay of Ghost had caused it to be labeled as vaporware, and it was ranked fifth in Wired News‍ \u0027​ annual Vaporware Awards in 2005. In 2014, Blizzard president Mike Morhaime confirmed that Ghost was officially cancelled.\n\nUnlike its real-time strategy predecessor StarCraft, Ghost is a third-person shooter, and was intended to give players a closer and more personal view of the StarCraft universe. Following Nova, a Terran psychic espionage operative called a \"ghost\", the game is set four years after the conclusion of StarCraft: Brood War and covers a conspiracy about a secretive military project conducted by Nova\u0027s superiors in the imperial Terran Dominion. Very little of the game\u0027s storyline has been released; however, in November 2006 after the game\u0027s postponement, a novel was published called StarCraft Ghost: Nova, which covers the backstory of the central character.",

Similarly to Sierra adventures, the player directly controls the movements of Maddog and types in text commands to perform an action. As usual he explores his surroundings, collects items and uses them to solve puzzles. There are also a few action-based sequences in the game. If the player meets an enemy the game switches to the fighting view. The combat is in real time and the player controls Maddog\u0027s basic movements: side steps, blocking and attacking in two different heights. There are three difficulty levels which mostly influence the combat but the lowest one also results in easier puzzles.",

The radiations, low temperatures and the atmosphere without oxygen will kill you. \nThe meteorites can also kill you and/or destroy your base. \n \nThe modular system will let you create something as you like. \nCreate 3D parts by using a 3D printer and start building your base. \n \nThe abandoned rovers from Mars soil will give you parts to build a good rover. You also can create it with 3D printed parts. Or you can combine them and use the remaining parts to other projects. \n \nYour temporary home will be a spacecraft. You also will have few items to survive until you will make a farm, a base and other things that will help you to survive. \nYou can create water in 2 ways: \nBy \u0027boiling\u0027 the soil, and by burning hydrogen and oxygen. \nYou can grow different plants in your base: arabidopsis, mizuna lettuce, super dwarf wheat, apogey wheat, brassica rapa, rice, tulips, kalanchoe, flax, onions, peas, radishes, lettuce, wheat, garlic, cucumbers, parsley, dill, lettuce and cinnamon basil. \n \nYou can mine in different ways, but the simple one is to create a drilling machine and to place it where you want to drill. After it will finish drilling, you can get the \u0027drilled ore\u0027 and melt it to extract the metals. \n \nYou can use portable power banks to store energy from solar panels. If you want to use a PPB (Portable Power Bank) in a rover/vehicle, you can do that to charge it and use it on a vehicle/rover. \nBut, if you want to connect solar panels directly to the base, you can also do that. \n \nYou can sell goods (metals and other things) from Mars to Earth by using a small spacecraft. You will receive some coins and you can use them to buy something from Earth.",

    "summary": "Nickelodeon GUTS is based off of the Nickelodeon TV show in the late 90\u0027s that is basically American Gladiators for kids. The events in the game are based off of the actual game show events with the main goal being to score as many points as possible while trying to beat the clock.\n\nIn Elastic Sports, the player is strapped onto a long bungee cord and is bounced around. There are three events: Slam Dunk is a basketball game, Attack is lacrosse and Spiral where the objective is to throw a football through a hanging tire.\n\nAction Sports is an obstacle course which someone would find at a boot camp and is divided into two events: Basic Training involves poles, swinging ropes and punching bags and Tornado Run which adds water jets and moving platforms. Players can also pick up bonus items that will add time or replenish health and a chance at the bonus round.\n\nThe final event is the Aggro Crag which is a giant indoor mountain the player must climb while avoiding various obstacles such as confetti cannons, moving platforms and smoke vents. The goal of this event is to navigate the mountain and activate five different sensors located on the mountain before being able to activate the last one at the very top of the mountain.\n\nThere is also an option for two friends to compete either head-to-head or alternating depending upon the event. Elastic lets the players compete against each other on a split-screen while Action Sports and the Aggro Crag has to be played through alternating play.",

Along the way he repeatedly encounters his arch-rival, the voluptuous sorceress Dela Delon, who’s just as interested in claiming the bounty on his head as she is in escaping the maze herself. With each floor boasting unrelenting enemies fought in real time, elaborate booby traps, ancient treasures, tricky puzzles and thousand-year-old mysteries to solve, Brandish promises to keep players fighting for survival till the bitter end.",

    "summary": "Motorbike racer set in the Top Gear series. The Championship mode has you alternating between dirt and street racing as you compete for points. You earn new bikes and courses along the way like many other games, but interesting twist is going from one kind of racing to the other. The physics of each type of racing are very different, and you\u0027ll have to switch back and forth between dirt and racing tactics on the fly. The dirt bike racing is a lot more arcadey with all of the jumps and wide open tracks. You can earn turbo by pulling off tricks and there\u0027s really nothing to stop you from testing your stunt skills while racing except your own nerve and imagination. In this way, Hyperbike is like Hydro Thunder where you\u0027re expected to lean on that turbo button the whole time and it\u0027s up to your racing skills to ensure there\u0027s turbo available.",

    "summary": "Thunderhawk (AH-3 Thunderstrike in North America) is a combat flight simulator video game developed by Core Design and released for the Amiga and DOS in 1992, for the Sega CD in 1993 and for Microsoft Windows in 1996. In the game the player flies a fictional AH-73M attack helicopter.\n\nThe game consists of several campaigns for each one of ten world areas. The campaigns are themed around real events or activities in these areas (e.g. escorting a UN humanitarian convoy during the Bosnian War, fighting pirates in the South China Sea, etc.)\n\nA typical campaign consists of four or five missions. Each mission has a primary objective that must be completed to successfully complete the mission, there are other targets in each missions such as tanks and SAM launchers but these are only used to help the player boost their score. The primary target is usually a major structure like an enemy base or a bridge.\n\nUsually the player is equipped with a standard set of weapons - 16 missiles, 76 rockets, and a machine gun with unlimited ammunition. On some special missions the rockets are replaced by a weapon that is critical to the success of that particular mission, such as a runway cratering system when the primary objective is to destroy an airbase or a bomb when destruction of a bridge is the primary objective.\n\nThe control system for Thunderhawk was fairly unique for the platforms supporting a mouse. It used the mouse for basic control, plus some keyboard input for rarely used commands. Moving the mouse would tilt the helicopter in the specified direction, and make it start moving in that direction. Pressing the left mouse button fires weapons. When the right mouse button was held, moving the mouse up and down changed altitude, while side to side yawed the helicopter side to side.",

It was the final cricket game in the series to be developed by Melbourne House.\n\nCompared to the previous game, the improvement in graphics continued with three-dimensional stadiums (though players remained rendered as sprites). Cricketing legends Ritchie Benaud and Ian Botham for the first time provided commentary and also featured in full motion video interludes. The game did not feature real player names as with previous games in the series (with real Australian and English sides appearing for the first time in the game\u0027s successor, Ashes Tour Edition).",

The Wii Remote and Nunchuk are used for both movement and attacks, with motion controls incorporated for special attacks and finishing moves, while the tarantula also utilizes the pointer function to shoot webs. New abilities are also gained as the player progresses through the game.\nAlong with dispatching common arthropods such as pill bugs, crickets, beetles, and wolf spiders, most of which can be devoured to regain health, the player also faces bosses including a Gila Monster, a rattlesnake and eventually a human. The clashes between the creatures are described as similar to monster movies, with a similar impact to battles in King Kong and Jurassic Park albeit on a smaller scale.",

The game was published by Kemco; which was then known as Kotobuki System. \n \nThe plot apparently revolves around a robotic revolt led by a robot named De Gaulle. It is the year 2199 AD. By the explosions of global nuclear war, society has broken up into nine small expulsions, one of them disappeared and Venus collided with another celestial object. Humanity only slightly survived. Its thread of life barely connected to a body; which was rebuilt into a cyborg. The heroine is named Al Tiana and is also apparently a robot who does not support the rebellion. She is out to prove her loyalty to the humans.",

    "summary": "Floating Cloud God Saves the Pilgrims is a Playstation Mini game for PSP and Vita. \n \nFloating Cloud God Saves the Pilgrims is exactly that, a 2D shooter built around the eponymous deity (controlled by the player) and his quest to protect eight pilgrims in their journey across perilous territories. \n \nYour own shots just knock their hats off, but getting hit by anything else will kill a pilgrim and send their spirit floating off with a sad little wail. This is bad not only because the pilgrims are a de facto health bar (losing them all ends the game) but powering up Cloud God depends on harvesting their love - juicy little hearts that pop up whenever you kill an enemy and increase in size as you blast more. \n \nYou must get all of the love (given form as hearts) that they release, which then makes you much more powerful than you already are. You increase in size, look more menacing, and your attacks are more powerful. The pilgrims get the most excited when they witness ambushing ghosts and ghouls get annihilated by you. When they are excited, they produce more love, meaning more power to you. \n \nHowever, you have to be very careful when shooting. You grow weaker with every shot, so try not to channel your inner war-freak and have a little restraint, for the good of both yourself and the pilgrims. You also lose some of your steam if you get hit by enemy forces. And sometimes, the situation calls to for you to sacrifice your mightiness and provide cover to the pilgrims from the enemy assault with your own self. \n \nThere are two types of attack: the normal shot (by pressing X), and the bomb shot (by pressing Circle). The direction of the normal shot depends on what direction you are pressing, so there is some strategy to what part of the screen you should be shooting from. Being too far from your pilgrims is very dangerous but allows you to cover more ground, while launching a full frontal assault can protect your pilgrims by absorbing all the incoming fire. You have to think through, in real time, what tactics you would like to employ. You can always get in the middle, then rush forward, then get to a safe distance; mix and match, and you got yourself going. \n \nThe bomb shot is used if you are above the enemy. But that’s not all, as some enemies can’t be killed with the bomb shot, only with the normal shot, and vice versa. There are also enemies where you have to inflict bomb shot damage first before switching to the normal shot to take them out. \n \nEnemies are varied, and they look good, even if they are vile and evil. There are boss fights, too, to keep you on your toes. The Cloud God\u0027s powers and the heart system mesh so well that any enemy can be destroyed in a blink - so they\u0027ve got to be deceptive, sneaky, and sometimes numerous. Paper lanterns send out an arcing flame on death, red-eyed foxes hide in the scenery, imps swoop to carry off unlucky pilgrims and bobbing doll heads send out swarms of kisses. Hands start clawing up from the ground, crows dive-bomb your crew, and demons with phallic noses launch them as languorous, looping rockets. The cheeky oriental stylings are gorgeous, transforming symbols into everything from freaky momiji to dick-nosed devils. \n \nAs this suggests, one of the reasons Floating Cloud God is such a pleasure to play is its visual inventiveness, which has room enough for everything from Wario tributes to what looks like a crying poo. This big lump of a thing, which is introduced in a level called The Saddest Enemy, explodes into gobbets of mini-poo that are very useful for building up a heart multiplier. Perhaps they\u0027re babies? That would explain the sadness. \n \nFloating Cloud God has bags more where that came from, and despite the Minis tag has plenty of room to breathe (there are seven worlds with 27 stages, including boss fights). And it keeps on surprising. The controls are simplicity itself: left stick to move, one button to shoot and one to bomb. But you soon realise the subtlety of how shooting affects movement and vice-versa, which fairly soon you\u0027re depending on against every enemy pattern. The pilgrims, too, are loosely tied to Cloud God during some sections, and learning how to manage their momentum is another little learning curve. \n \nThe final touch is a minor detail that ties up everything. The pilgrims\u0027 hats can be improved. There\u0027s no in-game benefit to this, beyond looking much more awesome, and it\u0027s done by completing stages without losing a single pilgrim. Obviously, if you start this process on the first level and never lose a pilgrim, the hats just keep getting better. \n \nSeems like such a small thing, doesn\u0027t it? Soon nothing but a perfect run will do. The restart option is accessible, knowing, and tempting. Every time a pilgrim fell, it was too much to take - I didn\u0027t see their tiny spirit float off to heaven so much as all my future headwear ambitions. And to be fair, by that point I had four dudes with top hats, two with octopus heads and two with space hero helmets. You can\u0027t be replacing any of them with Norman and his brown cap just because some demon gets a lucky shot in. \n \nThat\u0027s the best thing about Floating Cloud God Saves the Pilgrims. You do want to save them, and not just because they represent \u0027health\u0027. The hats are a big part of it, but just as much is the sense of pride in being a badass god - harvesting power at the right moment to smash through oncoming waves, battling desperate rear-guard actions against hails of deadly kisses and throwing yourself in bodily as a last resort (which sometimes works!). The little yelp as a pilgrim goes down is a sharp reprimand, a blow to the daydreams of an all-conquering deity. \n \nThis description was compiled from the following reviews: \n \nhttp://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2012-04-19-floating-cloud-god-saves-the-pilgrims-review \n \nhttp://www.pspminis.com/8859/floating-cloud-god-saves-the-pilgrims-review-if-the-indication-of-a-good-game-is-a-lengthy-title-then-that-rule-applies-here/",

Supplies such as food and water can be found to battle the hunger and thirst. If the player fails to properly quench their hunger and thirst, the player\u0027s character will eventually die thus, continuing the cycle of life and death in the game.

    "summary": "In 1990, Softdisk Publishing publishes Dangerous Dave in the Deserted Pirate\u0027s Hideout! (also known as Dangerous Dave in Trophy Trouble, Dangerous Dave), a puzzle-solving game for the DOS system. Offering action genre, it is now an abandonware. \n \nOne of John Romero\u0027s earliest games before he became world-famous as one of id Software legends, Dangerous Dave is a fun platformer similar to Super Mario. You are Dangerous Dave, a little precocious kid who must find ten skateboarding trophies that your nemesis Clyde Cooper hid in a pirate\u0027s hideout. Gameplay in Dangerous Dave is nothing you haven\u0027t seen if you have played other platform games. What makes the game memorable and a lot of fun, however, are the many cool secret levels and the great sense of humor. Your enemies include creative monsters with names like WeirdWeeds, FearsomeFire, and WickedWater, all of which have unique attacks and characteristics. Level designs are excellent, showing much of Romero\u0027s knack that would become a hallmark in id Software games. With a lot of secret levels, humorous monsters and gags, and simple but fun gameplay, Dangerous Dave is a solid shareware game that paves the way for id blockbusters.",

    "summary": "SteamWorld Dig is 2D a platform game that revolves around mining for resources and ores. The objective of the game is to investigate the mines underneath the old Western town Tumbleton in order to unearth the secrets lurking below. The player controls Rusty who is equipped with a pickaxe but the player is given options to upgrade the tools used for digging as progression is made in the game. Besides health, the player also needs coal for light, and water for special abilities.\nSteamWorld Dig has platform elements in that the player runs, jumps and encounter foes, but the main objective is mining. That means that the player builds – or rather deconstructs – the game world and creates platforms that way. The player collects resources and other hidden resources which can be brought back to the surface and exchanged for cash. When the player progress in the game new abilities are unlocked. Each playthrough, the mines are randomized, making items and treasure appear in different locations. If the player gets stuck there is a self destruct function, but the players can also buy ladders in the store at the surface to get out of tricky situations.\nWhen progressing deeper down in the cave, the player encounters various enemies with different attack patterns and weak spots. The game features multiple worlds, each with a completely different environment. Dying results in a reparation penalty fee, and the player respawns back on the surface. All the loot that has been accumulated when the player dies can be picked up again.",

However, Conan is not the only character you can control in the game, beside him you can control Shin\u0027ichi\u0027s girlfriend Ran, her father, the renowned detective thanks to Conan, Kogoro, Ran\u0027s high-school girlfriend, Sonoko, and Conan\u0027s classmates Mitsuhiko, Ayumi and Genta. Based on the character you control, certain areas may be accessible or inaccessible, and certain dialogues and dispositions from other characters may vary. \n \nThe story starts with Togawa sisters, Satomi and Miki, receiving a golden statue. They lost their parents at an early age, never knowing what actually happened to them. One day, a letter came from a wealthy person living on an island somewhere in the western Japan Sea. Upon receiving this letter, they realized the golden statue belongs to the place from which the letter was sent. If this is a family heirloom, could the person who sent the letter be someone related to them? Can they know what happened to Satomi and Miki\u0027s parents? As Conan and the others opened the Togawa sisters\u0027 request, they decided to help uncover the mystery behind their lineage and golden statue and set off on a trip to the solitary island in question where ships travel to only twice a week. As they arrive on the island of strange shape, the notice the residents of an island village appear a bit weird, and there seem to be history behind the wealthy island family. And to top it all, the murder in front of the wealthy looking western-style estate occurred just in front on them and the murderer ran away from the scene of the crime. It\u0027s Conan\u0027s task to solve all the mysteries and catch the killer, for by his own words, the truth is always only one.",

    "summary": "Blue Estate is a darkly funny on-rails shooter ! Designed from the ground up to exploit the gyroscopic features of the new PlayStation4 controller, and Kinect moves sensor on Xbox One, Blue Estate offers slick wit and punishing violence through a genuinely fun and intuitive control system, all set in an eye-popping technicolor mob world.\n\nWhile experiencing the smoothness of motion control in a rail shooter, using the unique motion sensors capabilities of the PlayStation4 and Xbox One, the player will enter a fight for his life against the most absurd and dangerous enemies, ranging from scar covered fight-to-the-death champions to Tony\u0027s own hair and Chihuahuas that are too happy to see you. You\u0027re given a series of primary and secondary weapons to help make your way through the load of hilariously perilous missions. These will come in handy defeating the bosses who\u0027ll try to end your game and your life. But sometimes firepower isn\u0027t enough, so think before shooting and use cover to prepare your strategy, reload often, and try not to get turned into grated cheese.\n\nA killing spree is always better when shared, and that\u0027s why Blue Estate offers the opportunity for a second player to join the fun, through a cooperative mode where every headshot counts to show who\u0027s the best trigger in da house!",

Your only hope of gaining control over this world is to piece together your fragmented visions and confront your tormentors. \n \nAs any dream, however, this new reality is structured on the waking world, and understanding one necessitates understanding the other. \n \nThe dream world reveals itself in fragments.

The Gungeon has become a paradox and is collapsing! Armed with an ever-changing weapon, an insatiable need to loot, and the trusty dodge roll, each of our heroes must ascend and escape via their own unique route of increasingly perilous elevators. Battle against the last and most bitter of the Gundead at a frantic pace, slowing down just long enough to chat with some familiar faces… and a few new ones. Shifting rooms, enemies, bosses, bizarre weapons and items all combine to ensure that no two attempts to Exit the Gungeon are the same.",

You play as either Tenran or Aoi, a teenage boy and girl, respectively, on quest to defeat the ancient evil that threatens the prosperous land of Jipang, to prove themselves worthy of the legendary Fire Clan, warriors who have been protecting Jipang for many generations from evil demons and warlocks. The land Jipang is very similar to medieval Japan, and during your adventure you\u0027ll also visit Mongolia, China, and other Asian countries. \n \nThe most important new feature of the game is a non-linear storyline. You can tackle many missions in any order you want, and the storyline also changes depending on the outcome of major battles. If you lose against a boss enemy, the game is not over, but instead, a branching storyline path is revealed. Otherwise, the gameplay is similar to other Tengai Makyou games, featuring overworld map traveling and first person perspective, turn-based combat.",

Can your enemies guess your secret agenda?\n*HQs under AI control now have separate aggressiveness stances for Land, Air and Naval operations\n*Countries can request specific actions from their allies for unprecedented cooperation\n*Technological progress can now be shared with your allies\n*Brigades can now be upgraded to more advanced types (e.g. Infantry to Motorized, or Artillery to Self Propelled Artillery)\n*New 1940 scenario fills a gap in the game\u0027s timeline\n*Hundreds of new events added to immerse players in their own versions of World War II, comparing the unfolding alternate timeline to real history\n*Mighty warships can be designated the Pride of the Fleet, which is both an opportunity and a risk\n*The AI has been improved in all areas, at all levels. It will defend in depth, marshal big naval taskforces and launch multi-stage invasions. It will perform more historical diplomacy and pursue a strategic production strategy",

    "summary": "Based on the engine of Kingdoms of England, the game represents the same game, but flown now in the German lands. As its predecessor, the game is turn-based medieval strategy game for up to six humans or computer opponents. Each player assumes the role of a Lord in control of a Kingdom with up to twenty armies to command in an attempt to become Sole Ruler and King of Medieval Germany. \n \nFrom the very beginning of the game, you are placed in complex control of your kingdom. Using the mouse as controller and its cursor as your powerful finger, you must build your skills not only as the leader of a Campaign Army but skillfully manage the infrastructure of your kingdom. \n \nThere are two game scenarios: \nAgainst up to six human opponents. The scenario is based upon each player\u0027s ability to build his Kingdom into a society, which must prosper to enable the player to create the wealth to expand the growth required to increase the size and strength of his army, which will enable him to strategically conquer his opponents territory in his quest to become King of Germany. \n \n \nHead-to-head against computer opponents. In this scenario the human player must gain the skills as outlined in scenario one, but he is pitched against War Lords (up to five) who play by different rules, their aim is to gain wealth by conquest with no thought of development. They act as barbarians. It is up to human players to use the more constructive approach to outwit the computer player.",
