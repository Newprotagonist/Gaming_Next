There, the player soon realizes they have no memories, of course and the world in Life Forge is all new to them. From here, the players life is whatever they make it. A Life Forge, if you will.  \n  \nIn the world of Life Forge there is lots to do and be a part of. Players can become great and powerful heroes or, if they wish, villains and take part in quests, explore dungeons and have PvP battles in arenas. If a player decides they don't want to run around and take part in adventurous deeds then they won't have to. In Life Forge crafting is available as well, so If a player wishes then they can harvest all sorts of goods to create a variety of items. All of which they can either use for themselves or sell to other players. Guild and Player housing are also planned features for the game, giving players another little slice of variety and choices which will make their game play unique.​  \n  \n  \nFeatures:  \n  \nMount System  \n  \nUse mounts to travel faster!

Another big part of the game are wizarding duels: these take the form of a best-of-three bout, where the two wizards zap each other with magic while trying to evade the other's spells until one duelist's health is down.","videos":[{"id":54262,"video_id":"YeaE9NPfu2k"}]},{"id":117919,"cover":{"id":200810,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co4ay2.jpg"},"name":"Earth From Another Sun","platforms":[{"id":6,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"},{"id":167,"name":"PlayStation 5"},{"id":169,"name":"Xbox Series X|S"}],"screenshots":[{"id":704097,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scf3a9.jpg"},{"id":704098,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scf3aa.jpg"},{"id":704099,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scf3ab.jpg"},{"id":704100,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scf3ac.jpg"},{"id":704101,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scf3ad.jpg"},{"id":704102,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scf3ae.jpg"},{"id":704103,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scf3af.jpg"},{"id":704104,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scf3ag.jpg"},{"id":704105,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scf3ah.jpg"},{"id":704106,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scf3ai.jpg"},{"id":704107,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scf3aj.jpg"},{"id":704108,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scf3ak.jpg"}],"summary":"Explore the galaxy, establish and grow your empire, build your trade network, fight alongside the armies you command, and conquer the galaxy!

It was released in two countries: France and Japan.\n\nNapoleon is a Japanese Game Boy Advance launch title developed by Genki and published Nintendo. The game is a real-time strategy, a genre which rarely appeared on consoles at the time, let alone portable platforms. Instead of being an omnipotent being, however, Napoleon lets one play as the historical French leader himself as he rides on horseback to command his troops in battle. Contrary to what the name might imply, the game itself is not historically accurate, as its missions sometimes incorporate things such as monster summons which the player much take care of.\n\nNapoleon's gameplay simplifies a number of real-time strategy game conventions while adding some of its own unique traits. Resource gathering, for example, is not a part of the gameplay directly, although there are still limitations imposed on unit building. Troop morale is another factor which the player must take into consideration to ensure that Napoleon's lackeys are fighting optimally. Not only is this a factor in the actual battles themselves, where Napoleon can sometimes utter a war cry, but it's also a component of the game before and after battles, as the lower-ranked commanders Napoleon also brings into battle with him must be monitored for sufficient morale.\n\nAdditionally, Napoleon can only command his troops by going to each one individually, with the exception of the units which are grouped with another commander. In that case, simply telling the commander what to do is enough to get all of his attached units moving. He can also heal some units and also be healed by sub-commanders as well. Perhaps most importantly of all, though, is the fact that Napoleon's mobility is limited to how fast his horse can travel; any major parts of the battle he needs to attend to must be commuted to manually, instead of more instantaneous methods employed by most other real-time strategy games.","tags":[17,22,268435467,268435471,268435487,536870990,536871535,536871939,536872019,536872383,536875067,536875434,536876054,536876409,536878007,536880968],"videos":[{"id":57261,"video_id":"cmjSgttjjUA"}]},{"id":71409,"cover":{"id":91390,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co1yim.jpg"},"name":"Jane's USAF","platforms":[{"id":6,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}],"summary":"Jane's Combat Simulations: USAF - United States Air Force is a multi-aircraft simulator that is built upon the engine of its predecessor, Israeli Air Force. As with other titles using the Jane's license, the focus of the game is in creating a realistic and believable military aircraft simulation. Hence, the game's controls and mechanics are elaborate, while all controls can be mapped to a voice command. It is also possible to give basic commands to wingmen, if they are present. While waypoints and refueling can be managed by the aircraft's autopilot, all such maneuvers can be done manually. \n \nUSAF is based on 8 different fighters and bombers of the United States Air Force: the F-4E Phantom II, F-105D Thunderchief, A-10A Thunderbolt II, F-15C Eagle, F-15E Strike Eagle, F-16C Fighting Falcon, F-117A Nighthawk, and the F-22A Raptor. In game modes other than the campaign, the MiG-29 is also available to the player. Each aircraft performs differently and is meant for different tasks, and can be seen from the cockpit (with 2D and 3D views available, and the possibility to look around from the pilot's perspective), from the outside (in a behind view or one of the cinematic views), or with just the HUD visible. \n \nThe game has four campaigns, two of which are historical (Vietnam War and Desert Storm), and the other two (Red Arrow and Sleeping Giant) being fictional and set in a hypothetical future. Tutorials are extensive, while separate tutorials exist under the umbrella term \"Red Flag\", which note more demanding tasks and can not be reached at the lowest rank. The player's progress and rank is recorded in their profile, with each mission's success or failure affecting their score. Scoring itself can be changed by setting various difficulties and \"aids\", with AI help removing score percentages but making the game easier for newcomers. \n \nAside from the campaigns, there are preset single scenarios, as well as a quick mission editor which the player can use to manually set the parameters of a desired air-to-air skirmish (whereas the campaigns have both air-to-ground and air-to-air missions). There is also a Fly Now! button in the main menu, which randomly picks a mission from a small mission pool and puts the player in a random plane. These missions can have the same settings/landscapes as the missions in the campaigns: United States (Nellis Air Force base), Germany, Vietnam, and Iraq. The game comes bundled with a User Mission Editor application as well. USAF has a multiplayer mode available via LAN and JanesCombat.Net (which has since been discontinued). \n \nFinally, the signature feature of Jane's-licensed games is the in-game encyclopaedia, which is present in USAF and lists and describes in detail not only the aircraft the player can pilot or shoot at, but also all other objects that can be encountered in the game, as well as missiles that aircraft can be armed with.","tags":[268435469,536871470,536871475,536872060]},{"id":42746,"cover":{"id":115938,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co2hgi.jpg"},"name":"Storm Lover Kai!!","platforms":[{"id":38,"name":"PlayStation Portable"}],"screenshots":[{"id":757798,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scg8py.jpg"}],"summary":"Storm Lover is a tempest that blows itself into the world of otome dating sims.

New Age Shutsudou is a semi-port/remake of Ganbare Goemon: Shin Sedai Shuumei, containing similar levels and plot to the PlayStation title. New Age Shutsudou was developed and published by Konami Corporation in 2002. The game (as well as Shin Sedai Shuumei) gives the Goemon universe a facelift. It takes place in futuristic Japan, Goemon is skinnier and sports a new hair-do, Ebisumaru is replaced with a shy girl who has a crush on Goemon named Ebisu, and Yae is replaced with Yui, a mermaid-like creature.\n\nThe Impact scenes take place inside of a large mech.\nIn terms of gameplay, Goemon: New Age Shutsudou! is a fairly traditional side-scrolling action platformer. The player controls either Goemon or Ebisu, attacking enemies with their respective weapons (which can be leveled up three times in terms of power), and gathering coins. Each level is fairly linear in comparison to earlier Ganbare Goemon titles, and at the end of each level the player is taken to a world map.\n\nSome levels differentiate from this formula. These levels put the player in control of different characters. There are side-scrolling shoot-em-up stages starring characters like Sasuke. The weapon power-up system still works identically here, the gameplay style is just shifted. Additionally, there are stages where the player takes control of Yui, a mermaid-like creature. These stages are underwater.\n\nNew Age Shutsudou marks the return of the first person Impact scenes, which were previously in some of the Super Famicom Goemon games. These scenes put the player in control of a large mech, fighting other robots. The mech is immobile, but is able to melee attack, guard, and fire counter-attacking lasers.","tags":[1,268435464,536870973,536870990,536871306,536872961,536873370,536876985,536885037]},{"id":123772,"cover":{"id":173696,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co3q0w.jpg"},"name":"Necrofugitive","platforms":[{"id":6,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}],"screenshots":[{"id":339276,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc79sc.jpg"},{"id":339277,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc79sd.jpg"},{"id":339278,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc79se.jpg"},{"id":339279,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc79sf.jpg"},{"id":339280,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc79sg.jpg"}],"summary":"Necrofugitive is a brutal 2D action platformer about the prison escape of an evil shapeshifter and his attempts to evade the realm's justice.

It is the first video game in the Carnivores series.\n\nThe player takes the role of a DinoHunt customer. At the start of a new game, the player must register a new hunter or continue with a saved hunter. The point of the game is hunting dinosaurs to get trophies and accumulate score. Each dinosaur represents a set number of points. A novice hunter starts with zero points, when his points increase he'll be able to hunt new dinosaurs on additional terrains with more powerful weapons. If the player is killed by a dinosaur, all points accumulated on that specific hunt are forfeited. The player must be picked up by DinoHunt to keep the points he earned.\n\nA hunter will become Advanced after earning 100 points, and Expert with 300. To begin a hunt, the player must choose the location, the weapon, the dinosaur and some hunting accessories which help the player but will deduct the score during that hunt. Each location is unique, with varying difficulties and terrain. The new hunter will be given three areas, with two more added for the Advanced hunter and a final area for the Expert hunter, for a total of six locations. Level locations include jungles, and deserts accompanied by pyramids and an ancient temple.\n\nNext, the player must choose a dinosaur to hunt. A new hunter will be given the choice of four dinosaurs: Parasaurolophus, Stegosaurus, Pachycephalosaurus and Allosaurus. An Advanced hunter gains the ability to hunt the Triceratops and the Velociraptor. Only an Expert hunter can hunt the Tyrannosaurus rex. Harmless creatures such as Moschops, Gallimimus and Dimorphodon are present in each level. They are worth zero points and can be killed with a single shot.\n\nThe player must also choose a weapon, which can be set for kill or tranquilize for additional points. A beginning hunter can only use a shotgun or a crossbow. A sniper rifle is unlocked upon becoming an Advanced hunter. First time hunters can use the Observation Mode to familiarize themselves with dinosaur behavior and different terrain.","tags":[1,18,22,268435461,268435469,268435470,536870976,536870999,536871365,536871377,536871882,536872031,536872033,536872060,536872078,536872282,536872448,536872586,536872708,536872983,536874538,536875358,536875483,536875643,536876262,536876706,536877501],"videos":[{"id":5217,"video_id":"EB01bu_vpEI"},{"id":43941,"video_id":"hht0Abiw8j4"}]},{"id":65664,"cover":{"id":131886,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co2tri.jpg"},"name":"Hello Kitty to Issho: Block Crash V","platforms":[{"id":46,"name":"PlayStation Vita"}]},{"id":49043,"cover":{"id":111069,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co2dp9.jpg"},"name":"The New Chessmaster","platforms":[{"id":33,"name":"Game Boy"}],"summary":"Say goodbye to lost pieces and slow opponents.

Sir Daniel Fortesque can use a variety of weapons, consisting of close range weapons such as swords and clubs to long range weapons such as crossbows. Many of these weapons can be charged for a powerful attack and some weapons, such as the club, can be used to access areas that are otherwise inaccessible. When not possessing any items, Dan is able to rip his own arm off and use it for both melee and ranged attacks. Dan can equip a shield alongside weapons to defend against attacks; though they can only take several hits of damage before breaking. Throughout the game, Dan can visit gargoyle heads of two varieties; green ones offer Dan information while blue ones allow Dan to buy services or ammunition by using the treasures he finds.\n\nDan's health is determined by a single health bar, which reduces when Dan is hit. It will deplete completely if Dan drowns or falls from a great height. If Dan completely runs out of health, the game will end. Dan can extend his maximum health by collecting Life Bottles, which will automatically refill his health bar if it drops to zero. Also hidden throughout the game are Life Vials and Life Fountains that can replenish Dan's health and fill up any empty Life Bottles Dan has. In each level, there is a hidden Chalice of Souls, which can be collected if the player fills it with enough souls from defeated enemies (some Chalices are awarded via other means). If the player clears a level with a Chalice in hand, Dan is warped to the Hall of Heroes, where he can speak to a legendary hero who will give him rewards, such as weapons. If the player finishes the game with all the Chalices, the game's true ending is revealed.","tags":[1,17,19,22,27,268435464,268435465,268435481,268435487,536870928,536871063,536871123,536871138,536871139,536871208,536871213,536871244,536871262,536871610,536871931,536871939,536872010,536872032,536872232,536872649,536872961,536873024,536873066,536873079,536873154,536873326,536873384,536873473,536873787,536874706,536875042,536875067,536875073,536875081,536875131,536875152,536875197,536875199,536875271,536875284,536875319,536875331,536875372,536875398,536875452,536875453,536875485,536875536,536875575,536875609,536875638,536875639,536875677,536875699,536875755,536875803,536875808,536875825,536875870,536876007,536876010,536876032,536876120,536876240,536876479,536876539,536876560,536876570,536876607,536876678,536876706,536876770,536876816,536876862,536877579,536877996,536878034,536878323,536878360,536880292,536880692,536880810,536880925,536883164,536883622,536883630,536884021,536884022,536884032,536884033,536884863],"videos":[{"id":5374,"video_id":"-A4VTi2IXZA"}]},{"id":115771,"cover":{"id":71997,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co1jjx.jpg"},"name":"HiQ Ace","platforms":[{"id":48,"name":"PlayStation 4"}],"summary":"In the puzzle race become the HiQ Ace. \n \nEnjoy the high quality classic jigsaw puzzle game with the arcade twist. \n \nMaster your mind and sharpen your eyes to be the jigsaw puzzle master - the HiQ Ace. \n \nUnlock two additional game modes.

The screen scrolls automatically, only stopping to fight major enemies. The screen features six continuous platforms that occasionally feature small gaps. Sonson and Tonton walk automatically across these platforms. Pressing up or down will cause them to jump up or down to the next platform. Pressing left causes them to move more slowly than the screen scrolls, essentially continuing to move forward but at a reduced pace. Pressing right does the opposite - SonSon and TonTon will move across the platforms faster than the screen scrolls. The duo have only one attack - the ability to fire energy blasts from their stalves. Touching an enemy or an unfriendly projectile causes the player to lose a life. If a player has any additional lives, they will return to the screen riding on a cloud that will give them temporary invincibility. If the player presses the control stick in any direction, the cloud will disappear and the character will resume its usual walking mode. The cloud will eventually disappear on its own if the control stick is not used.\n\nPower-ups come in the form of various fruits which produce points (with enough points giving the player an extra life). Gathering certain fruit will cause all enemies currently on a screen to turn into point-bearing fruits. Walking across certain platforms will randomly cause a bamboo shoot to sprout, yielding many extra points.\n\nIt is possible to play the game co-operatively with partner who plays as TonTon (who is Zhu Wuneng in the original story).","tags":[1,268435464,268435489,536871075,536871937,536872591,536873064,536876634,536894378],"videos":[{"id":23986,"video_id":"n-JMw_qYrYk"}]},{"id":98205,"cover":{"id":190921,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co43bd.jpg"},"name":"Waku Waku Volley","platforms":[{"id":7,"name":"PlayStation"}]},{"id":84598,"cover":{"id":65964,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/zrjq1fanui3btikl5lk8.jpg"},"name":"Monster Strike","platforms":[{"id":37,"name":"Nintendo 3DS"}],"summary":"Monster Strike is a 3DS iteration of the popular smartphone game from mixi.

It’s a mesmerizing fairytale, but the creepy-cute tough-as-nails Scarygirl is no damsel in distress.","tags":[1,268435464,536871874,536873810,536878512,536888127,536890733,536892240,536892241]},{"id":49703,"name":"Mail de Cute","platforms":[{"id":24,"name":"Game Boy Advance"}],"summary":"Mail de Cute is an Adventure game, published by Konami, which was released in Japan in 2002.","tags":[268435487]},{"id":118899,"cover":{"id":219533,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co4pe5.jpg"},"name":"Strange Brigade: Deluxe Edition","platforms":[{"id":49,"name":"Xbox One"}],"screenshots":[{"id":782532,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scgrt0.jpg"},{"id":782533,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scgrt1.jpg"},{"id":782534,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scgrt2.jpg"},{"id":782535,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scgrt3.jpg"},{"id":782536,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scgrt4.jpg"},{"id":782537,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scgrt5.jpg"},{"id":782538,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scgrt6.jpg"},{"id":782539,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scgrt7.jpg"},{"id":782540,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scgrt8.jpg"},{"id":782541,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scgrt9.jpg"}],"summary":"Upgrade your Strange Brigade experience with the DELUXE EDITION, which includes the game, the Season Pass, and the Secret Service Weapons Pack!\nSeteki the Witch Queen has risen once again, and only one troop of daring heroes can stand against her fearsome army of mummified monstrosities: The Strange Brigade!\nExplore remarkable ruins, solve perilous puzzles and uncover tantalising treasure while blasting your way through an array of undead enemies in thrilling third-person action!"},{"id":138935,"cover":{"id":114857,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co2gmh.jpg"},"name":"Codename: Room","platforms":[{"id":6,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}],"screenshots":[{"id":400266,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc8kui.jpg"},{"id":400267,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc8kuj.jpg"},{"id":400268,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc8kuk.jpg"},{"id":400269,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc8kul.jpg"},{"id":400270,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc8kum.jpg"},{"id":400271,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc8kun.jpg"},{"id":400272,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc8kuo.jpg"},{"id":400273,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc8kup.jpg"}],"summary":"Codename: Room is an experimental puzzle game inspired by Portal and The Stanley Parable. In it, players are placed into a single room covered with gray tiles. This room is not what it seems, however. This room can make images appear on the walls and create the illusion that you're in a place that you're actually not. Many things can happen in the room and it's up to the players to decide how far they'll go. Once players are inside the room, a mysterious voice will come in and be mysterious. He will inform the player that they're part of an experiment that revolves around the room. The player will then have to complete several challenges that involve both platforming and puzzle-solving skills. The mysterious voice will then judge the player's performance which will determine what ending the player gets (good, bad, or something in-between). \n \nThe demo for the game is currently available to download on Itch.io. A single run of the game will take about 10 minutes to complete but players are encouraged to play through the game multiple times due to the fact that the game has multiple endings as well as various other secrets and easter eggs.","tags":[27,43,268435465,536871068,536871132,536871220,536872225,536872227,536872423,536872609,536875199]},{"id":9049,"aggregated_rating":62.5,"cover":{"id":22391,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/cptzi0hmqjmuotx0gbne.jpg"},"name":"The Sun at Night","platforms":[{"id":6,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}],"screenshots":[{"id":93398,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/utequz2ijy1ec8ililcd.jpg"},{"id":93399,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/kiqczhgughivqryf7l12.jpg"},{"id":93400,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/vh93tkupzgfl3sfnafrt.jpg"},{"id":93401,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/ziocilzkclqhvkos8zt1.jpg"},{"id":93402,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/oqab6zrm12hpoecgwzqi.jpg"}],"summary":"Explore, blast, and shield your way through massive branching levels as Laika the space dog.
