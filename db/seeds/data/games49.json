The most obvious difference from real baseball is that some of the characters in this game are robots. All the human characters are equipped with powerful armor, computer sensors, and jet-packs for improved offense and defensive skills.",

But if you can\u0027t recruit them, create them with the Create-A-Player mode. This year\u0027s version also has improved AI, so you can expect some serious competition from some of the better schools.

The player now finds herself in a seemingly hostile town where one mystery seems to just stack on another... \n \nWild Season Build v0.5.4.14 just went live and on early access on Steam! Read about it at http://bit.ly/buildupdate-0-5-4-15 \n \nFor more news and updates, like them on facebook.com/WildSeasonTheGame",

Each puzzle here has been lovingly hand-crafted by Mark Goodliffe and Simon Anthony, the hosts of Cracking The Cryptic. They\u0027ve even included their own hints on each puzzle to help if you get stuck. Mark and Simon have both represented the UK many times in the World Sudoku Championship.",

In the game you and a friend play as a pair of loose-cannon police partners, given twenty-four hours to crack a case as part of an elite organised crime taskforce.\n\nPlanning is tactical rather than strategic, players must react in the moment to shootouts as they unfurl, with additional extra time to assess the situation if they are able to surprise their adversaries. Ammo and enemies are plentiful, and combat is punchy and impactful, supported by an extensive destruction system that ensures every shot looks and feels great.",

At some point, a flaming blue fireball, mech mortar rocket, or giant spike of doom is going to hit you in the face, and you’re going to die. That’s when the fun begins.\n\nWhen you die, you’ll leave behind an Echo of your hero on the battlefield. The next hero in line will be able to resurrect your Echo as an AI battle companion. Take turns continuing each other’s games, fighting and dying with friends until you have an entire army of Echoes by your side. Everyone dies. Heroes continue.\n\nNext Up Hero is a 2D action adventure driven by Community Continue. Next Up Hero is inspired by friends taking turns at the arcade to beat unfairly difficult games, and designed so beating a session is a shared victory and more fun than playing on your own.\n\nChoose from nine heroes with an assortment of weapons and abilities to suit your playstyle, from swords and rocket launchers to laser turrets, bongo drums, and boomerangs. Coming this fall, Heroes who complete feats of greatness will gain entry into the Champions Trials, a monthly contest in which Digital Continue throws the hardest monsters they have at you.\n\nDeveloped with community feedback, beginning with an exclusive closed beta at RTX this summer and moving to Steam Early Access in the fall, Digital Continue will incorporate community ideas to improve characters, gameplay, weapons, attacks, and enemy types for the final game.\n\nNext Up Hero is the first game from Digital Continue, founded by Joe Tringali, the co-founder of 5TH Cell, creators of Scribblenauts, Lock’s Quest and Drawn to Life.\n\nFeatures\n\nChampions Trial (Early Access only) - Collect and spend Grand Tokens to gain access to the Champions Trial. These connected adventures will be unique each month. Each Grand Token earns you a single play, so choose your character wisely, and work together with the community to solve puzzles, defeat challenging enemies, and unlock new rewards!\n\nJournal System - Customize and track your own accomplishments stylized like Mad Libs to earn Grand Tokens!\n\nSpotlight Sessions and Leaderboards - Compete with the Community via Daily, Weekly and Monthly Leaderboards! Participate in a Session with your favorite Streamer or Celebrity in VIP Sessions!\n\nAsynchronous Co-Op - Engage in a cutting edge style of cooperative play, Community Continue, where beating community sessions is a shared achievement, and more fun than playing on your own.\n\nCharacter Customization - Defeat enemies to acquire their abilities to combine with your character of choice for thousands of potential deadly loadouts!\n\nAbility-based Progression - Hunt and defeat dozens of monsters to master their abilities on your way to eternal glory!",

It was one of the first Sailor Moon-related video games to be released.\n\nIn this game, the player controlled Usagi Tsukino/Sailor Moon. The storyline was based on the first, third, and fourth episodes of the first season of the anime. Although they originally had not yet appeared in those episodes, in the game Usagi could meet and talk to Ami and Rei, who were NPCs (non-player characters).\n\nThe three levels were divided into two parts. First, Usagi could walk through the city, school or a health spa, occassionally talking to people. After talking to the right people, Usagi turned into Sailor Moon and entered another kind of level in which she fought numerous enemies.\n\nBy default, Sailor Moon could only use kicking attacks. Pressing the \"down\" button would make Sailor Moon sit down and cry, and if there were rocks on the wall nearby, her high-pitched crying would make the rocks explode and drop special items. These items gave different powers: one enabled her to use Moon Tiara Action for a limited number of times, one made her invincible for a short amount of time, etc.\n\nThe bosses were Morga, Kyurene, Jadeite, and Queen Beryl. Sailor Moon actually had to fight Jadeite each time after defeating the two Youma, and at the end of the last level, had to fight him again before facing Queen Beryl.",

Every vikings and civilians are fragile to every strike from a thrown object and will be knocked out in one hit. Each time an object collides with a figure, they\u0027re knocked out and excluded from the group, but larger or wide objects may even knock out an entire group, resulting in the player being eliminated. Lost civilians can be replaced by recruiting stray people roaming field. The game also features special items to be thrown such as explosive bombs for an area of effect attack.",

In dynasty mode, you can build your team from the ground up, even adding junior-college prospects to your roster. If you\u0027re more interested in quick-and-dirty action, play in situation mode where you create the scenario--even putting two minutes on the clock and your team within field-goal range.

    "summary": "The Gosling valley was once a valley of peace and prosperity. In Gosling it seemed the sun always shined, your neighbors smiled, and the harvests were bountiful. Yes, life in the valley was good. Factor in the mushrooms, and well, life wasn\u0027t just good, it was great! \n \nAh yes, the mushrooms. The valley was full of them, and each one was special. There were enormous mushrooms that were used as homes, and small ones that could be brewed into liquor (including everyone\u0027s tavern favorite, ShroOOom! ale). Some mushrooms were best buttered and fried, while other mushrooms were typically dried and smoked. There were mushrooms that healed the sick, and even some that could make magic! \n \nThen the troubles began. Bizarre creatures prowled the valley, the wildlife fled, and once full larders laid bare. The citizens of Gosling smiled at each other no more, instead spending their days hiding in terror. Worse, with the blight upon the land the mushrooms that once provided so much now provided so little. Even the casks of ShroOOom! ale were almost dry! \n \nBig Will, an old farmer, sought out the source of the evil. Nestled high in the hills, he found the source: a dank and dark cave that oozed evil, a terrible open sore in the land that spewed forth nightmares. Big Will did not go in, though. He\u0027d let someone else have all the glory. Someone, such as YOU! \n \nYou are Rapius, mighty farm laborer. The blood of the Gods do not flow in your veins. You were not prophesized about a thousand years prior by three blind crones. Yet it is you, Rapius, that will seek out and destroy the source of evil. \n \nRapius, grab your lantern and make haste! For the good of the people, the lands, and the mushrooms - especially the mushrooms! Have you seen what they\u0027re charging for a pint of ShroOOm! ale lately? Go forth, descend into the earth! Leave a tramp and come back a scallywag! All of Gosling awaits your triumph - your triumph in the lair of the Medusa! \n \nScallywag: In the Lair of the Medusa is a single-player, action orientated dungeonbash of unlimited potential. Taking the role of Rapius players fight their way through eighty levels of randomly generated dungeon exploration, braving dozens of unique subterranean dangers in a quest to cleanse the ultimate evil within the catacombs. \n \nDown in the dark players will gain gear, craft items, learn magic, eat \u0027shrooms, turn to stone, become invisible, get drunk, be hungover, learn to fly, speed up, muscle up, regenerate, smoke fungus, get diseased, get lost, get found, and more! Careful use of Rapius\u0027 lantern will allow players to strike from afar, or for tough encounters, sneak by silently in the dark. \n \nScallywag: In the Lair of the Medusa also comes complete with RAGe, the Random Adventure Game engine. Craft whole new adventures for Rapius, or even make entirely new games! Everything (and we mean everything) can be modded with RAGe, no programming experience necessary! \n \nDo you have what it takes to survive eighty levels of terrible beasts, cruel hazards, and some mind blowing mushrooms? Find out in Scallywag: In the Lair of the Medusa!",

Dropaway cockpits, remastered audio and improved joystick options were among the list of improvements. The biggest selling point was native speed-limited support for Windows. Initial sales were low because many fans still readily had computers running DOS to play older Wing Commander games. The game received a second printing in 1998, but many fans were still hesitant to rebuy games they already owned. By the turn of the century however, a huge shift from DOS to Windows had occurred and everyone was scrambling to get a copy. Although the July 2000 edition of PC Gamer included the Kilrathi Saga version of Wing Commander I on its cover disc, auction prices on eBay soared to well over $300 for the full set. Wing Commander fans struggled to find copies until 2005 and the improvement DOS emulation. Although Kilrathi Saga has exciting extras, minor glitches and the solid performance of the original Wing Commander games in DOSBox has relieved the intense price pressure on the game. \n \n  Noteworthy Documentation: Manual, Concept Art Calendar \n  Play: The game can be played by enabling Windows 95 compatibility mode in Windows XP \n  Kilrathi Saga owners may download The Secret Missions and Special Operations",

In the main campaign, players start as a fresh rookie pilot, newly transfered to England. Players can have conversations with other pilots,check the kill board for the entire squadron or commence the next mission. Missions begin with a briefing explaining the objectives and then players are put in the front seat of their aircraft. They must take off, reach the appropriate waypoints, perform the objective and return home to land. All planes have a machine gun, of varying capacities , which fires in front of the plane. Some planes are also able to carry bombs. There is no radar or other detection method on the planes, so players must be alert to oncoming enemies.",

As hostilities died out, more trivial concerns like rebuilding what was lost or dealing with space piracy, became the biggest concerns of the Terran Confederation. Even Christopher \"Maverick\" Blair, the famous Confed pilot responsible for ending the war, settled down and became a farmer. In these times of peace, humans grew fat and complacent. All good things must end, though. Soon enough, heinous incidents erupted on the outskirts of the Confederation, and humanity was forced to the brink of civil war. Confed HQ needed the best and decided to recall Colonel Blair to active duty. This is where you come in.\n\nWing Commander 4 is one of the greatest space sims of all time, and some even consider it the greatest one of all. It is one of those games that did everything right. This is one of the few games that actually successfully manages to integrate a lot of FMV into the action, mostly because it uses trained film actors and directors. The combat is straightforward, fluid, and entertaining. The characters are as believable and memorable as they come. The orchestrated music -- just perfect. Finally, its enthralling story is both deep and plausible -- a combination that is often lost in modern games. There is simply no reason not to play this game and, once you do start playing, you will find it hard to think of a reason why you should stop."

Your tasks will range from seek-and-find missions to all out assaults, from espionage to dramatic defenses. With dozens of weapons at your disposal, you’ll be fighting against everything from helicopters to infantry, armored cars to enemy tanks, fortifications to biomechs. \n \nThe environments have been set up to be non-linear and entirely interactive. Drive where-ever you wish, crushing trees and blasting the wildlife, trashing skyscrapers, leaving tank-tracks and the bloody remains of your foes in the sand. The pyrotechnics aren’t just limited to big explosions (though there are plenty of those), as flamethrowers leave trees ablaze and foes running screaming as they burn.",

    "summary": "“Iron Sky: Invasion” is a space fighter simulator, calling to mind such classics as the legendary... You-Know-Which series - further enhanced with strategy and RPG elements. The core of the gameplay is based on ship-to-ship dogfights, combined with assaults on giant spaceships (such as the Siegfried-Class Zeppelins), as well as tactical thinking and resource management. \n \nThe game is set in outer space, where the players must defend the Earth from the invasion of the Moon Nazis. The players control spaceships to freely roam the space and attack Nazi vessels; various weapons and equipment are at their disposal, from laser cannons and missiles to handy drones and satellites which can be launched from certain ships. The vessels are also equipped with military countermeasures, to protect them from enemy fire. \n \nThe players can access a tactical map of outer space to spot the positions of Nazi forces or any ongoing battles, and thus instantly know where to fly. The ultimate goal is to destroy the secret Nazi base hidden on the Dark Side of the Moon and to keep the Earth safe from the invading spacecraft. \n \nBeing based on the cult movie, the “Iron Sky: Invasion” comes with a touch of politics as well: various nations will offer unique missions, yet to accept or refuse them is up to the player. Some missions tempt the players with special rewards, such as precious upgrades or even brand new ships. \n \nThe players can dock at an allied space station to recharge weapons, purchase upgrades or even switch ships. Almost all spaceships that appear in the film can be controlled in game (except for the largest one), including the South-Korean scout ship “Zerg”, the Australian bomber “Dundee”, or the UK fighter “Spitfire”. The availability of some will depend on the completion of certain missions. \n \nThe ships’ sub-systems can be further upgrade in the hangar: for example, upgrading the offensive systems will increase the number of weapons and boost their power, while an engine upgrade will improve the ship’s speed and range of interception. Upgrades require special resources, which can be scavenged from destroyed enemy units or found in outer space.",

Like Air Combat, there are various missions to conquer (over six in all). There are stealth missions requiring you to avoid radar, bombing, and missile raids, and straight-up dogfights. Resistance comes in the form of other aircraft, sea cruisers, ground turrets, and missiles. \n \nYour plane has the ability to detect enemies on radar, fire various missile weapons, and cloak itself from radar (very handy for those stealth missions). In order to survive, each feature must be utilized and learned by the player. Certain objectives require the use of heat-seeking missiles and strategy. If you go in with guns and missiles blazing, in all likelihood, you\u0027ll get shot out of the sky.",
