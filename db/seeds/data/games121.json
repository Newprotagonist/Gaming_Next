Despite earlier rumors of a downgraded port due to the PlayStation 2's hardware limitations, impressions of the port based on a preview build have been generally favorable.\n\nAdditionally, almost all the GameCube's real-time cut scenes were converted into movie files in order to maintain a better quality. This results in the player's character appearing wearing their default costume, regardless of which accessories or outfits were actually chosen. Furthermore, voices and sound effects quality outside of the cut-scenes had been reduced due to disc space being quickly used and audio RAM constraints.\n\nTo compensate for the late release, Capcom added new content made specifically for the PlayStation 2 release:\n- Separate Ways (The Another Order in Japan), a five chapter minigame which revolves around Ada Wong's involvement in Resident Evil 4, and her connection to Albert Wesker, a former member of the Raccoon City's\n- S.T.A.R.S. division, who is now attempting to revive Umbrella. During the minigame, the player can use two exclusive weapons (a pump-action shotgun and a bowgun with explosive arrows).\n- Ada's Report, a five-part documentary, which analyzes Ada's relationship with a particular character and their role in the plot. One unlocks portions of the documentary as they progress through the Separate Ways minigame.\n- New costume set, which portrays Leon as a 1930s mobster, and puts Ashley in an indestructible suit of armor. If equipped while Leon is in his Mobster costume, the Chicago Typewriter turns into the 1928 model, with a drum magazine as opposed to the regular box magazine. Since the Chicago Typewriter has infinite ammo, and thus no need to reload, hitting the reload button while in the mobster costume and aiming the Chicago Typewriter will result in a \"taunt\" from Leon, one in which he adjusts his hat, the other he throws the hat into the air, catching it while posing. In addition to the Mobster and Knight outfits Leon can be equipped with a Raccoon City police uniform with Ashley wearing a somewhat revealing pop-star outfit.\n- P.R.L. 412 (Plaga Removal Laser), a laser gun which can be used to instantly destroy enemies. Unlocked by beating the Professional difficulty setting.\n- Movie Browser, a feature that allows the player to view cutscenes from the both Separate Ways and the main game. The feature is unlocked after a player beats the game.\n- Amateur mode, an easier difficulty setting which is exclusive to the Japanese and Spanish versions.","tags":[1,19,21,268435461],"videos":[{"id":47213,"video_id":"tSbf7PfpV6I"}]},{"id":44855,"cover":{"id":115128,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co2gu0.jpg"},"name":"Wipeout 3 Special Edition","platforms":[{"id":7,"name":"PlayStation"}],"summary":"Wipeout 3 is a racing game that retains the same basic elements of its predecessors, and introduces players to the F7200 Anti-Gravity Race League.

When the player character finds he has been put under the spell of the Dragon Cauldron by a dark faction, making him a mere puppet forced to kill, he ventures forth to settle the score.\"","tags":[1,17,268435464,268435481,268435488,536870973,536871501,536875043,536875046,536875066],"videos":[{"id":15591,"video_id":"iCe6IjwUx2M"},{"id":15962,"video_id":"ZfqH8HMxbyM"}]},{"id":51837,"cover":{"id":142685,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co323h.jpg"},"name":"The Manhole: Masterpiece Edition","platforms":[{"id":6,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"},{"id":14,"name":"Mac"},{"id":39,"name":"iOS"}],"screenshots":[{"id":486068,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scaf1w.jpg"},{"id":486069,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scaf1x.jpg"},{"id":486070,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scaf1y.jpg"},{"id":486071,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scaf1z.jpg"},{"id":486072,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scaf20.jpg"},{"id":486073,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scaf21.jpg"}],"summary":"The Manhole Masterpiece Edition is a remake of the classic hypercard based game The Manhole, one of the first of Cyan (later Cyan Worlds) games.

Unlike previous Lego games in which players had to advance through the story in a linear order, players can now choose to start the game from any of the main Skywalker Saga episodes and complete them in any order they wish. Each episode has their own hub filled with planets featured prominently in each respective film that can be visited and explored. Each episode will have five story missions each, a total of 45 levels.\n\nCombat has also been revamped, such as lightsaber fights now involving a variety of combos with light attacks, heavy attacks, and Force moves, and blaster characters having an over-the-shoulder camera angle featured in many third-person shooter games.\n\nRandom encounters will also happen in the game's hub. For example, an Imperial Star Destroyer will suddenly jump out of hyperspace and send a fleet of TIE Fighters after the player. Players can choose to engage in dogfights with them or continue onward to progress the story. The game will have more than 200 playable characters, though TT Games has said that number will change.","tags":[1,18,27,268435465,268435487,536871154,536871287,536871322,536871808,536871886,536872001,536872056,536872164,536872549,536873020,536875199,536875835,536875838,536875847,536875848,536876269,536876901,536877195,536877197,536877406,536880376,536881073,536881074,536881717,536884212,536889639,536894955,536897877,536903466,536903467,536903468],"videos":[{"id":40019,"video_id":"oz_v35svV40"},{"id":63496,"video_id":"HKYhNwzBA8w"},{"id":66203,"video_id":"3p1vilvb4Ck"}]},{"id":126594,"cover":{"id":90897,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co1y4x.jpg"},"name":"Whateverland","platforms":[{"id":6,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}],"screenshots":[{"id":354535,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc7lk7.jpg"},{"id":354536,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc7lk8.jpg"},{"id":354537,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc7lk9.jpg"},{"id":354538,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc7lka.jpg"},{"id":354539,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc7lkb.jpg"},{"id":354540,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc7lkc.jpg"}],"summary":"Welcome to Whateverland, a prison for lost souls, where everyone gets what they truly deserve!

Even though set in Frank Herbert's famous Dune universe, the game is only loosely connected to the plot of any of the books or the films based from them. Controlling either of the three Houses, the player must fight a number of battles against the other Houses. In the early levels, the goal is simply to earn a certain number of credits, while in the later missions, all enemies must be destroyed.\n\nThe single resource in the game is the Spice, which must be collected by harvesters. The spice is converted to credits in a refinery, which are then spent to construct additional buildings and units. There are two terrain types: buildings can only be constructed on stone, while the Spice is only found on sand. However, units moving on sand attract the large sandworms of Dune, who are virtually indestructible and can swallow even large units whole. As levels progress, new and more advanced buildings and units are made available, including structures like a radar station, a repair facility or defense turrets and, for units, various ground troops, light vehicles and tanks. Each House can construct one unique special unit, and, after building a palace improvement, can unleash a unique palace effect.","tags":[18,268435467,268435471,536871438,536871648,536871717,536871835,536871882,536871905,536872014,536872019,536872098,536872383,536872733,536872840,536872956,536872983,536873674,536873767,536873822,536875054,536875162,536875243,536875258,536875276,536875405,536875622,536875679,536875942,536876281,536876412,536876439,536876620,536876857,536876913,536876931,536876977,536877263,536877724,536878439,536879220,536879765,536880117,536880261,536880806,536881074,536881479,536882091,536883142,536883262,536883929,536885996,536885997,536885998,536885999,536886000,536886001],"videos":[{"id":281,"video_id":"tppjzT-su0Q"}]},{"id":113421,"cover":{"id":80005,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co1pqd.jpg"},"name":"The Settlers 5: History Edition","platforms":[{"id":6,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}],"screenshots":[{"id":439296,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc9eyo.jpg"},{"id":439297,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc9eyp.jpg"},{"id":439298,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc9eyq.jpg"},{"id":439299,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc9eyr.jpg"},{"id":439300,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc9eys.jpg"},{"id":439301,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc9eyt.jpg"}],"summary":"With this modernized History Edition, dive into the diversified mix of enthralling build-up matches and exciting real-time fights.

Slowly over the years the law and order started to subside, people began to divide amongst themselves, big cities were gradually gone and replaced with smaller settlements, and the whole land started to slowly degrade. Many believe it’s because the Angelkind have abandoned it.\n\nNow the bandits roam the roads and wild animals roam the fields. The only safety can be found in smaller villages, where groups of people have banded to work together in order to survive. The relations between the different sentient races are very marginal and fragile. Some have been at long conflicts with one another, at times erupting into full blown wars. A holy Order of Atonement has been trying to keep the people together, but even their influence is limited to a handful of villages. And to top it all off, many believe a “Vindicator” will walk the land one day as a punisher of all the sins and bring forth a swift end upon it.","tags":[268435468,268435487,268435488]},{"id":34653,"cover":{"id":75854,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co1mj2.jpg"},"name":"Freedom Cry","platforms":[{"id":6,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}],"screenshots":[{"id":80573,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/uyxdexksdxl0nzdyuemj.jpg"},{"id":80574,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/ghm4bm1onal04gcx1xxm.jpg"},{"id":80575,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/lthtilai1bdm8eu55wee.jpg"},{"id":80576,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/ihdmwexsuzzpywhlfnhg.jpg"},{"id":80577,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/vlnviiifge3v3uqwenlz.jpg"}],"summary":"Freedom Cry is a 16-bit style RPG made by the same team behind Valiant, Vagrant Hearts and Ashes of Immortality.

And, instead of waiting for you to return to her native land of Sosaria, she wreaks havoc on your own Earth.\n\nThroughout Ultima II: Revenge of the Enchantress, your quest is quite different in scope from its predecessor. Earth is turned into a half-modern, half-fantasy world by the forces of magic and, as a result, things are much stranger than one might expect. As explained in the introduction, your tasks in the game are to \"Battle strange creatures across the face of the Earth, search for clues in careless words spoken at the local pub, traverse deep, dark, deadly dungeons and tall, terrifying towers...and conquer Time itself to battle Minax the Enchantress.\"","tags":[17,268435468,536871148,536871208,536871213,536871327,536871938,536872120,536872983,536875196,536875265,536875432,536875455,536875531,536876005,536876007,536876326,536876371,536879765]},{"id":173147,"cover":{"id":205840,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co4ets.jpg"},"name":"Tekken 7: Lei Wulong","platforms":[{"id":49,"name":"Xbox One"}],"screenshots":[{"id":719277,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scfezx.jpg"},{"id":719278,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scfezy.jpg"},{"id":719279,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scfezz.jpg"}],"summary":"The super cop Lei Wulong has joined the fray!
