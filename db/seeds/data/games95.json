Game modes include exhibition games (or \"regular season\" in-game), playoffs (best of one or best of seven) and an all new shoot-out mode. The main options remain basically the same couple since the establishment of the series - period length (5, 10 or 20 minutes), line changes (off, manual or the new automatic mode) and penalties.

The gameplay goes way beyond mere shooting and leads players to score highly by engaging with the game\u0027s mechanic to produce aesthetically pleasing abstract graphics “performances” as they play. \n \nSeveral game modes are included, along with simulations of the original Vic and C64 games so that players can see for themselves the game\u0027s history and how it has evolved in the 21st century.",

The route will be full of danger before they reach their destination in the depths of the Scorpion’s lands.\n\nYou will have to astutely lead and develop your squad in order to obtain victory. Recruit and develop the soldiers and creatures that will fight by your side, and establish sharp tactics to annihilate your enemies ! Careful management of your units, their powers and skills, as well as clever use of your environment will get you through near-death situations and lead you to epic victory !\n\nConfrontation also shines in multiplayer.

    "summary": "Much like its predecessor, Yo-kai Watch 2 is an open world role-playing video game, where the player is given control of player character Nathan Adams, or alternatively, Katie Forester. Players navigate around the open world using the Nintendo 3DS\u0027 touchscreen to find and befriend various Yo-kai, which are scattered across the overworld. Players befriend Yo-kai by giving them a food that they like before beginning battle, and after defeating the Yo-kai it approaches the player character and gives them its Yo-kai Medal, allowing it to be summoned at will. A new feature in battles is using the touch screen to find a particular sweetspot on an enemy Yo-kai to increase the likelihood of befriending it at the end of the battle, or other sweetspots for extra damage, extra money, or extra experience. Yo-kai can also be acquired through an in game Crank-a-kai (Gasha Machine) by collecting in-game coins or using Play Coins. Certain Yo-kai are necessary for completing the game\u0027s main quest, and special rare Yo-kai are acquired through various subquests. Yo-kai have the capability to evolve into more powerful versions of themselves if they reach a certain level, or they can evolve by combining with particular items or other Yo-kai. The Yo-kai are divided amongst eight different classes, each with their own strengths and weaknesses. There are also Legendary Yo-kai that can only be obtained by collecting a particular set of Yo-kai listed in the Yo-kai Medallium, a compendium of the different Yo-kai the player has encountered or befriended. When the player encounters a Yo-kai, he enters into battle with it using six Yo-kai that the player has befriended previously. The touchscreen is used during battles to rotate amongst the player\u0027s Yo-kai in battle at will. It is also used either to clear up status effects on the player\u0027s Yo-kai or to charge up the Yo-kai\u0027s Soultimate abilities. While the original Yo-kai Watch featured nearly 250 Yo-kai, Yo-Kai Watch 2 features nearly 450, including several that were featured as bosses in the original game.",

While he really likes eroge, he can\u0027t draw, isn\u0027t much of a writer or composer, and doesn\u0027t know much about business. Still, his dream is to get a job at an eroge studio in hopes of creating what he loves, eroge. \n \nTomoya\u0027s luck takes a turn for the better when he sees a help wanted ad for the local studio Flower, and after a meeting with the company president (who to his surprise looks like an elementary school kid), manages to get a job as administrator of the company\u0027s website. Tomoya\u0027s glee at being part of the eroge industry is short-lived, as he soon learns that Flower is on the chopping block due to their first title being a massive failure. \n \nAfter playing through Flower\u0027s first title, Tomoya realizes that his co-workers don\u0027t know anything about eroge, lacking the insight and understanding needed to make a good game. After some nudging from the president of Flower\u0027s parent company and some soul searching of his own, our protagonist takes it upon himself to save Flower by teaching the four girls on staff the ins and outs of what makes an eroge good. The story thus focuses on Tomoya\u0027s role as a psuedo-consultant while getting to know the four heroines of the story as the player is given an interesting look at the world of eroge development.",

The team that carries the ball into the opponent\u0027s end zone scores a touchdown, the team with the most touchdowns at the end of the game is the winner. However, it’s how you decide to do this that makes things interesting, the ends justify the means! It’s not just the players you have at your disposal either. You can bribe the referee to look the other way as you cripple or trample annoying opponents and hire illegal wizards to give you a hand directly from the crowd… Blood Bowl severely tests the finest tacticians\u0027 strategies.\t \n \nThere are many races to accommodate every player’s profile (23 in the Chaos Edition, 20 in the Legendary Edition, 9 in the Standard Edition) and even more strategies for experimenting. Winning a game requires a strong game-sense and a lot of self-control. \n \nFor the player\u0027s enjoyment, omnipresent humour and the use of spells, weapons, and other non-regulatory actions place Blood Bowl outside of the classic sport simulation genre.",

It was released on Xbox 360 in July 2010 and is a direct sequel to the 2007 video game Crackdown.\n\nThe game is modeled similarly to its predecessor Crackdown, a third-person shooter in open world game play. The player character is an advanced super-powered officer for the city-funded \"Agency\", known simply as the \"Agent\". This time around, players choose one of four faces and armor colours (eight colours if you preordered it), instead of just the preset heads offered before. Along with that, the orbs have been carried on from the first game, and the Agent\u0027s powers are expanded and enhanced such as the Agility Skill which now allows the Agent to jump higher than in Crackdown, glide, and gain access to the helicopter landing pad at the Agency Tower. Driving is also available in Crackdown 2. You’re able to commandeer any number of vehicles in the game, including Agency vehicles, Peacekeeper Cruisers and a large number of civilian vehicles that the Cell have armor plated. Checkpoint races are back, both Road and Rooftop versions. Like Crackdown, the game will allow for on-line co-operative play in the main game, but will now support up to four players. The game will also feature competitive multiplayer modes for up to sixteen players. While the original Crackdown supported System Link playing for co-op, Crackdown 2 won\u0027t be featuring the same option.",

    "summary": "Dragoneila is a addicting MMORPG with new gameplay techniques and mechanics. We decided to abandon the standard MMORPG systems and want to show a new vision of game mechanics and interaction with the world. We want show that players completely influence the outcome of the world, where every action, has a consequence, for example, if this is a quest or killing a monster, then the world can change and transform. Only the players decide what the world will be like. You yourself decide to kill someone or make an alliance. In the world of Dragoneila, all animals and monsters have their own thoughts, their views on the world, you can get along with them or start a war, they will become your allies or you want to completely destroy their existence - you decide. We\u0027ve also removed the usual quest system, making it more interesting. You don\u0027t need to complete normal quests or kill monsters to achieve anything in Dragoneila. Even a trip to the open world can bring you a lot of useful and exciting experiences.\n\nThe world of this game is unpredictable and changeable, endowed with magic and amazing creatures - it can completely change depending on the actions of the players. The game itself supports an open world mode. You can travel anywhere. Aerial islands and heavenly kingdoms, underwater kingdoms, caves with hot lava, deserts and territories covered with eternal snow will open for you. There are amazing things hidden all over the world - from magic to unique items. But be careful, it also has many dangers - from traps to being transported to other worlds. Day and night, the world is completely different - at night it becomes more dangerous, completely different from the usual world during the day.\n\nAs you already understood, Dragoneila is not quite your usual MMORPG, it has undergone many changes and improvements in game mechanics, in the interaction between NPC / AI and players, as well as in the interaction with world.",

    "summary": "Somewhere between sanity and madness lies a realm torn between the two. Illusions become reality, and reality becomes nothing more than a vision. \n \nHUMAN is a short psychological horror game which examines inherent, earthly, and otherworldly evils, and the forces which drive them. As you make your way through an Alaskan auroral research facility in search of employees it quickly becomes very clear that something has become alerted to your presence. Suspiciously, once it knows you\u0027re there, you\u0027re more than welcome to be there. Drawing you in, you soon begin to question all you see and hear. \n \nHUMAN is highly metaphorical, yet accessible. All is explained in it\u0027s simplest essence, but for those willing to look beyond the surface, there lies layer upon layer of symbolism, and clues regarding the nature of reality, which add depth to the meaning behind HUMAN. \n \nHUMAN is primarily story and experience driven, however environmental puzzles and problem solving are interlaced within. You will also use observation to find what\u0027s necessary in order to progress. Tablets throughout the facility contain research notes which you can zoom in on and read which help give further context to the story.",

The episodes are:\nPrince of Destiny\nThe Undead Kingdom\nDungeons of Doom\n\nThe game was released as freeware on March 20, 2009.\n\nGameplay:\n\nDark Ages is a side scrolling game where the player\u0027s alter ego, the prince, can move sideways, jump and shoot. Game play involves killing and avoiding enemies and jumping over obstacles. Progression to the next level often involves a hidden door, revealed by one of several Wise Men type characters after retrieving an item for them. The items include a key, a shield, and an apple.\n\nThe player can use magic to fight the prince\u0027s enemies, starting out with a simple energy bolt and slowly gaining access to more destructive spells as the game progresses. There are three spells in the game: a blue bolt that flies straight forward, a boomerang that flies forward then returns allowing enemies to be hit twice, and a magic beam with a shorter range but can kill most enemies in one hit and can be fired in rapid succession.",

Many parts of the map can be clicked to receive information about famous sightseeing locations and historical buildings. \n \nLondon has the Chow Time mini-game where hungry pups need to be fed as an arcade game. A character needs to be moved near the top of the screen, sliding food down one of the four long vertical tables when a puppy appears. The food needs to reach the puppy before they reach the kitchen or a live is lost. The game keeps track of high scores. In the art gallery, a custom picture can be created using backgrounds, stickers, colours, characters and illustrations. You can also adopt a puppy and play with it through actions such as feeding or taking it to the park to meet other dogs and play fetch. There are four international parks to visit including Tokyo. \n \nIn Paris, there is a detective mini-game involving locating missing puppies. It can be played with one or two players. This is done by gathering clues from the Parisian Twilight Bark gang of dogs. The answers they provide a stored in a notebook and the player needs to compare these with the description provided about the missing dogs to identify the correct one. Elements include the breed and origin, colour, size, and types of hair and ears. In Le Pelt\u0027s bakery, a platform game can be played controlling Oddball. He needs to collect all puppies before Cruella, Alonzo, or Le Pelt capture her. The villains can be slowed down by throwing frosting, butter and jelly at them, collected as power-ups.",

The game utilizes the M.U.G.E.N engine, but unlike other MUGEN games all of the sprites are made entirely by scratch. This not only gives the game a uniform and \"professional\" artstyle, but it also allows for better control of balance.\n\nDevelopment for the game started in 2005, but was halted for several years before being quietly discontinued. In June of 2018, Ahuron released a prototype of the game from 2011 that featured the four marquee characters. At least two updates featuring more characters and stages are planned for release soon after, but beyond that, the game will receive no further updates or bug fixes.",

    "summary": "Lumines is a block-dropping game, that may seem at first to be similar to Columns and Tetris. A 2 x 2 square (an O tetromino) made of four smaller block pieces is dropped into the playing field, which may appear different as the player advances through levels or skins. The small blocks that comprise the larger blocks will be one of two different colors. The objective is to rotate and align the blocks in such a way as to create 2x2 squares of the same color, which may span multiple blocks and, indeed, share blocks. For example, if one should get a 2x3 area of matching blocks, the middle portion will \"share\" itself with both the left and right halves and create two 2x2 squares. After the \"timeline\", which is synchronized to the music, sweeps over the matching blocks, they disappear. When too many unmatched blocks pile up to the point where no more blocks may be dropped in the playing field, the game ends. \nWhen part of a falling block hits an obstruction, the unobstructed portion of the block will split off and continue to fall. More points are scored by creating the largest number of squares during one \"timeline\" sweep. Increasing score multipliers are earned by repeatedly clearing squares on consecutive timeline sweeps. Bonuses are also awarded by reducing all remaining tiles to one single color or for removing all non-active tiles from the screen altogether. \nOccasionally, a block falls with a special square of one of the two colors with a \"jewel\" in the center. This square, when cleared as part of a matched 2x2 square, will cause all individual blocks of the same color that are horizontally or vertically adjacent to the matched 2x2 square, or to an adjacent square, to be cleared without score. These can be used for both generating large bonuses, since generally several blocks of the other color will be formed once these are removed, as well as to help the player recover if the field becomes too cluttered.",

Along the way, they\u0027ll meet a new cast of characters (with a few returning familiar faces!), alongside a brand new art style, new character models, and more.\n\nWith user-friendly tutorials, players will immediately be able to jump into the thick of things, customizing their farm by raising and lowering the land, creating rivers, ponds, and more. Upgraded tools will assist farmers in shaping the land more efficiently, and afterwards they can kick back and relax in their boat to do a spot of fishing! It won\u0027t be long before they\u0027ll need to weigh anchor to care for their newest herd animal: the Poitou donkey!\"",
