Featuring three complete games, Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty, Metal Gear Solid: Snake Eater and Metal Gear Solid: Peace Walker, the HD Collection offers old and new fans a chance to experience the epic game play, design and storytelling of the MGS franchise. The \"Metal Gear Solid (MGS)\" series is the seminal work of Hideo Kojima, Japan's master game creator, and the progenitor of the stealth action game genre. The series has become a global phenomenon, with over 27 million copies sold worldwide. The player controls a secret agent from an elite special forces unit who is sent on solo sneaking missions through enemy installations, vast jungles, and sometimes even the thick of battle. Alone and surrounded by the enemy, even a special forces agent will find it tough to come out alive. But that is the secret behind the series' popularity-the cerebral challenge of figuring out how to avoid combat, and the thrill of sneaking through enemy territory undetected.The MGS series is also known for its storyline, which blends seamlessly with the gameplay. The scenarios are based on extensive research and incorporate the drama of actual developments in society. These elements have made MGS what it is today: a mature work of entertainment that transcends national borders and the confines of video games, and one of the leading products of the Japanese content business.","tags":[1,23,268435480,268435487]},{"id":926,"cover":{"id":106739,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co2acz.jpg"},"name":"Unreal Tournament 2003","platforms":[{"id":3,"name":"Linux"},{"id":6,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"},{"id":14,"name":"Mac"}],"screenshots":[{"id":700,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/yxiej0dvgehknfdbcwdq.jpg"},{"id":701,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/zfid2naiulhwi9omzzbp.jpg"},{"id":702,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/boust0otkdmsxjvodrtv.jpg"},{"id":703,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sxlbghvbrwdcsgzkk2lv.jpg"},{"id":704,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/e0d6ccilemhifyjjrmy6.jpg"}],"summary":"In 2291, consensual murder is legalized, opening the way for a previously underground event. Smaller mining companies have been running smaller matches to channel aggression, but now the Liandri Mining Corporation established a professional league, which quickly proves to be an extremely lucrative way of public entertainment. Liandri entered into the Tournament, as it is officially called, sponsoring their own team, the Corrupt. The Corrupt's leader, Xan Kriegor, quickly achieved champion status and held it for two years. In 2293, a human named Malcolm dethroned him and became champion himself. A huge media figure, Malcolm is hailed as the biggest star in human history and is worshipped as a god. His success nets great rewards for his sponsoring corporation, attracting the attention of jealous rivals both in the arenas of the Tournament and in the corridors of power a galaxy away. Liandri attempted to win back the champion title with Xan MK2 but failed (unknown to the other contestants, each member of the Corrupt is purely robotic, including Xan). \nNow it is 2302. The Tournament is undergoing a massive overhaul. The aging Sniper Rifle (a relic of centuries past) is removed from the Tournament as is \"Assault\" - a team-based event that forms a part of the competition. Many fans of the Tournament complain at these changes, with some combatants refusing to participate in the new format. Malcolm, shortly after his victory, hired two of his former opponents (Brock and Lauren, members of the former Iron Guard team) as teammates in his reformed Thunder Crash team. But the Axon Research Corporation, another of the four great corporations, entered the Tournament as well, sponsoring the geneboosted Juggernaut team, led by the brutal and savage Gorge.","tags":[1,18,268435461,536871041,536871213,536871365,536871470,536872070,536872078,536872245,536872352,536872375,536873715,536874743,536874813,536874900,536874947,536875056,536875073,536875097,536875122,536875242,536875265,536875298,536875358,536875484,536875492,536875527,536875562,536875573,536875609,536875642,536875682,536875802,536875804,536875814,536875819,536875822,536875830,536875901,536875902,536875941,536876221,536876232,536876262,536876355,536876357,536876391,536876412,536876415,536876472,536876521,536876633,536876660,536876748,536876818,536876821,536876855,536876856,536876857,536876871,536876899,536876947,536877144,536877208,536877210,536877211,536877212,536877213,536877215,536877220,536877227,536877283,536877407,536877443,536877531,536877618,536877628,536877820,536877935,536877938,536877950,536877952,536877974,536878002,536878004,536878005,536878036,536878104,536878317,536878579,536879214,536879218,536879704,536879705,536879707,536879711,536879869,536879870,536879987,536879992,536880208,536880225,536880442,536880625,536880737,536880765,536880768,536880872,536880959,536880960,536881514,536881515,536881542,536881629,536882508,536882698,536883191,536883206,536884029,536886095,536886273,536886275,536886276,536886277,536886573,536886611,536886612,536886613],"videos":[{"id":3522,"video_id":"b18Va6bl1Q4"},{"id":3523,"video_id":"3vGqfNXV3HM"},{"id":3524,"video_id":"pZbOt05sGKc"}]},{"id":122202,"cover":{"id":80554,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co1q5m.jpg"},"name":"Toki-Tori Collection","platforms":[{"id":130,"name":"Nintendo Switch"}],"summary":"This collection includes Toki Tori 1 and Toki Tori 2+."},{"id":138050,"cover":{"id":113590,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co2fna.jpg"},"name":"Dungeons 2: A Clash of Pumpkins","platforms":[{"id":6,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}],"screenshots":[{"id":524545,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scb8qp.jpg"},{"id":524546,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scb8qq.jpg"},{"id":524550,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scb8qu.jpg"},{"id":524557,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scb8r1.jpg"},{"id":524561,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scb8r5.jpg"},{"id":524566,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scb8ra.jpg"}],"summary":"This free DLC for the game Dungeons II adds three Halloween related maps to the game.","tags":[17,268435468,268435469,268435471]},{"id":48261,"cover":{"id":27387,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/dmcpzi498digrqnnxonu.jpg"},"name":"Wall Street Kid","platforms":[{"id":18,"name":"Nintendo Entertainment System (NES)"}],"summary":"Where life, love and money all depend on how well you play the game.

There he received instruction from his wise teacher, Juan. Though he was young, he made himself a master of Kempo. One day, his teacher Juan was attacked and robbed of the Secret Scrolls of Hiryu-no-Ken, of which he was the author. Ryuhi possessed the 6th volume of the Secret Scrolls, the Shingan-no Sho, or book of the mind's eye which Juan had managed to save. Ryuhi begins his journey to Shorinji in compliance with Juan's last request. Gengai, the bishop of Shorinji welcomed the little Ryuhi, regarded as one of the titans of Shourinji Kempo. Six years later, they received a letter of challenge from the Tusk Soldiers, a mysterious organization of enemies of the Shorinji. Ryuhi is determined to take part in the upcoming \"World Tournament of Contact Sports\" as a representative of Shorinji. His desire is to prevent the Tusk Soldiers from becoming champions of Contact Sports at the tournament. Ryuhi heard from Gengai that in truth it was the Tusk Soldiers who attacked his teacher and robbed him of the Secret Scrolls. As he leaves for the World Tournament, his thoughts are on his teacher Juan and keeping the fighting spirit burning. The game features combat in a variety of formats, such as kicking and using fireballs to repel monsters in scrolling stages, a system during one-on-one duels against Tusk Soldiers or a pair of martial arts tournaments where the player must attack a mark that appears on their opponent's body, or defend the area when it appears on them (this system is similar to Culture Brain's original Flying Dragon for the NES), and RPG-style command battles against monster bosses. When confronted by a Tusk Soldier or other otherworldly villain, Rick can change into a costumed superhero form or switch with one of his teammates. The player must switch to Flying Warrior form to use the characters' magic powers and defend themselves from the Tusk Soldiers' magic spells.","tags":[1,268435460,268435468,268435487,536870926,536870973,536871139,536871208,536871938,536872897,536873299,536875406,536875434,536875485,536875944,536876348,536877696,536886460]},{"id":173205,"cover":{"id":183052,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co3x8s.jpg"},"name":"Ningakki XXVI FPS","platforms":[{"id":3,"name":"Linux"},{"id":6,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"},{"id":14,"name":"Mac"}],"screenshots":[{"id":646902,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scdv5i.jpg"},{"id":646908,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scdv5o.jpg"},{"id":646915,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scdv5v.jpg"},{"id":646919,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scdv5z.jpg"},{"id":646926,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scdv66.jpg"},{"id":646930,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scdv6a.jpg"}],"summary":"A first person shooter set in a dark future filled with death robots.

There are several characters to choose from, each with a unique truck and attributes.\n\nThe game starts out in Key West and players travel across the United States, ending in San Francisco. After Stage 1, the game gives the player a choice of trailer. One trailer is harder to haul, but provides a bigger payoff while the other choice is easier to haul but provides a smaller payoff. Money is deducted from the total when the trailer is hit. Players can sound the truck's horn to make other cars on the road yield and slipstream behind large vehicles to gain a momentary speed boost.\n\nIn addition to the time limit, players also compete with the \"Lizard Tail\", a rival trucker. Crossing the finish line before the Lizard Tail yields additional money. In between levels, players can park the truck in a mini game to earn more cash.","tags":[1,268435466,536871317,536871556],"videos":[{"id":3028,"video_id":"bGi8XGy9v1k"},{"id":61018,"video_id":"A2IYw8AP5Sw"}]},{"id":185180,"cover":{"id":199831,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co4a6v.jpg"},"name":"Agarta","platforms":[{"id":6,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}],"screenshots":[{"id":700986,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scf0vu.jpg"},{"id":700987,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scf0vv.jpg"},{"id":700988,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scf0vw.jpg"}],"summary":"Agarta is an interactive live-action game (FMV), it follows the story of a serial killer nicknamed the Surgeon.

Corruption prospers planet-side and only space can give a man his freedom, but not without a cost: space is not a safe place anymore. Human space pirates, rogue AI computers that rebelled against humanity and empire patrol ships roam space in search of easy prey.\n\nPlayers begin the game as a bounty hunter with little more than an old, run-down space fighter and a dream, but as they advance in the game and prosper, their piloting and battle skills improve, allowing access to more advance spacecraft. Players can control a party of up to six bounty hunters, each possessing different skills, abilities and personality.\n\nTeam tactics give players vast opportunities in battles when shear fire power isn't enough. Tactical ruses, planning and executing ambushes or deploying spaceships' special abilities provide cunning commanders the ability to crush enemies according to their style of play.","tags":[18,268435468,268435469,268435471,536870936,536871882,536871886,536871938,536874694,536875196,536875257,536875559,536877679,536878413],"videos":[{"id":5352,"video_id":"ZZcT8pl1iJU"}]},{"id":1470,"cover":{"id":166332,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co3kcc.jpg"},"name":"Kururin Paradise","platforms":[{"id":24,"name":"Game Boy Advance"},{"id":41,"name":"Wii U"}],"screenshots":[{"id":1634,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/atfs5qlob3gthfynxzuv.jpg"},{"id":1635,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/femzd6jtwgf0zx2soanz.jpg"},{"id":1636,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/hnpfjkvitdnf27rd4wqn.jpg"},{"id":1637,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/hpl2rz6smnqx5cico06m.jpg"},{"id":1638,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/muepgql26bixqicjj8qn.jpg"},{"id":671531,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scee5n.jpg"},{"id":671532,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scee5o.jpg"},{"id":671533,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scee5p.jpg"},{"id":671534,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scee5q.jpg"}],"summary":"Kururin Paradise revolves around avoiding collisions as the player maneuver a robot through levels.

Players that enjoy replay value can expect around 70 possible decisions to explore, some of which will even influence Kazuki's \"romantic\" relationship with his female colleagues at Igrasil. \n \nAs for adult content in Bloody Chronicles, four unlockable episodes called \"IF mode\" are releasing soon and will feature Igrasil members Aki, Suzumi, Kaoru, and Akito.

Haru applied for the job on the spot, leaving her hometown to work in their mansion in Tokyo.
