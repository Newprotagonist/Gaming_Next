We understand that you hate most early access games however this is different. We are taking time and ensuring that most bugs and glitches are fixed before release to steam. We are going to be doing Closed Betas for the time being so that people who are our fans can test it and try with friends. \n \nWe don't believe in P2W (Pay to win) games and we definitely won't bring out DLC like other games have even thought they haven't finished their game yet. Which we know is wrong. Another thing we are not is money grabbers, when we do start gathering funds we will be hosting events with it, improving the game for you. And most importantly providing a better experience for our users. \nFacebook","tags":[1,19,21,23,38,268435461,268435471,268435487,268435488,536870981,536871365,536872032,536874401,536874402,536874403,536874404,536874405,536874406,536874694]},{"id":127559,"cover":{"id":87059,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co1v6b.jpg"},"name":"Duck Hunt","platforms":[{"id":6,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}],"screenshots":[{"id":347567,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc7g6n.jpg"},{"id":347568,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc7g6o.jpg"},{"id":347569,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc7g6p.jpg"}],"summary":"Using your 12 GA.

The mice and cats all move in predictable paths by always turning right when hitting a wall head on, by following corners or by turning around when in a dead end. \n \nChuChu Rocket!'s multiplayer mode revolves around up to four players placing arrows on the level at once, trying to direct mice into their own rockets and cats into other players' rockets (any cat that reaches a rocket removes a percentage of the mice within). Each player can only have three arrows on-screen at a time and cannot place them on other players' arrows or their own arrows. Arrows would disappear over time, or could be removed by a player placing his fourth arrow (which would eliminate the first arrow placed, thus leaving three). Although a simple concept, this quickly becomes frenetic with the relentless speed of the mice and four players fighting over them.","tags":[1,18,268435465,268435471,536871208,536871882,536872245,536872257,536873787,536874694,536874966,536875241,536875280,536875434,536875435,536876415,536878084,536884029,536884030]},{"id":110346,"name":"Spirits of Mystery: Chains of Promise - Collector's Edition","platforms":[{"id":6,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}],"screenshots":[{"id":252257,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/vrx04vp1t1asqx2iodf4.jpg"},{"id":252259,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/xabs9skwa0itqdm7i7lc.jpg"},{"id":252260,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/hma2h0axgy5wrdcwjvku.jpg"},{"id":252261,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/ddum3f6h5kvsebdmrl8x.jpg"},{"id":252262,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/p62sz5bflorztjgiwnsr.jpg"},{"id":252263,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/vdjewuwdpfk4gnx7lqxp.jpg"},{"id":252265,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/kjqd65i5cgsesjqlmo29.jpg"},{"id":252268,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/yc9lxka5x7e8hpws3znz.jpg"},{"id":252269,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/nkclxozh8g1hehdki1fc.jpg"},{"id":252272,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/ximhndmcnkoln8ucrgzy.jpg"}],"summary":"Isa's back to his old tricks, and now he's doing the bidding of an even greater foe.","tags":[268435487]},{"id":153264,"name":"Trainz Railroad Simulator 2019: The Innter Kohn Necktion Railroad","platforms":[{"id":6,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"},{"id":14,"name":"Mac"}],"screenshots":[{"id":496542,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scan4u.jpg"},{"id":496553,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scan55.jpg"},{"id":496562,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scan5e.jpg"},{"id":496569,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scan5l.jpg"},{"id":496582,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scan5y.jpg"},{"id":496588,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scan64.jpg"},{"id":496591,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scan67.jpg"},{"id":496597,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scan6d.jpg"},{"id":496599,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scan6f.jpg"},{"id":496601,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scan6h.jpg"},{"id":496609,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scan6p.jpg"},{"id":496617,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scan6x.jpg"},{"id":496628,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scan78.jpg"},{"id":496631,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scan7b.jpg"}],"summary":"The Innter Kohn Necktion Railroad has both a standard gauge and narrow gauge for this superb TRS19 model railroad layout.","tags":[268435469]},{"id":72407,"name":"President Evil","platforms":[{"id":6,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}],"screenshots":[{"id":127923,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/ilapyvetjuimythlhu4k.jpg"},{"id":127924,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/zvyitba8wc1lm61qmtct.jpg"},{"id":127925,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/soexl3i714wrnqurbkjj.jpg"},{"id":127926,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/h15dpsw0xvq2z2et47ya.jpg"},{"id":127927,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/pru2c53kyvrciobsgx40.jpg"}],"summary":"My name is Tony Dramp.

Though it is listed as one of Doomworld's Top 100 WADs of All Time in the year 1999, its release on the idgames archive dates it at 17 March of 2000. It is known primarily for being composed of short, fairly straightforward levels, a possible progenitor of Erik Alm's Scythe.\n\nDemonfear is a compilation of small episodes released by Windsor between 1995 and 1999, known otherwise as Demonfear 1-6. An early, alternate version of Demonfear 6 was partially complete in 1997, but Windsor donated the maps to Requiem when the project had stagnated due to a handful of authors failing to provide maps for slots they had claimed. The compiler dropped Windsor's levels into the previously vacant slots so that his old Demonfear 6 MAP26, 27, and 28 appear as Requiem's MAP20, 26, and 25, respectively. Windsor would go on to create a new Demonfear 6 and then compile his own megawad.\n\nDemonfear comes with a text file that describes in detail the story of the megawad on a level-by-level basis. The plot involves another surprise demon invasion of Earth; mirroring the action of Doom II, the protagonist travels through various military complexes and into a city, eventually entering Hell itself in what is apparently a twisted facsimile of the normal world.\n\nIn 2019, Doomworld user P41R47 made a MIDI pack for Demonfear, which also includes miscellaneous enhancements for the intermission, text screens, and ending.","tags":[1,268435461,536896999,536897000]},{"id":171264,"cover":{"id":200131,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co4af7.jpg"},"name":"Deathsmiles I & II: Gothic wa Mahou Otome Love Max Edition","platforms":[{"id":48,"name":"PlayStation 4"},{"id":49,"name":"Xbox One"},{"id":130,"name":"Nintendo Switch"}],"screenshots":[{"id":702951,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scf2ef.jpg"},{"id":702952,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scf2eg.jpg"},{"id":702953,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scf2eh.jpg"}],"summary":"The Gothic wa Mahou Otome Love Max Edition includes:\n・ Game software for PS4 \"Death Smiles I / II\" (special edition: OST CD + Special DLC )\n・ B2 tapestry drawn by Dr. Junya Inoue\n・ \"Death Smiles\" original acrylic panel\n・ \"Jill Ballard\" A4 microfiber towel","tags":[1,268435461,536871078,536888463],"videos":[{"id":62207,"video_id":"7P9vW3HkFx4"}]},{"id":49666,"cover":{"id":185839,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co3ze7.jpg"},"name":"Zoids Saga: Fuzors","platforms":[{"id":24,"name":"Game Boy Advance"}],"summary":"Zoids Saga: Fuzors is a Role-Playing game, developed by Amedio and published by Tomy Corporation, which was released in Japan in 2004.","tags":[268435468]},{"id":140683,"cover":{"id":121707,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co2lwr.jpg"},"name":"Peachleaf Pirates","platforms":[{"id":6,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}],"screenshots":[{"id":487033,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scafsp.jpg"},{"id":487034,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scafsq.jpg"},{"id":487035,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scafsr.jpg"},{"id":487036,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scafss.jpg"},{"id":487037,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scafst.jpg"},{"id":487038,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scafsu.jpg"},{"id":487039,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scafsv.jpg"},{"id":487040,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scafsw.jpg"}],"summary":"Washed ashore with no memory of how you got there, an eccentric cast of locals welcome you to their quirky paradise.

Released in March 1999 for the PC by On-Line PLC. Similarly to the earlier CRL game, the player plays as Brad or Janet and must rescue their partner from the castle. Unlike the older computer game, its gameplay was more puzzle-oriented, and benefited from the added detail, graphics, and live video sequences that the PC could provide. Despite this, it was criticised for a clumsy user interface and for using two-dimensional graphics, at a time when most games were using 2.5D. The game featured Richard O'Brien who pops up from time to time taunting the player, but he does not play \"Riff-Raff\" in the game. He also is a performer for songs from the play/film on the in-game jukebox. Well respected horror film legend Christopher Lee fills the shoes of Charles Gray as The Criminologist.","tags":[17,18,19,268435458,268435465,268435487,536870915,536871255,536872098,536872179,536872408,536874498,536875125,536875243,536875294,536875700,536875831,536877398]},{"id":12510,"aggregated_rating":80.0,"cover":{"id":115383,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co2h13.jpg"},"name":"Renowned Explorers: International Society","platforms":[{"id":3,"name":"Linux"},{"id":6,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"},{"id":14,"name":"Mac"}],"screenshots":[{"id":95517,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/uicojiw5xbdxirnrwikq.jpg"},{"id":95518,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/mldxru2wt0qrdzenbqxa.jpg"},{"id":95519,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/vbgkuy9uty1q2jxjep0m.jpg"},{"id":95520,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/aunvtzmykzvpjz4qwtnc.jpg"},{"id":95521,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/mzyjoe6kycfhf6zyhac9.jpg"}],"summary":"Take command of a hand-picked group of unalike explorers and travel across the globe in search of legendary treasures while staying ahead of your rivals.

Along the way, the Horseman discovers that there are far worse things than an earthly Apocalypse, and that an ancient grudge may threaten all of Creation.\n\nDarksiders II follows the exploits of Death, one of the four horsemen of the Apocalypse, in an action-packed tale that runs parallel to the events in the original Darksiders game. This epic journey propels Death across an expansive gameworld as he tries to redeem his brother, War, the horseman blamed for prematurely starting the Apocalypse in Darksiders.\n\nLike the original Darksiders game before it, the second iteration of the series is primarily a hack 'n slash adventure. The game takes place across netherworld environments, including 'The White city', an outpost where angels live, and 'The Eternal Throne', a floating fortress where the Lords of the Dead stand guard over souls that need to be cleansed. Although Death is the most feared of the Four Horsemen, his physical abilities are very different than his brother, War. Death is far more nimble, and relies on a combination of melee and ranged attacks. In combat Death's primary weapon is his huge iconic scythe, with a wide range of other weapons and usable items that must be gathered as the game progresses. Weapons can be dual-wielded, upgradable armor can be acquired for protection and Death has access to his terrifying and powerful mount, Despair.","tags":[1,17,38,268435465,268435468,268435481,268435487,536871389,536871449,536872220,536872942,536873338],"videos":[{"id":19228,"video_id":"65s8MNPb--s"}]},{"id":153301,"name":"Trainz Route: Mojave Sub Division","platforms":[{"id":6,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"},{"id":14,"name":"Mac"}],"screenshots":[{"id":496926,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scanfi.jpg"},{"id":496936,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scanfs.jpg"},{"id":496943,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scanfz.jpg"},{"id":496948,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scang4.jpg"},{"id":496956,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scangc.jpg"},{"id":496963,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scangj.jpg"},{"id":496971,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scangr.jpg"},{"id":496977,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scangx.jpg"},{"id":496981,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scanh1.jpg"},{"id":496984,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scanh4.jpg"},{"id":496987,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scanh7.jpg"},{"id":496990,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scanha.jpg"},{"id":496993,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scanhd.jpg"},{"id":496996,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scanhg.jpg"},{"id":496997,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scanhh.jpg"},{"id":496999,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scanhj.jpg"},{"id":497001,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scanhl.jpg"},{"id":497008,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scanhs.jpg"},{"id":497018,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scani2.jpg"},{"id":497024,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scani8.jpg"}],"summary":"The Mojave Sub Division.

When a wealthy baron passes away, his will reveals an elusive treasure hidden someplace inside the village. Now it's up to Professor Layton to untangle St. Mystere's riddles and puzzles, find the hidden treasure, and crack the case.\n\nWhen the wealthy Baron Augustus Reinhold passes away, his will reveals a hidden treasure in the village of St. Mystere. Unable to locate the treasure themselves, the baron's family calls upon renowned puzzle expert Professor Layton and his apprentice, Luke, for help. Upon the pair's arrival, their search for the treasure is interrupted by the suspicious death of another member of the Reinhold family. Now with two mysteries on their hands, Professor Layton and Luke must work their way through the village's many puzzles, riddles and brainteasers to find the truth.\n\n• As Professor Layton, players tackle more than 130 puzzles as they unravel the mysteries of the village.
