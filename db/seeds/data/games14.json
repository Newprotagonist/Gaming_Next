Since that time the fallen empire has lain lifeless -- a rich corpse waiting to be picked clean. Now, a sinister ex-KGB general codenamed Shadowman directs a flock of vultures to swoop in from all parts of Eastern Europe and claim Russia\u0027s nuclear warheads and weapons of mass terror. While directing these \u0027wars of liberation\u0027 Shadowman intends to shake democratic Russia to it\u0027s foundations, bringing about a return to the Cold War...or even worse. You chopper into Crimea and discover the plot of this Russian madman using thermal spy devices. You must quickly move on to the Black Sea to prevent the hijacking of ICBM ships, respond to an attack on a chemical weapons plant in the desert passes, and then recover a nuclear reactor core in Transylvania. As you successfully thwart these stages of Operation Vulture, Shadowman is forced to take his coup to the streets of Moscow. Guide your chopper through five unique 3D worlds as you complete 41 deadly missions. Enemy vehicles, tactics, and responses change, based upon your activities, making this the first of STRIKE\u0027s new \"Living Battlefields\".",

It is not a port of an existing roguelike as the controls of the GBA are very different from the traditional keyboard and the screen imposes some additional limitations. It is built around replayability and long term ergonomics, not short term learning. It uses actual graphic tiles (16x16) rather than the traditional characters. You may wish it didn\u0027t as I drew the tiles and am not an artist. \n \nI created POWDER for one simple reason: I wanted a roguelike on my GBA. The standard RPGs were annoying me with endless battle screens against weak enemies to unfold a drug induced plotline. I wanted a game I could just jump into and start killing things. Having had more hours than I\u0027d care to log playing Nethack, ADOM, and the Diablos, I knew the exact type of game I wanted. The problem was I didn\u0027t see anyone publishing it any time soon. \n \nThis release of POWDER is for anyone in a similar situation who doesn\u0027t want to spend the time needed to write a roguelike.",

Yukito is a well-known honor student at the local school, unable to leave those alone that need his help. As a second year student the new spring will bring him new feelings in his teenage life. Feelings that will soon turn into beautiful realisation.\n\nIn this game there are five heroines, first there’s the transfer student from Canada, Bethly. She loves to paint but only knew the very basics of Japanese before she came to Japan. Next up there’s Hinata, a junior at school who also can’t leave someone alone when they need help. Momiji is Yukito’s classmate and sits next to him in class. She wants to make it onto the big stage of theater plays.\n\nAlso aiming for the top is figure skater Mizuha, Yukito’s childhood friend. He gets to meet her again after 2 years abroad. Last of the heroines is his step sister Yuzuki, who somehow feels far away. But maybe that’s because it’s only been one year since she and her mother moved in with them.\n\nFrom here the story will only have one goal. After so many years, Yukito’s life will take a big turn in just 3 seasons. This is a story of love–",

You can wander freely around the game environment, collecting evidence and witnessing constantly changing events.\n\nHowever, the centrepiece of the game is interviewing the characters you meet, who can be questioned about all the evidence you’ve collected and things you’ve seen.

Match cannonballs to fire on your enemy. Match coins to gain gold. Match scrolls to gain experience. Match red, blue or green gems to use talismans, when you get them. Later, match wheels to move your ship away to, hopefully, throw off your enemy\u0027s aim. You can match three times of your choice. After that, the enemy makes three matches. If you or your enemy match four or five of the same item, you or they will get one or two extra matches, respectively. \n \nAfter the battle, if you win, you can enter port to use your experience to upgrade you attack, defense, movement and/or gold-gathering abilities, install any talisman you have and/or, if you have the gold, upgrade to a better ship.

The game was available for PC, PlayStation 2 and Xbox. The game had a much slower pace than its predecessors which surprised and angered many PES fans but was welcomed by others who thought 4 was too fast. However it was the first to introduce the online mode on all consoles. The game was infamous for the referee halting play for very tedious fouls.",

Created by Double Fine\u0027s lead animator, Tasha Harris, the game follows the adventure of a group of young friends who must rid their neighborhood of monsters using only their wits, their bravery, and their home-made costumes. Players go door-to-door collecting candy, points, cards, battle stamps and quest assignments as they prepare themselves for Combat Mode-where they transform into larger-than-life versions of their costumes. Each costume that comes-to-life provides its own unique set of superpowers that players will need to battle Halloweens worst monsters.",

You must also find exits in each area in order to advance to the next level.\n\nThe spider is always equipped with a Slasher leg and webbing, and he is capable of enhancing his fighting ability with weapons by collecting power-ups. The weapons include homing missiles, flame throwers, boomerangs, and electro-beams.

The action is split into four worlds. In each of the first three worlds, the Scarecrow, Tin Man, and Lion can be found, while in the last rather than gain a companion the witch must be fought. After gaining a companion, the characters may be switched on the fly, and each companion has significantly different attacks and abilities. Several of the levels require using a combination of all of these abilities to fully explore. The game also includes a variety of mini-games which gives the player a chance to play as Toto also. \n \nAll levels can be revisited once passed and doing so required both for the purposes of stocking up on items and to find the Emerald City tickets which are required to enter the final area.",

A legend telling about the Fire Brigands lead by the mysterious Fire Champion who united the Grassland nations is being spread around.

Nash, a special agent of Holy Kingdom of Harmonia\u0027s Southern Fringe Security Force, is sent to investigate the matter.\n\nYou take control over Nash\u0027 actions in a fashion similar to the one implemented in Japanese \"dating sims\" or some hentai games: reading the text, looking at the background images, and sometimes interfering and choosing the path on which the story should proceed.",

At the time of its release, the game received relatively high praise. It was particularly praised for its smoothness of gameplay and the quality of graphics at the time.\n\nMuch like another sports title published around the same time, Brian Lara Cricket 99, the commentary is of great note amongst certain gaming circles. Supplied by ex-television broadcasters Bill Beaumont and Bill McLaren, the commentary includes oft-hilarious and memorable lines, such as \"Oh! Mercy me! What a tackle! That could\u0027ve put him in Ward 4!\", followed by \"I hope not Bill, that\u0027s a maternity ward!\". One particularly quirky piece of commentary is the line \"digging in like a demented mole there\", which refers to players hurling themselves into rucks. The two commentators were seen to have a great level of banter with one another, adding to the flow and realism of the game.",

    "summary": "Paradox Error is a surreal take on the scrolling platformer format, combining minimalistic black-and-white presentation with self-aware, fourth wall breaking design. Glitches are intentionally integrated, allowing the player to cheat death, open new areas by triggering bugs or leap off of UI elements as if they’re part of the stage. The title screen’s main menu acts as a respawn hub, cursors may appear as enemies or helpful guides, graphical errors obscure parts of the screen and the player’s character explodes into pixels upon death. To survive, you’ll have to quickly identify which portions of the screen can be reached, which pixels can be touched and which ones are simply background art. Adapt as gameplay suddenly shifts to a different perspective or requires interaction with a glitched object to proceed. At its core, Paradox Error is an ever-changing environmental puzzle where you’re expected to die repeatedly and use those failures to inform further attempts, until the goal is eventually within reach. Decidedly hardcore in difficulty but fair enough to encourage repeated play, this is an exercise in trial-and-error, where determination becomes its own reward.",

The harder the beatdown Neon dishes out, the stronger they become, until they\u0027re a nigh unstoppable snowball of devastation. The catch? This power wears off when you\u0027re hit even once. Neon is incredibly fast and powerful, but can only maintain that extreme potential when they\u0027re avoiding damage and continuously dishing it out.\n\nLike Celeste? You can use its dash twice! Go nuts. Avoid everything. Counterattack through your enemies. Heck, wavedash jump cancel™ if you want.\n\nLike Smash Bros? Well we\u0027ve got platform-fighter style combat here, so knock your foes around and KO them with that satisfying offscreen explosion!\n\nCombat lets you cancel virtually everything into everything else! Make your own combos! Hit, stun and run! Start up that combo with a dash! Unleash a barrage of punches like it\u0027s an anime reference! Teleport* behind the enemy and end them with a break attack!",

The tank can move in 8 directions. The fire button causes the tank to shoot in the direction it is moving. On each screen, there are active and dormant enemy tanks. As the screens progress, the tanks are worth more and more, but the dormant tanks are always worth twice as much as the active ones. Of course they are well guarded! The scenery consists of a few trees and a river which you can only cross by bridge. If you shoot an active tank, one of the dormant tanks will spring to life and come after you. The object of the game is to clear the level and go on to the next one before they kill you. Each succeeding level has more enemies, and moves faster and faster. The game plays a tune at the start of each level, and then there is a JAWS-like tune that it plays as you play. As the battle gets more and more frantic, so does the music. The tank makes a simple but interesting sound that is unique to this game. It is a sort of rumbling sound that you\u0027d expect, but it has a squeaky sound like metal or ball-bearings grinding.",

Well, regardless of the intelligence of the decision, Bugs and Taz will have to work together on this mission, traveling through four different eras in a quest to find Daffy, recover the Time Gem and set things back to the way they ought to be. \n \nTake control of the two famous Warner Bros. characters in Bugs Bunny \u0026 Taz: Time Busters for the PlayStation. You will alternate between the wise-cracking rabbit and the Tasmanian eating machine in an attempt to rescue the Time Crystal and Daffy. To do so, they\u0027ll have to use the Time Regulator themselves, blasting back through four different eras to complete their quest. These time periods are The Aztec Era, The Viking Era, The Arabian Era and Transylvanian Era. \n \nEach character has his own set of moves, from Bugs\u0027 quickness to Taz\u0027s spinning fury. You can play each of the characters at any point, calling your friend to your location and switching between them, occasionally using them at nearly the same time to get past a given obstacle.

A player can guess a letter and if that letter is in the puzzle, those spaces are flipped to reveal the letter and the player earns the cash amount specified by the wheel spin, multiplied by the number of occurrences of the letter. Only English consonants can be guessed-- the 5 English vowels can be purchased using a player\u0027s earnings.",

Those who rebel against the coalition take on a purely militant view, coming to the opinion that the only way to bring peace is by ultimately crushing all who oppose them - especially xenos. \n \nFor the first time in their history, the war creates a schism in the Advent Unity. The loyalists seek to continue their policy of revenge against the Traders, and to assimilate all others to the Unity’s influence. However, others amongst the Advent suspect that a corrupting influence from within has diverted the Unity from its proper destiny. \n \nThe divide created in the Vasari Empire is less pronounced, but just as severe to their people. With the Vasari now practically frantic to move on to new space, the loyalist faction abandons cooperation and decides to take the resources they need by any means necessary. Having accepted the need to work together, the rebel faction feels that their best chance for survival is to work with the other races and bring them along to flee the approaching enemy. \n \nTake the battle for galactic supremacy to its ultimate level in Sins of a Solar Empire: Rebellion – a standalone RT4X game that combines the tactics of real-time strategy with the depth of the 4X genre (eXplore, eXpand, eXploit, eXterminate).",
