In the middle of the screen is a power bar which gets filled by holding the assigned button - if the bar is too low the athlete gets slow and if it is too high he gets tired. Practically this results in steady button pressing to keep it as high as possible. During the shooting sequences the player shoots on targets while the cursor is wobbling. He can also hold his breath for a short time to steady his aim. \n \nIn the career mode the player divides points into four categories, e.g. speed or stamina, which influence the athlethe's capabilities. After successful championships he can improve these stats further. New in this instalment are super-powers which can be chosen at some point. When activated these give a big boost on a stat for a short time, e.g. \"mountain skiing\" boosts power when skiing uphill. These are available once per race. There are overall 15 courses which are partly licensed.","tags":[268435470,536871747]},{"id":75648,"cover":{"id":97218,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co230i.jpg"},"name":"Brink of Extinction","platforms":[{"id":6,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}],"screenshots":[{"id":133894,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/bdzvrnjgfxayerfesrlf.jpg"},{"id":133895,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/y2wamb8vh6ojqlewpmm3.jpg"},{"id":133896,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/kfiwvd1d12r0bd3us9jb.jpg"},{"id":133897,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/szvypkgo8zm5fwqe8t9y.jpg"},{"id":133898,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/ujfuki9ksdxteamgxxe9.jpg"}],"summary":"Brink of Extinction is a challenging tower defense game set in the ruins of human civilization. \n \nBattle swarms of insects over 15 campaign levels and 6 endless mode levels.

Gameplay also included an in-game sidebar code called Soylent Green Mode.

In other cases, the briefing text is shown. The FMVs include a general for each side, telling the player the mission objectives; The Allied General Carville later appears in Red Alert 2 while Soviet General Topolov has made no further appearances in the Red Alert series.","tags":[39,268435467,268435471,536872383,536875284,536876240,536877382,536880542,536881200,536883812]},{"id":31977,"cover":{"id":188264,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co419k.jpg"},"name":"Ghost Pursuit VR","platforms":[{"id":6,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}],"screenshots":[{"id":51018,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/atuu6rogxu2ykwi6rplq.jpg"},{"id":51019,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/dpwsltxlgrqjf3xke7qx.jpg"},{"id":51020,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/gxbo378gcs7jas2nmytk.jpg"},{"id":51021,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/dqrp1vgkmzhmay1vjk8u.jpg"},{"id":51022,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/c7m0scpuhrctdgffdtk5.jpg"}],"summary":"Ghost Pursuit VR is a new generation Pac-Man, with a touch of Bomberman.

The game is the sequel to cult video game ToeJam & Earl, released in 1991. The game concerns two alien protagonists, ToeJam and Earl, both of whom have escaped from Earth, where they had crash landed. After returning to their home planet of Funkotron, the duo discover a number of antagonistic Earthlings have stowed away on the spacecraft and are wreaking havoc across the planet. The player must hunt down these Earthlings and imprison them in jars before sending them back to Earth.\nThe game's platform format was a departure from the original ToeJam & Earl, a treasure hunt game with randomly generated levels, inspired by the game Rogue. Creators Greg Johnson and Mark Voorsanger originally began designing a game built on the concepts of the original, but changed to a more generic type of game due to a lack of support for their vision on the part of Sega. The game was critically well received, with reviewers praising the graphics, soundtrack, fluid action and two-player mode. It was also a commercial success, but fans of ToeJam & Earl were disappointed and confused by the radical change in direction.\nSince its release ToeJam & Earl in Panic on Funkotron has been criticized for being too sharp a departure from the first game, and some later reviewers felt that the developers had been more interested in the publisher's wishes than the fans. Johnson and Voorsanger have stated they regret moving away from their prototype sequel in the vein of ToeJam & Earl. Research has suggested that a significant minority of fans favor ToeJam & Earl in Panic on Funkotron as the best in the series. Together with its predecessor, the game comprises one of the Mega Drive's \"key exclusive franchises\", which eventually spawned a third installment in 2002, albeit a commercial failure with mixed reviews. ToeJam & Earl in Panic on Funkotron was re-released in 2007 for the Wii's Virtual Console, receiving mixed reviews. The game was released on PlayStation Network and Xbox Live Arcade alongside its prequel in November 2012.

Originally developed as an expansion pack to Terminator: Future Shock, SkyNET eventually became its own standalone product. Its major features are an updated version of the Xngine allowing for play in the sharper 640x480 resolution (and the ability to update Future Shock to the same), a new single-player campaign, and a new multiplayer deathmatch component.\n\nIn the single-player game, you must stop the machines from launching a recovered nuclear weapon. The story takes place over seven missions broken into various sections and \"levels,\" with night progressing into daylight as the game goes on. The locations are also more varied and interactive than those featured in the first game, with levels like the basement of the Cyberdyne building, and a sinking nuclear submarine. Driving and flying levels return from Future Shock, as do the mission briefings, which are now handled entirely in FMV. The game seems to act as a prequel to Future Shock, with the most advanced technology and player weapons from that game not appearing in the course of the single-player missions in SkyNET.\n\nThe multiplayer game allows for eight players over a LAN and two over IPX. The levels are contained recreations of sections or ideas in the single-player game, like a block of cityscape, a shattered freeway, or an open valley, and many can be played at either dawn or dusk. Vehicles are available in most levels, and unlike in single-player, can be entered and exited freely. You also have the option to play as a Terminator, with reduced movement speed, a little more toughness, and the classic red-tinted vision with information overlays.","tags":[1,18,268435461,536870981,536871365,536871378,536871835,536871882,536871937,536872009,536872179,536873999,536874947,536875242,536875483,536875492,536875572,536876028,536877443,536879870,536885929],"videos":[{"id":3296,"video_id":"Lj6adjtUmdE"}]},{"id":122518,"cover":{"id":114762,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co2gju.jpg"},"name":"NinNinDays","platforms":[{"id":6,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"},{"id":130,"name":"Nintendo Switch"}],"screenshots":[{"id":334755,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc76ar.jpg"},{"id":334756,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc76as.jpg"},{"id":334757,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc76at.jpg"},{"id":334758,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc76au.jpg"},{"id":334759,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc76av.jpg"}],"summary":"A sullen main character and a clumsy female ninja living together?!

Unique to Heat the Soul 3 are \"Soul Road\" and \"Karakura Heroes.\" In Soul Road, the player is to select the desired character and partner character. Afterwards, the player is set on a board game-like map where the goal is to pass through markers in order to fight enemies. After each match, the player is given an amount of \"Trust points\" (how many received depends on the mode's difficulty) which go towards leveling up partner characters and unlocking bonuses, such as alternate costumes and new partners. To unlock these bonuses, the player must find a blue marker to turn in their points; however, before doing so, the player must answer a multiple choice question. In Karakura Heroes, the player is put into a humorous side-story, with some extra anime scenes added. Don Kanonji leads a group of shinigami, initially Byakuya Kuchiki and Tōshirō Hitsugaya, on some sort of wacky adventure which involves battling several other characters.

The game employs a modified version of id Software's id Tech 2 engine—originally used for Quake 2—and incorporates music from films by director Wong Kar-wai, which were originally performed by Xavier Cugat. Four incarnations of the game were produced during its one-year development; the first featured more common first-person shooter elements than the released version. Subsequent versions shifted in a new direction, with the inclusion of more spy-oriented gameplay.\n\nGravity Bone received critical acclaim from video game journalists. It was called \"a pleasure to experience\" by Charles Onyett from IGN, and received comparisons to games such as Team Fortress 2 and Portal. The game was praised for its cohesive story, atmosphere and its ability to catch the player's interest over a very short time span without feeling rushed or incomplete. It received the \"Best Arthouse Game\" award in Game Tunnel's Special Awards of 2008. A sequel, Thirty Flights of Loving, was released in 2012.","tags":[20,27,31,268435464,268435469,268435487,268435488,536870953,536871029,536871041,536871044,536871183,536871470,536871752,536871939,536872010,536872048,536872064,536872131,536872287,536872746,536873137,536873362,536874743,536874813,536875059,536875073,536875089,536875090,536875110,536875131,536875151,536875217,536875242,536875271,536875275,536875315,536875325,536875330,536875358,536875506,536875523,536875524,536875525,536875536,536875537,536875538,536875690,536875696,536875700,536875745,536875822,536875880,536876016,536876083,536876084,536876126,536876298,536876356,536876461,536876466,536876649,536876833,536877373,536877533,536877587,536877647,536877726,536878032]}]
