However, the English version of the game was never released due to distribution problems, and the Xbox version remained only in Japan as had previously happened with the original Dreamcast version. \n \nIn 2008, the unreleased English-translated version of the game got leaked and appeared on torrent sites in an apparently complete state, with only minor text errors present. This version was very close to completion and was reviewed by GamePro and Electronics Gaming Monthly in February 2003.","tags":[1,18,27,268435468,268435481,268435487,536871308,536871851],"videos":[{"id":47603,"video_id":"Kx-WlrNMnI0"}]},{"id":31401,"cover":{"id":58210,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/w9jquapu6kdm1ohqbwtu.jpg"},"name":"Bullets And More VR - BAM VR","platforms":[{"id":6,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}],"screenshots":[{"id":47867,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/zt28ey1gasx75qf3ahah.jpg"},{"id":47868,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/qycw8ftgdy51tupqdm1v.jpg"},{"id":47869,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/ju9hyuujswjuexcwxcdz.jpg"},{"id":47870,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/ix7f332k0o04onvq9tjo.jpg"},{"id":47871,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/lscdoasfca68n4obt7wt.jpg"}],"summary":"Jump into a massive multiplayer experience with up to 12 players in about 20 different maps and various different game modes (Deathmatch, Team Deathmatch, Capture The Flag, Virus Infection, Gun Game and Classic Deathmatch).

It was finally released on July 28th 2017, 5 years after the original Japanese release date.\n\nDeveloped in cooperation with neuroscientist Dr Ryuta Kawashima, the idea behind Devilish Brain Training - the third game in a franchise which has sold more than 15 million copies across Europe to date - is to train your grey matter by completing a series of challenging exercises.\nThe gameplay puts emphasis on concentration skills and training your working memory - an important brain function based around the temporary storage of information for manipulation.\nThrough playing each exercise for a few minutes per day over the course of several weeks, you will be able to monitor the improvements in your focus\n\nDevilish Brain Training offers 30 exercises and minigames, including 18 which are brand new, with the core exercises dynamically adapting to create tailored training programmes. For example, Devilish Calculations challenges you to recall the answer to a previous mathematical problem while paying attention to the next one in line. The questions come thick and fast and you have to concentrate hard while remembering specific information to make sure you don’t make any mistakes.\nAnother minigame, Devilish Mice challenges you to simultaneously track the path of several mice while they are being chased by cats. It sounds simple, but the exercise requires much concentration!\nIf you struggle with the exercise, the game will dynamically adjust the difficulty level based on your real-time results. By offering a stiff challenge and shifting the difficulty to match your performance, Devilish Brain Training will constantly push you to stay focused and access short-term memories.\n\nThe game will be available as a download on Nintendo eShop,","tags":[34,268435465,536871115,536871446,536871826],"videos":[{"id":2155,"video_id":"r1edTgRERP4"}]},{"id":1024,"cover":{"id":94904,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co2188.jpg"},"name":"Hacker Evolution: Untold","platforms":[{"id":3,"name":"Linux"},{"id":6,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"},{"id":14,"name":"Mac"}],"screenshots":[{"id":38993,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/mhuqt7yn9roij5qjrlc8.jpg"},{"id":38994,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/fp8vwwdikhd2nzcj88xq.jpg"},{"id":38995,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/mp2jlvtnynoqqrlaqsjx.jpg"},{"id":38996,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/m35appbhqeimqsjtud7b.jpg"},{"id":38997,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/uka9k4y3v2krrkwfsknh.jpg"}],"summary":"When the number of computers in existence and their processing capacity exceeds that of all mankind, a point of technological singularity is encountered.

With more depth than a 4X, broader exploration than an RTS, and more purpose than a Space Simulator Rank: Warmaster combines the best aspects of all three genres into a smooth blend to create a unique experience. If you've ever wished for a true multi-genre space game where you can take on any role from the commander of an empire down to the pilot of a singular ship, and to switch between them at any time, then Rank: Warmaster is the game for you!","tags":[18,39,41,268435467,268435469,268435471,268435488],"videos":[{"id":49412,"video_id":"LMIGKXiC-Q0"}]},{"id":84912,"cover":{"id":62319,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/prmr2qgwf3z7j6nyw9pf.jpg"},"name":"Sudoku 50!

Unfortunately the prince stands a little less than half a foot tall, so recreating the stars will require some effort. Enter the Katamari, a sphere the prince can push around our world to “roll up” items increasing the Katamari’s size until it’s suitable for the King.\n\nTaking place in stylized versions of Japanese houses, cities, and environs, the prince pushes the Katamari around collecting items which adhere to it. At first, the prince can only pick up smaller items, but as the Katamari grows, the more it can collect. Push pins and paper clips cling to the Katamari increasing its size so it can roll over obstacles and pick up bigger items. Over many levels, the Katamari can eventually pick up people, cars, and other bigger items.\n\nPlayers steer the Katamari from a third-person perspective using the analog sticks on the PS2. A tutorial stage takes the player through the controls and sets up the story as well as introducing a side story about a Japanese girl who can feel the cosmos. Wanting to challenge the prince, the King sets requirements on the Katamari’s size and sets time limits on the level. Bonus missions restore constellations and have their own restrictions.\n\nThe world of Katamari Damacy is brought to life with off-beat animation and a catchy soundtrack. Players can find presents hidden in the levels that contain accessories for the prince. Two players can also battle head-to-head in a Katamari competition.","tags":[17,27,268435465,268435487,536871029,536871159,536871208,536871262,536871570,536871672,536872211,536872339,536872695,536872847,536873111,536873137,536873249,536873787,536874706,536874896,536875055,536875094,536875098,536875100,536875102,536875151,536875216,536875253,536875301,536875364,536875396,536875433,536875465,536875537,536875580,536875713,536875768,536875792,536875921,536876176,536876332,536876414,536876510,536876666,536877058,536877101,536877305,536877311,536877390,536877813,536878100,536878103,536878222,536878512,536878562,536878600,536879875,536880331,536880500,536880805,536880843,536880943,536881315,536882676,536882807,536884022,536886046,536886310,536888127,536891467,536891468],"videos":[{"id":2333,"video_id":"902rTNws7rU"},{"id":37725,"video_id":"BAtuIRy2mL4"}]},{"id":54453,"cover":{"id":108303,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co2bkf.jpg"},"name":"Hard Time","platforms":[{"id":6,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"},{"id":14,"name":"Mac"},{"id":34,"name":"Android"},{"id":39,"name":"iOS"}],"screenshots":[{"id":117791,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/rmtoymoaarbeqjtwwvtr.jpg"},{"id":117792,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/yufn72glwnpe81ax2dri.jpg"},{"id":117793,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/dnlq9ufktr1fqcieiyjk.jpg"},{"id":117794,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/j7zikl3s9frt8tp9xorm.jpg"},{"id":117795,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/uyuysrgsxnlkujbkon1x.jpg"}],"summary":"Create your own convict and attempt to survive in a prison where every sentence threatens to be a \"death\" sentence!

It was part of the second series of bit Generations video games, and is simply just a basic puzzle video game. In the game, you'll be required to place three similarly colored tiles next to each other in order to rid of them. However, unlike most games like this, you don't swap the tiles but rather start to change the color of the tile by pressing on them with the cursor. \n \nEach step of the game the cursor will be one of the three colors that are in play.
