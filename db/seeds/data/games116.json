As John Spartan, the player will spend most of his time shooting endless waves of \"cryocons\" released upon the antiseptic world of the future. The standard weapon can be upgraded with a shotgun and magnum, both with limited ammo. Additionally, various types of grenades can be collected, which are thrown independently of the firearm.

The story begins in 1666, when a devil-worshipping cult called the Brotherhood of Hecate were conducting sinister experiments in London so as to take over the city and then the world. The Brotherhood tried to develop an elixir that would endow them with superhuman powers. However, rather than creating their intended superhumans, their experiments created only grotesque monsters. When they decided to use these creatures as an army of conquest, one of their number, Samuel Pepys, set their headquarters on fire, resulting in the First Great Fire of London. The game takes place in 1834 when London falls victim to several evil occurrences. Monster sightings are reported along with news of people mutating into ungodly creatures, and that the dead are waking from their graves and walking amongst the living.

Action-Strategy games are also called \"hybrids\" because they combine the FPS and RTS elements into the most engaging gaming experience available for the PC. Bionite: Origins integrates the key FPS and RTS elements into one seamless battle experience. Action-Strategy games are the most engaging games to play; because they require strategy to win, AND are fun to play because they include the First Person Shooter experience.\n\nThe game includes 3 maps; The Emze Mine (located on Venus), Biodome 24 (located on Mars), and Hadley’s Hope (located on the Moon). This release is a single player version against the computer (Skirmish mode) which involves destroying the enemy base before the enemy destroys your base. It is also intended to introduce gamers to the complex command system used in the game. There is a learning curve for Bionite: Origins and requires some time to develop the skills necessary to lead a successful campaign against the enemy. We like to think of the game as “Chess on Steroids”. It requires players to understand how to develop successful military strategies while relying on vehicle-driving skills to win and advance in rank.\n\nBionite: Origins took over 6 years to develop. There is no DLC, all of the content is included in the original release. All future releases of the game are free to people that already have a purchased copy of the game. When the Full Version of the game is released on Steam, everyone that purchased a copy of the game in Early Access will get the Fulll Version at no cost.

You still have to dodge bullets that are thrown at you, but you are unable to shoot at the boss to deal damage. Instead, you must use Aya's camera to take a certain amount of pictures of the boss. To assist the player, Aya's camera is capable of eliminating all of the bullets within the viewfinder when a shot is taken, even if the boss is not within the photo. The shot is considered successful when the boss is featured in the photo, and it will be given a score based on certain criteria including the amount and type of bullets in the photo. The bosses included in this game come from the games Embodiment of Scarlet Devil to Phantasmagoria of Flower View.","tags":[1,268435461,268435488,536870990,536871078,536871138,536871183,536871823,536872746,536873476,536873624,536874285,536874286,536874398,536875158,536875504,536876311,536877778,536878071,536878105,536879840,536880987,536881123],"videos":[{"id":12118,"video_id":"Lr11bEhRhNQ"}]},{"id":146436,"cover":{"id":138497,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co2yv5.jpg"},"name":"Starcosmic Bustout","platforms":[{"id":6,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}],"screenshots":[{"id":438951,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc9ep3.jpg"},{"id":438952,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc9ep4.jpg"},{"id":438953,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc9ep5.jpg"}],"summary":"Starcosmic Bustout it's a game similar to Arkanoid in which you need to clear the playfield of blocks by hitting a ball with the paddle positioned at the bottom of the screen.","tags":[268435489]},{"id":32969,"aggregated_rating":78.0,"cover":{"id":86046,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co1ue6.jpg"},"name":"Ghost 1.0","platforms":[{"id":6,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"},{"id":48,"name":"PlayStation 4"},{"id":49,"name":"Xbox One"},{"id":130,"name":"Nintendo Switch"}],"screenshots":[{"id":56623,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/bikaquqqrbsgnpr9pla5.jpg"},{"id":56624,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/btyxbgxfcybttqvgykin.jpg"},{"id":56625,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/xs1p9zk0k10eruf7p7jv.jpg"},{"id":56626,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/gycg9nxrjynenunbrsox.jpg"},{"id":56627,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/es7ycq4uxuteqhjvmpgp.jpg"}],"summary":"A mysterious agent, capable of becoming a digital ghost, sneaks aboard the Nakamura Space Station.
