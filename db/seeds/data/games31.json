The experience and progression in the game are all up to your play style and exploration abilities. There\u0027s always more than one way to get ahead. But be warned, the game will reward you for exploring, but you might find yourself ill-equipped to face head-on what you encounter. Some parts of the world may change according to your earlier actions in the game, even in an unexpected way.\n\nThe RPG mechanics of Höll Space 5D6 influence your character\u0027s physical movements and the use of tools and weapons, which might, in turn, unlock new ways to traverse the world.",

Like other puzzles of this type, hints next to each row and above each column tell you how many blocks of each color go in each row or column. By following these hints you can paint each part of the grid and reveal an image. However, these hints do NOT tell you the order they come in! \n \nSmaller puzzles ease you into this new way of thinking. You can work your way through 6 levels with 50 puzzles each, ranging in size from 5x5 to 15x10. Each puzzle lets you start with a randomly cleared row and column if you need a helping hand, but clearing puzzles without using hints earns you coins, which you can use to unlock Piczle Colors\u0027 many cool extra features!",

Three divisions of humankind share the same world - white-winged people who are called angels, black-winged people who are called devils, and wingless people.

The angels rule the world via a religious organization called the Prodevon Church, which ensures both the cooperation and ignorance of the wingless people.",

The main character, Chihiro Enomoto, was chosen by lot as a candidate for the next student council, and he and his partner had to undergo rigorous training and trials in order to become a member of the next student council.\n\nThe main part of the game is a 3D action that goes through an automatically generated dungeon in Ryubashiin Gakuen. If you choose one of your favorite characters before the start of the stage, subcharacters will follow and you will move on to the stage with a total of three people. A partner may initially be in a blunt \"tsun\" state, but regaining a damaged partner can increase his/her popularity, and a \"dere\" state can give him/her an advantage in the progress of the game.",

Working as a night-watchman at a partially abandoned, secret research facility, you are knocked unconscious by a nearby explosion. Waking in the complex’s basement you look up and see a gaping hole in the ceiling. Escaping the damaged building is only the start of your troubles and as you begin to explore the base you encounter strange, unearthly organisms. Is this all because of some sort of biological experiment gone wrong? You’ll need to fight for survival as you unravel the mysteries and solve the problems that lie ahead.",

Developed with NIH support, Brush Up wins health gaming  awards (like the 2015 Innovation in Games and Simulation award from America’s prestigious Institute of Medicine) for teaching young children toothbrush mastery.  While the mixed reality game is a bathroom companion, the VR game is a fun exploration of dentition. Kids learn that brushing means a lot more than cleaning the front teeth plus a quick scrub down one side. see Brush Up VR Playthrough  (0:26) Designed for young people of any age -- the brushing challenge is lively fun for anyone.",

Styled after games like Galaga, the player controls a spaceship and can shoot at aliens in their path, each representing a random file on the player\u0027s computer. Destroying an alien causes the file to be deleted, potentially corrupting the player\u0027s operating system, while dying causes the game itself to be deleted.

Witness an inner universe and actively participate in this unusual saga, which may lead you to follow other directions. \n \nBut don\u0027t think that this will be an easy task! You will experience immersion in a virtual environment where you must interact freely with the objects and beings that live there. Your mission in search of the Supra-Reality will be arduous, you will have to follow the path that the Artists and Philosophers of the Surrealist Universe have followed. Be careful, you can reach places that are not so welcoming. \n \nIt is up to you to discover the secrets of this exotic environment, for this you will have the help of strange beings who may be willing to help you. There will be times when your skills will be put into practice, reasoning, intelligence, inspiration, agility and a good sense of exploration are some of the ingredients that you must take to venture into Surreality. \n \nCulture, Art, Entertainment and Knowledge come together to form an authentic Surrealist experience in an inhospitable and unknown world called Unconscious.",

First, the intermission image, which incorporates the cover art from the unlicensed Hungarian novel Doom - Tisztítótűz, was recreated using instead the Eisen character from Quake Champions (specifically, the Eisen skin variant featuring a cap and an eyepatch).

The five locations in the adventure include St. Petersburg, a palace, a train, a ship and Paris. In each place, Pooka has a specific task that will help Anya reach her goal, ranging from contacts with Dmitri to creating passports and helping a Prima Ballerina find her lucky ballet slippers. Throughout the journey, you must also avoid Rasputin\u0027s minions who will zap Pooka into the underworld and make him play deadly games to escape. While underground, Pooka is challenged to several games including Doggy Dodge (dodge rocks), Minion Mosh (a jumping game similar to Fox and Geese), Skull Toss (bowling-like game using Rasputin\u0027s denizens as targets) and Hidden Maze. In the latter, you see a maze for a short time and then try and guide Pooka safely through to the other side. Between locations, you hear entries from Anya\u0027s diary and after the game is completed, you\u0027re rewarded with screenshots from the movie. Anastasia\u0027s voiceover features actress Meg Ryan who had the same role in the animated movie. Can you help Anya find out who her parents are and escape the clutches of Rasputin?

But the scrolling platformer is only part of the experience. Spyro Orange focuses on dozens of mini-challenges for its gameplay, like a vertical shooter where Spyro floats around blasting sheep or collecting gems, a rapid-button-tapping challenge involving tug-o-war and ice cube creation, or driving around in a tank, or knocking out a series of bad guys in a Breakout-style challenge.

Luckily, Bob has a subconscious guardian named Subob, whom spawns from the mind of Bob and whose job it is to protect the sleepwalker from any danger and guide him back to the safety of his bed.\n\nThe ever vigilant Subob must guide the constantly sleepwalking Bob on a journey through a series of surreal painting-like cityscapes where the boundary between Bob\u0027s dreams and reality have vanished, as Subob is part of Bob\u0027s subconsciousness. The result is an artistic dream world that is recognizable, yet totally different from the real world, where many things are not what they seem and dangers to the sleepwalker lurks deeper in.",

    "summary": "Soldat (meaning \"soldier\" in Italian, German, Russian, Norwegian, Danish, Swedish, French, Catalan and Romanian) is a Polish 2D multiplayer game for Windows. It is a side-scroller inspired by Liero and Scorched Earth, combined with elements from Counter-Strike and Worms. The game is shareware. Registration unlocks extra aesthetic options, such as colored jet flames and custom interfaces. Version 1.5.0 also includes a minimap and changeable screen resolution for registered users.\nSoldat is written and maintained by programmer Michał Marcinkowski, who started working on the game in November, 2001. It is coded in the Delphi programming language using the JEDI libraries. Though Marcinkowski is the primary developer, he works with a few others on the dedicated server and lobby, in addition to a small beta team which aids in testing prior to new releases.",

Instead of the standard GameCube controllers, the game is intended to be played with a special controller called the DK Bongos that resemble two small bongo drums. \n \nDonkey Konga was developed by the same team of people who made the Taiko: Drum Master series for the PlayStation 2. The tracks include hits such as \"Louie Louie\", \"We Will Rock You\", \"Shining Star\", \"Rock Lobster\" and \"Losing My Religion\". There are tracks from the Mario series, the The Legend of Zelda series and other Nintendo related music. All regional variants of the game have differing track listings, and in the North American version of both games, almost all of the licensed non-Nintendo/traditional songs are shortened covers.",

Players choose one of eight animated characters and prepare to compete against an assortment of colorful opponents whose fortresses must be breached. The object is to break a series of bricks by smashing a ricocheting ball into them using a horizontal paddle. \n \nThe default view is presented from an angled top-down perspective, but players can switch to a perspective right behind the paddle for a more 3D feel. New twists on the classic gameplay include the ability to bounce the ball over barriers as well as earn a special power-up by scoring a certain number of points.",
