The placing player may not use a follower to claim any features of the tile that extend or connect features already claimed by another player. However, it is possible for terrain features claimed by opposing players to become \"shared\" by the subsequent placement of tiles connecting them. For example, two field tiles which each have a follower can become connected into a single field by another terrain tile.\n\nThe game ends when the last tile has been placed. At that time, all features (including fields) score points for the players with the most followers on them. The player with the most points wins the game.",

The environment is full of mysterious and hostile shadow creatures, and the only way to survive will be to gather resources used to craft and researching new weapons and technologies.\n\nThe world is sunk in permanent darkness and the shadow creatures surrounding you are only sensitive to the light, and plays a key role in the battle against the dark. You will have to use your strategic skills to build up new facilities which will allow you to progress further and explore the vast landscape. Darkout brings a completely new experience to the player, frenetic, distressing and graphically far superior to what has been seen before in the sandbox genre.",

In order to win, the player is required to match up tiles by finding \"free\" tiles of the same type. \n \nFor instance, some tiles have numbers and some have pictures; the object is to find a tile not restricted, blocked, or under another tile. Once a player matches up two tiles of the same type, they are removed and the pyramid is reduced. By removing tiles, previously restricted tiles may be opened up. Gameplay flows in this fashion until there are no more tiles or a stalemate. Stalemates are very common and occur when there are no possible matches or moves remaining.",

However, during a routine maintenance check, something went terribly wrong...\n\nWhile most of the survivors form scavenger bands to survive, one group of people, who refer to themselves as \"The Project\", seeks to rebuild civilization using pre-war technology.\n\nWarzone 2100 is a real-time strategy game, originally developed by Pumpkin Studios and published by Eidos Interactive, now developed by the Warzone 2100 Project. Compared to other real-time strategy games, it has a greater focus on artillery, radar, and counter-battery technologies, more frequent in-game cinematic updates as game play progresses, a massive research tree, as well as a vehicle design system.\n\nOutside of the story, Warzone 2100 only has a single faction. This limits some of the variety that can be expected from real-time strategy games, although the single faction is very complex. Essentially, Warzone 2100 plays much like Earth 2150 with 3D units and terrain, customizable vehicles, a lack of traditional infantry, use of \"research\" to acquire new technologies, and the differentiation of vehicles types.",

Released shortly after the Columbine High School massacre, the game attracted controversy which led it to be dropped from various retailers, despite receiving moderate critical acclaim. \n \nThe soundtrack for Kingpin was provided by the rap group Cypress Hill, and featured three tracks from their album IV. They were: \n \n- 16 Men Till There\u0027s No Men Left \n- Checkmate \n- Lightning Strikes \n \nAlongside the full versions of these tracks, instrumental versions with the vocals removed were used as backing tracks. Cypress Hill also provided some of the voice acting for the game.",

    "summary": "Just like its predecessors Need for Speed: High Stakes is an action racing game with a wide selection of exotic sports cars and many different types of tracks. The trademark Hot Pursuit mode game mode from the first game in the series is still present, where players race opponents on tracks filled with regular traffic and police cars that chase the racers. The classic pursuit mode is extended with two additional modes: Getaway and Time Trap. In Getaway the player needs to shake off the police in a set amount of time, or playing as the police trap a speeder before time runs out. In Time Trap an entire race needs to be completed before time runs out, or as the police all speeders need to be arrested. There are minor differences between the two platforms for this game mode, regarding spike strips, road blocks, and back-up. The latter for instance is unique to the PlayStation version. The Pursuit mode is available in multiplayer as well and players can take different sides or race together. \n \nIt is the first game in the series to introduce a Career mode with a set of challenges. Beating these is rewarded with trophies for unlocks, and money to spend on new cars, repairs and upgrades. In the PlayStation version the Career mode is split up into two different sets of challenges: Tournament (required races) and Special Event (optional races). High Stakes in the title refers to races where players bet their cars. In the PC version these are a part of the Career mode when the player owns more than two cars. In the PlayStation version two players can insert their memory cards and race against each other. The winner immediately receives the opponent\u0027s car and it is deleted from the loser\u0027s memory card right away. \n \nIn addition to the new game modes it is also the first game in the series to have a detailed physics models. Damage now affects both the appearance and the performance of the car for the first time.",

The game takes advantage of the Wii\u0027s motion-sensitive controls to let players cast and reel just as they would in real life, and each of the 40 fish species fights and flees like its real-world counterpart. When gamers are satisfied with their catch they can head back to the lodge, where the Fishing Master doles out expert advice and showcases the new equipment players have earned. Angler\u0027s Dream also strays into life development sim territory, because the lodge includes a number of aquariums where gamers can care for and rear their most prized catches. The ultimate goal for solo players is to track down the rare and elusive Legendary Fish, but those looking for multiplayer action can join up to three friends in the competitive \"Versus\" mode.",

And you\u0027re wishing you brought more water along for the ride... \n \nOff-road racing is a test of speed and survival. First you pick your challenge: The Georgia Mud Fest, The Michigan Winter Wreck-Off, the Death Valley Trek or the Baja Challenge. Then you choose a truck, customize it and stock it with tools. And survival supplies like food and water. Just in case. \n \nThose guys in fancy race suits don\u0027t use winches to lift rigs out of mud bogs. They don\u0027t change tires punctured by razor sharp cacti. And when it snows - they don\u0027t even have to race.

Featuring three different board games, RUGRATS: Scavenger Hunt utilizes the animation and humor from the cartoon series, and melds it into an original game that has players traipsing through 3D worlds looking for hidden objects. In \"The Pirate Treasure Hunt,\" the babies travel underwater in search of items; \"Angelica\u0027s Temple of Gloom\" challenges players to find bits of Stu\u0027s broken Aztec statues before Angelica can; and \"Reptar Rally\" has the babies collecting sweets in Candy Island. Once you choose your baby from a list that includes Tommy, Chuckie, Phil, or Lil, you begin using a spinner (just like a board game spinner) to determine how many spaces you\u0027ll advance. There are lots of trick spaces that give you advantages or disadvantages, like the Spike the Dog spot (which allows you to ride the pet for five spaces), and a Dil spot (which makes Dil come out and shuffle the board). Don\u0027t get too worked up though, as each baby has an energy meter, and if it hits zero you\u0027ll have to take a nap.",

    "summary": "The player controls Jack, a superhero who can leap and glide. Someone has planted 24 bombs at famous tourist sites (the Sphinx and Great Pyramids, the Acropolis, Neuschwanstein Castle in Bavaria, and two cityscapes resembling Miami Beach and Hollywood, which appear only as screen backgrounds rather than unique game locations). Jack must fly around the screen to collect the bombs. Each screen uses a different configuration of platforms upon which Jack may run and jump. Eventually, the levels reoccur a number of times with increasing difficulty.\n\nBomb Jack\u0027s arcade version\nJack \"defuses\" the bombs by simply touching them. As soon as he has touched the first, he triggers a sequence in which another bomb\u0027s fuse lights up, and so on. A player can score a bonus in each round by touching 20 or more bombs in the correct lit-fuse sequence. Jack may also defuse an unlit bomb by touching it, but this impedes his opportunity to score the bonus for that screen. It also delays the appearance of the game\u0027s bonuses and power-ups.\n\nBomb Bonuses are triggered when Jack touches the first of 24 onscreen bombs. It is possible to collect the remaining bombs in fuse order, the maximum being 23 (the top score possible on a level). Expert players would combine this with X5 \u0027b\u0027s for the largest multiplier score available.\n\nThe lit fuses have no strategic purpose other than the bonus; a lit bomb left unattended does not explode, although the onscreen enemies become faster the longer Jack is flying around and they eventually start to follow him at speed. At this point, new enemies appear in the form of flying saucers, that \u0027lock on\u0027 to Jack and are difficult to avoid.\n\nEnemies such as birds, mummies, turtles, and orbs float around the screen, making Jack lose a life if he touches them. Collecting bombs will increase the bonus meter at the top of the screen (collecting lit bombs increases it more). When the meter is completely filled up, a circular bouncing \"P\" appears, and when collected, it will turn all the enemies into bonus coins for a short period during which Jack may collect them. Other similar bonuses are the B (Bonus) which increases the score multiplier (up to 5x), the E (Extra) which gives an extra life, and the rare S (Special), which awards a free game. The Twin Galaxies highest scores for Bomb Jack on the MAME (arcade) platform are 73,378,560 on marathon settings, and 4,888,740 on tournament settings (5 lives only), achieved by Paul Kearns of London.",

Forced to run right, you\u0027ll encounter any number of monsters, allies, thieves and shops on your desperate journey to stop the end of everything.\n\nThe good news is that you don\u0027t just have access to one world. You have access to all of them. Born with the mysterious power to travel to other dimensions, you can choose which dimension you wish to travel to in order to get to the Demon Lord.\n\nDimensions vary based on their name. One might be full of lush forest landscapes full of adorable animals and cunning thieves, while another might be full of corrupted hellscapes infested with demons. You might find likeminded heroes willing to journey with you, or you might meet no one and be forced to venture into the unknown alone.\n\nLike a dimension you previously visited? Simply input the name at the Dimensional selection screen before you begin your journey. Want to try your luck with a random dimension? Type any word that pops into your head, and watch as One Way Heroics builds you a world based on the name you chose.\n\nInfinite permutations. Infinite worlds. Infinite adventure.",

This was the last NASCAR edition to be released exclusively on sixth generation consoles.\n\nThe NTSC game cover features Elliott Sadler, driver of the #38 M\u0026M\u0027s Ford Fusion. The PAL region game cover features Matt Kenseth\u0027s #17 DeWalt Power Tools Ford Fusion. This game is the first since NASCAR 2001 not to include a subtitle in the name. The game retains the teammate features introduced in NASCAR 06: Total Team Control, but does not add any major gameplay changes. However, the graphics include a blurring effect to attempt to give a better sense of high speed, and the pace of the gameplay has been sped up considerably. This is also the second EA Sports NASCAR video game to appear on a handheld system (first NASCAR 2000 for Game Boy Color). On the PlayStation Portable, the game is simply called NASCAR.",

The cover in the PAL region features Juan Pablo Montoya. NASCAR\u0027s new Car of Tomorrow as well as the current car are present in the game, although the Car of Tomorrow is generic (no separate manufacturers). ESPN\u0027s NASCAR coverage is also integrated into the game. Crew chief dialogue for the PS3 and 360 versions of the game was recorded by Chad Knaus. The Whelen Modified Tour is not included in the PS3 and 360 versions of the game, but is still present in the PS2 version.",

Lion-O begins the game equipped with the Sword of Omens (with the Eye of Thundera missing from the hilt) but has the option to switch throughout the game between the sword and a short range energy gun. In several levels, Lion-O will jump into a flying vehicle that can fire in a similar manner as the short range energy gun. The first four levels of the game are a part of the Garden of the Elementals, where the player may choose the order they play each of the themed levels, consisting of fire, water, air, and earth. \n \nEach level has a time limit to complete it; when it expires, Mumm-Ra appears and more goons and villains appear to make it tougher for Lion-O to finish.",

The PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 versions of the game were still made at the old studio.[5]\n\nDue to the development team using certain resources to work on key features in the game, no car manufacturers were present in this year\u0027s title.[6]\n\nTo date, this is the last NASCAR game to be produced by EA, and the last NASCAR game for the PlayStation 2, after suffering from slumping sales, the difficulty of installing new features, and the lack of popularity. In 2009, NASCAR Kart Racing was released, replacing any 2009 installment for the annual series. It may be EA\u0027s last game before their exclusive license with NASCAR expires. Yet the door to NASCAR games for the PlayStation 2 has been shut, as Polyphony Digital\u0027s Gran Turismo 5 was not featured for the sixth-generation console.\n\nFor game players in Canada, while the game was still released only in English, the instruction manual and box cover were bilingual, with text in both English and French.",

Now one of the human leaders, Lord Dominix, wants to start a war to wipe out all the \"bad-blooded\" mutants. Your village chief has assigned you with the task of preventing this war. \n \nBad Blood is a top-down action game with light role-playing elements. You can not create your own character but have to pick one of the three predefined ones: Varrigg (a strong green mutant who fights with his bare hands), Dekker (a human male armed with a knife) or Jakka (she looks human but can shoot laser beams from her eyes like Cyclops of X-Men fame). The choice you make has only a limited impact on gameplay and storyline. \n \nGameplay consists of exploring the world map, visiting several cities and villages, talking with NPCs, picking up items and new weapons (like shotguns, grenades, Uzis etc.) and lots of real-time combat. Bad Blood lacks character stats and character development. The game has a day-night cycle which influences the amount of monsters on the plains and whether or not you can talk with some NPCs.",

Shading to the sections marks out whether a corner or dive is coming up. There are 5 computer opponents to race against in one player mode, while a data link cable allows 2-player games. \n \nEach planet has its own atmosphere, and your machine\u0027s filters will need to be set to take account of this. Rain on some circuits necessitates a pitstop for a changeover. You are armed with afterburners, which can provide a speed use in open air but should not be overused. The Amiga version allows you to adjust the sensitivity of the controls - either way, joystick is easier to use but mouse is seen as ultimately being faster.",

Gold Rush! includes the three routes tens of thousands took to the gold regions. Become Jerrod Wilson and experience each trek as you travel from New York to California. \n \nWhichever route you decide to take, you will see many historical sights. Try going overland across the Great Plains and huge mountain ranges, crossing the Isthmus of Panama, or rounding Cape Horn on the tip of South America. If you survive and arrive at Sutter’s Fort, the adventure is still only half over! Many other puzzles remain to be solved before you achieve your goals in California.",

However, these dog days began to change with his chance meeting with the mysterious Inori, the Yuki-onna of Suzugaoka Gakuen. Soon after, he was invited by Ayano to the ‘ghost club’, which is actually not related to the occult, but rather a gathering place for people with regrets. He was made the new leader of the club despite his reluctance. \n \nBefore long, he was surrounded by peculiar girls left and right: cool lone wolf Inori, carefree repeater Ayano, smitten kouhai Hikari, and pushy ‘bro’ Wakaba.

Each of the formidable guardians —designed by Afro Samurai creator Takashi Okazaki— has a unique and surprising combat style that requires focus and skill to defeat.

The game has since been removed from Steam\u0027s storefront due to factors related to the developer\u0027s bankruptcy.\nThe game started off as a fan project of Paul Kamma and Sönke Seidel, the concept being inspired by various Half-Life 2 advertisements. Soon after, the two started working on Codename: Gordon on behalf of Nuclear Vision.

It\u0027s packed with a host of different elements, including survival, shooting, exploration, skills and much more, even including parkour! In short, it\u0027s a brand new gaming experience. The game tells the story of our future, after brain-computer interfacing technology has become highly advanced and human civilization has experienced another evolutionary leap, during which, great events have begun to unfold. Justice faces off against evil. The old stands against the new. And forces of conservatism clash with radicalism. \nIn this virtual world, all our heroes and heroines have acquired a “super power” through the help of quantum droids – the ability to turn quantum cube energy into any tactical support device they need. From Optical Camouflage to Quantum Barriers, from a detector that alerts you of approaching enemies, to a medical instrument that heals squad mates; anything and everything can be built, by you, and that\u0027s not all. You can choose whatever skills you think will help your strategy the most in any battle. \nWe\u0027ve even created a vertical combat concept. With parkour features including climbing, gliding, and rolling, players can experience vertical battles on a variety of terrain, including mountains, swamps and deserts. In this game, the arena that hosts your battles are not just a huge, flat map, but a world where you can fly in the sky and move underground. We have also created a number of exploration points scattered throughout the world. Here, you can explore temples in the desert with a chance of finding E-Cores to unlock new skills and weapons. Amid mounds of destroyed robots, you can also find gloves that greatly increase your climbing speed.",

    "summary": "Green Mirror is a 2D point-and-click horror adventure with clear Lovecraftian influences that combines the classic gameplay of these games with some new mechanics that enrich it, as well as exploration sections that will submerge us in possible secondary contents that are developed aside from the main story, complementing it. \n \nFollowing the disappearance of a family while hiking in the forests of Steelrock Canyon National Park, Dylan Riley, a veteran member of the search and rescue unit, suffers an accident that leaves him alone in the middle of the night and lost in an unexplored zone of the woods that has been closed to the public because of the dangers it may harbor. But... Is he really alone? Shadows glide through the trees, watching him, strange whispers accompany his steps like a creepy leitmotiv, and something that has inhabited those woods for eons wants to make it clear that he is not welcomed there. \n \nMain Features: \n \nAtmospheric exploration - The forest that covers the natural reserve like a green mantle hides many secrets and dangers buried by the time, that\u0027s the reason why many of its zones have been declared closed to the public. It\u0027s been a long time since the forgotten paths that wind through the undergrowth have been walked ... until now. \n \nPuzzle Solving - There are many hidden mysteries in the dark corners of Steelrock Canyon\u0027s forest waiting to be unveiled, old knowledge yearning to be pronounced again, and more complex motivations than it may seem at first. \n \nSurvive! - Take care of your wounds, seek help and escape the threats that wait for you in every corner. It seems as if the forest around you is alive ... and you can not trust it.",

A grave new threat has arisen in the North, a threat that seeks to seal off the Ten-Towns from the rest of Faerûn in a bitter power struggle. The town of Bremen has fallen, and a vicious horde of goblins, orcs, and bugbears have gathered beneath the mysterious banner of the Chimera and are marching on the port town of Targos. Fearing that they will be overrun, Targos has sent out a call for all able-bodied adventurers, soldiers, and mercenaries to sail north to stand with the town’s defenders against the encroaching horde. You and your companions have answered the call.",
