It's up to you to figure out their special abilities and moves.","tags":[1]},{"id":135931,"cover":{"id":111166,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co2dry.jpg"},"name":"Axis","platforms":[{"id":6,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}],"screenshots":[{"id":393582,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc8fou.jpg"},{"id":393583,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc8fov.jpg"},{"id":393584,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc8fow.jpg"},{"id":393585,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc8fox.jpg"},{"id":393586,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc8foy.jpg"},{"id":393587,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc8foz.jpg"},{"id":393588,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc8fp0.jpg"},{"id":393589,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc8fp1.jpg"},{"id":393590,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc8fp2.jpg"},{"id":393591,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc8fp3.jpg"},{"id":393592,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc8fp4.jpg"}],"summary":"Axis is a multiplayer first-person shooter with mechs. However, these are not the big and clunky robots usually featured in mech games, but fast machines which have the ability to float for a short amount of time. This means the game speed is more akin to mid-nineties shooters like Quake. The backdrop story is set in the 22th century when multinational companies fight over resources. \n \nThe game features overall eight multiplayer modes (e.g. Deathmatch, Rocket Arena or Gladiator) with differences regarding rules and winning conditions, but generally they all involve the player fighting alone against the opposition by running (and floating) around, shooting weapons at other players and picking up power-ups (e.g. armor, shields or damage multiplier) which spawn on the 28 maps. The basic stats of the player's mech, e.g. armor or the boost speed, are determined by the chosen pilot character and the used mech components which can be changed for arms, legs, chassis, head, booster and weapon load-out. All those components have strengths, weaknesses and weight, the latter being the restricting factor. \n \nThe game also has a single-player mode, skirmish, which consists of playing multiplayer matches against bots. Playing through the scenarios rewards additional mech components for use in multiplayer.","tags":[1,268435461,536871079,536873304],"videos":[{"id":38734,"video_id":"0Pc411eKnwU"}]},{"id":38661,"aggregated_rating":78.5,"cover":{"id":99410,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co24pe.jpg"},"name":"Reaching for Petals","platforms":[{"id":6,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}],"screenshots":[{"id":105664,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/gkh9ydlnmxincj7ctkg2.jpg"},{"id":105665,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/igrcgrv6ji72xqjwdukv.jpg"},{"id":105666,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/smdfsgmbxetjmh71jvnw.jpg"},{"id":105667,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/galhsrgzspkn5wpxbiwz.jpg"},{"id":105668,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/xx7xhx8fegdomy6mgcns.jpg"}],"summary":"Reaching for Petals is a poetic adventure about love, loss, and ambition.

When the game is first started, players are treated to a parody of the MGM logo featuring Momo instead of a lion and a \"Modoki\" instead of a mask. The game then cuts to a scene of a theater stage, where a play begins starring Momo, a young woman who gets super-powers. At this point the game puts the player in command of Momo. Rather than playing a hero who needs to save the world, the setting is that of a live stage show (set at the \"Namco Theater\"), and the player is actually controlling an actress who is merely playing the role of Momo/Wonder Momo. The game also features voice samples in Japanese.\n\nAs Momo, she can only attack using kicks, and in doing so builds up her \"Wonder\" meter. When she touches a tornado icon, or spins around by herself, she can turn into Wonder Momo and can also attack using the Wonder Hoop, which can be reused as long as she is Wonder Momo. After the Wonder Hoop is thrown, she won't be able to throw anymore, while she'll have to wait for it to bounce back to her. She can also shoot small waves of energy in whichever direction she faces (while she is crouching), which is based on the similar move by the Ultraman characters. Her most powerful attack is the Wonder Typhoon - a more powerful version of her small energy wave attack which shoots numerous amounts of small energy waves towards the left and right sides of the screen simultaneously, while she is spinning.\n\nThe game is notable for featuring some slightly risqué content for the time, in the form of fanservice (at Momo's expense). When Momo jumps, the player can visibly see her underwear. Momo also needs to be wary of photographers in the theatre audience, who are determined to get a peek under her miniskirt. If one is successful, Momo will get \"embarrassed\" (stunned) for a short period of time. Additionally, one of the images that appears on the theater curtain (at the beginning and end of some acts) is Momo wearing only a towel.","tags":[1,268435481,268435489,536871874,536885272]},{"id":64780,"cover":{"id":81226,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co1qoa.jpg"},"name":"The Space Sheriff Spirits","platforms":[{"id":8,"name":"PlayStation 2"}],"screenshots":[{"id":333340,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc757g.jpg"},{"id":333341,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc757h.jpg"},{"id":333342,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc757i.jpg"}],"summary":"The Space Sheriff Spirits, is an action game for the PlayStation 2.

Initially, the player has a small bakery and the amount of cash to dispose. \n \nAnd with time, along with the development of his bakery, taking care of acquiring new customers and expanding his stores, the player gains new opportunities. In the future, the player will be able to expand his company with new and larger bakeries, which will significantly increase production possibilities. And by introducing new products to its offer, it can increase revenues in such stores and thus increase its profits. The player also has marketing campaigns at his disposal, which can significantly affect the number of customers in the player's stores. The number of customers and by the volume of sales can also be influenced by high-quality products, thanks to which the player can win occasional bakery festivals that take place from time to time. \n \nAnd with such a strong position, the player can conquer new markets in other cities, creating their warehouses and new stores there. On the other hand, however, the player has full freedom in action. It can focus on the production of the cheapest products and reach as many customers as possible. \n \nThe game itself is designed so that in each of the \"modules\" I can add functions and add depth to game features. And so far, the game does not yet contain all the functions and mechanics that I would like to see in this game. But mainly add depth to the production mechanics about production lines. Whether as part of the purchase of \"technology\" or building your own production line. I also think a lot about the introduction of the logistics module. It would be naturally connected to the warehouse. This would allow the introduction of delivery elements to the game. Purchase of delivery vehicles and possible plans for the supply stores. And that would probably be my biggest ideas for adding content. In the meantime, I will want to add new minor functions and improvements like a bank and other smaller features whcih will balance gameplay. \n \nA Few Words From the Author \nBy creating Bakery Biz Tycoon, my main goal was to create a title that will relate to old school tycoon games. In which the player has to focus more on the macro of managing the enterprise than on micro-management or time management. I tried to create a more complex production than typical Time Management games, but simple enough for the time spent with Bakery Biz Tycoon to be fun. And I wish all this and I hope that my first game will give you at least a few hours of pleasant gameplay.

The game had to be completely reimplemented because the code of Anstoss 3 was considered too confused to be able to use it. This, as well as the short development time of only 12 months, meant that the program suffered from a large number of bugs that made it almost unplayable. Furthermore, the text and 3D mode was seen as too weak by the fan base and the manufacturer Ascaron was asked to make significant improvements. The manufacturer decided not to fix the program errors with patches, but rather to bring a new, revised manager onto the market based on Anstoss 4.\n\nAnstoss 4 is therefore considered to be the worst part of the Anstoss series, as it could not shine through playability, realism, or wit. Although the new database system, which now contained 145 countries, to which four leagues could be added, was praised by the manufacturer, it tended to cause very long waiting times, which massively delayed the game.\n\nAnstoss 4 differed from its predecessors not least in that the two main developers Gerald Köhler and Rolf Langenberg left the Ascaron team and switched to the competition from EA Sports to develop the soccer manager series there. Since then, the fan community has also split into two camps.\n\nAscaron was sued by its competitor Electronic Arts for license infringement shortly before the publication of Anstoss 4 and had to crush the entire CD production and change all player names.","tags":[268435470,536896404]},{"id":113251,"cover":{"id":70112,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co1i3k.jpg"},"name":"Full Kiss","platforms":[{"id":6,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}],"tags":[42,268435487,536871006],"videos":[{"id":23643,"video_id":"wtt7Ke3zUvc"}]},{"id":36246,"name":"French Indie Sale","platforms":[{"id":6,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}],"screenshots":[{"id":92294,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/h479igpdzlsmyxfbqnye.jpg"},{"id":92295,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/qltfiia4veyg4t2ifznf.jpg"},{"id":92296,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/lnnmisddaetb270i1kqe.jpg"},{"id":92297,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/cffba3wwhb2fpy9bxotr.jpg"},{"id":92298,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/hmc8tl2nywlfar4eabro.jpg"}],"summary":"Freeze time and manipulate the world with endless possibilities: build the solution YOU want where nothing is scripted and levels can be solved in multiple ways.

Every time you die and a new character is awoken by IRIS, the layout of the ship has changed. Every life will play out differently, with different enemies to face, items to find and power-ups to collect.\n\nSurvival requires you to be stealthy and VR is the perfect match for this. Sneaking around and hiding behind cover; it's second nature in VR to just lean round or peek over cover to gain the advantage Your friends can also help out by connecting to the game with their phone or tablet and hacking into the ship's computer. Once in the ship's system, players get to control doors, freeze or distract enemies, disable traps and find hidden items to scavenge for the VR player. Be aware though, sometimes the tablet player gets rewarded if you die, do you trust your friends?\"","tags":[1,18,19,21,268435487,268435488,536871251,536871489,536871859,536872032,536872879,536873643,536888038,536888039],"videos":[{"id":14471,"video_id":"x4eQzv4sQW0"},{"id":14472,"video_id":"efQ_a2fR8rU"}]}]
