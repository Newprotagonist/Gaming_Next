Whether those entities are life forms or pure machines, they react to player presence, to light and shadow and they may open access to the following.\n\nIf most parts of the journey will require only curiosity and logic, a good control and coordination on running, breathing and jumping actions will help to go through rare but exigent sequences, as an homage to old school die an retry games.\n\nThe main idea behind the game is to make the player appreciate the loneliness, the feeling to be lost in a gigantic unknown universe and to be marvelled by the beauty of this world. A world which seems to be alive, leading the player, manipulating him and playing with him for any reason.\n\nImagination is an important key to enjoy and understand NaissanceE. Walking in an undiscovered abstract structure brings questions about the nature of this world, about the meaning of this trip. Evocating and symbolic, the architecture and events will lead player’s imagination to find an answer, if it only matters.",

Punch, crawl, duck and jump across the racing rail cars to get to the DeLorean.\n\nPlay both leading roles - Doc and Marty - during this fun, pistol packin\u0027 arcade action adventure inspired by the scenes from the smash hit movie.\n\nFour part rescue chase has you racing across the plains dodging danger, and galloping through a gauntlet of enemy crossfire to save Doc\u0027s sweetheart, Clara.\n\nTake aim at the first person perspective Shooting Gallery. Practice mowing down Mad Dog, his cronies and a wild western assortment of fast moving targets.\n\nIt\u0027s tin vs. lead as you pit your supply of pie trays against Buford\u0027s gang and their six shooters.\n\nAtop the speeding hijacked train you\u0027ll have to save your own caboose while collecting speed logs. It\u0027s the trickiest obstacle course ever to ride the rails.",

    "summary": "Heavy Barrel is a 1987 overhead run and gun arcade game by Data East. \n \nTerrorists have seized the underground control complex of a nuclear missile site, and it is up to the player to infiltrate the base and kill the enemy leader. Players begin armed with a laser gun with unlimited ammunition and a limited supply of grenades. Improved weapons and grenade powerups are made available within the game, either in plain sight or within crates that must be unlocked using keys. Additionally, crates may contain orbs or one of the six pieces of the Heavy Barrel superweapon. Like SNK\u0027s Ikari Warriors, the original arcade version featured 8-way rotary joysticks. \nThe name of the game is from an in-game weapon. The Heavy Barrel is found in six pieces and is an energy cannon capable of destroying any enemy in the game with a single shot (except the final enemy, and possibly one other boss that may have required two shots). The weapon has a wide arc of fire and can be fired as fast as the player\u0027s trigger finger permits, but after thirty seconds its use is exhausted, at which point the bearer reverts to his previous weaponry. Best used to get past tough bosses, the weapon could be built several times in a single game (probably three or four times). In a two-player game, whoever collects the sixth piece is equipped with the Heavy Barrel.",

It is the first in the Cotton series of videogames. It was ported to both the Sharp X68000 and the NEC TurboGrafx-CD in 1993. The TurboGrafx-CD version was released on Super CD-ROM and features an enhanced redbook audio soundtrack and voice acting on the Japanese release. The game was later ported to Sony PlayStation under the title Cotton Original in 1999. The PlayStation release combines the enhanced digital CD-ROM soundtrack of TurboGrafx-CD release and the gameplay/graphics of the original Arcade version. A version was ported to the Neo Geo Pocket Color in 2000. Due to hardware limitations the Neo Geo Pocket Color features less detailed graphics and sound compared to previous versions, however it is still a faithful version of the original in terms of gameplay.",

He\u0027s also looking for some stickers he has misplaced, and the player is encouraged to click on everything and visit every room in the house to find all the missing items. As he uncovers animations and plays games, the player will sometimes be directed to Stanley\u0027s \"Big Book of Everything\", which he totes around in a wagon along with the items he finds. This book has a page and at least one animal for every letter of the alphabet except X - each page tells a few facts about the animal and offers a printable picture. As the player uncovers Stanley\u0027s stickers, they will appear in the book as well. Sometimes Stanley will seize upon an object the player has clicked and use it in imaginative play; for instance, finding his bear slippers makes Stanley pretend to be a bear reaching for a hive full of honey, and upon finding a cardboard tube Stanley puts it on his nose and pretends to be an anteater. These play scenes are accompanied by interesting tidbits about whatever animal he is being.",

In light tours mode, you vie with other light beams for the most points in a three-course racing tour. Watch out for obstacles, use items, and strategically use your dash ability to finish first. In freeway mode, your objective is to set a high score by traveling the greatest distance within a set amount of time. Mastering the intricacies of each setting is crucial: you’ll have to alternate between them in order to progress through the game and unlock all of its modes.\n\nWith precise controls packed in and a driving techno soundtrack, Art Style: light trax offers an experience unlike any other. Are you ready to compete in a mind-bending race at the speed of light?",

However, 15 years past, the last dragonmaster, Dyne, disappeared and the Goddess Althena ceased to appear among her children. Since that time the Goddess Tower has been silent and there have been no dragonmasters born unto the world. Now, during this seemingly rudderless time in Lunar\u0027s history, one who proclaims himself the Magic Emperor has set about to bring all of Lunar\u0027s inhabitants under his control, and only a single boy, who dreams of becoming a dragonmaster, remains to challenge him.",

    "summary": "This game was released in 2012 on Steam through Steam Greenlight while still in its beta. The developers decided to abandon its development in 2014, leaving the game in an unfinished state but available for purchase. \n \n\"The game brings a fresh new take on the city building/management genre by introducing many RPG features.  \n   \nIn Towns you manage a settlement on top of an active dungeon. Instead of playing the hero who delves deep into the dungeon, how about playing the town that houses and caters to the hero\u0027s needs?  \n  \nBoth the RPG and strategic aspects will be fleshed out over a series of sprawling dungeons.  \n  \nAttract travelling heroes that will independently explore the dungeons below, fight off monsters, gain levels, special skills and collect the best loot they can find in order to clear the land of all evil!  \n  \nCraft unique weapons, trade with exotic items, obtain randomized loot, set up devious death traps and build a settlement capable of holding back the forces that come up from the depths!\"",

Everyone told us we would fail, but I... \n \nWe... didn\u0027t give up. None of us. \n \nWe lived on Amanoshima, an island far to the south of mainland Japan and the location of a large aerospace program. Our school, Amanoshima Academy, had a prestigious aerospace curriculum and students from all over the nation attended it, eyes set on being a part of the next generation of rocket scientists. \n \n\"Hey. Want to make rockets with us?\" \n \nThat was why I was so surprised when asked me to join her. I was enrolled in the normal curriculum, not aerospace, and nobody ever doubted the fact that I was an idiot. But when I looked into her eyes, I saw how sincere she was... and it shook me. \n \nFinally, I decided to join the small rocket club she was the president of: Byakko. \n \n\"You won\u0027t make rockets at Byakko.\" \n \nThe one who told me that was Reimei Kaho, vice-president of the largest and most illustrious rocket club of the many at our school: the ARC. She had come to notify us that we had been dissolved. \n \nThere was only one way to stave off our own abolition. We had to win a rocket competition before the beginning of the second term. There were five of us. Arisa. Me. \n \n\"We can make rockets at Byakko too.\" \n \nIbuki Nazuna, who loved rockets like nobody else. \n \n\"I want to be in your club.\" \n \nMichibiki Honoka, my childhood friend who loved to play tricks on others. \n \nAnd, finally, Kaho, who had made so much trouble for us initially. Together we tackled rocket science. \n \nWe had to win a competition if we wanted our club to endure. And, even more than that, we wanted to launch a rocket that our own hands had built and see it soar toward space. \n \nThe Karman line: 100km of altitude. \n \nHigher than the clear sky. \n \nWe worked hard and chased our dreams to the edge of space.",

Nazi scientists have failed to successfully shut down and contain experimental labs. Experiments have broken from constraint and are now wreaking havoc upon the wasteland. Due to high threat levels, outside support cannot manage to intervene without direct notice, it\u0027s up to straggling survivors to take survival into their own hands and unravel the mystery of biological and supernatural haunting\u0027s. \n \nSurvival is our co-operative open world experience in development that offers both offline single-player and a host-sessioned online multiplayer experience that allows for up to three friends (or random players) to collectivize and work together to scavenge, loot, support the growth of their outpost and fight to protect its walls in the aftermath together. This living world will give the player endless reasons to explore and interact with such as ongoing open world events ranging from hordes, rescues, and bosses. Players will be able to progress their survivor by leveling a tree of skills and beneficial traits. Survival is where the player will have to put their true strategy to the test by building the ultimate outpost and load-out to take on the aftermath. You build your story. \n \nLike survival, all environmental threats and events are still creeping around every corner, however, the player will be able to approach Quarantine solo or accompany up to three other players as a team against other teams bringing their survival strategies into play. All players start off with minimal firepower and are to work their way up the power scale by scavenging or crafting equipment and weapons with materials found throughout the aftermath. Double your resources by looting your player victims to increase your chances of success in your next battle. Players will be able to build their outposts with a few limitations as well as advance its upgrades for all around defense against player attacks. Quarantine brings a nerve wracking experience as players can lose all of their progress in a blink of an eye. Teams that are fully eliminated are removed from the match entirely. Players who are downed may crawl to safety and be picked up freely by allies. However, if eliminated, your team will need a revival syringe to bring you back into the fight which can be found in rare loot drops and/or crafted from a lengthy recipe of uncommon materials. The last team standing will be notified and rewarded and given an option to opt out of their current match. Winning teams may stay in their current match if desired and continue their battle against the environment itself.",

A countdown before the ball is launched awards you with some bonus points if you time it correctly, and the love it or hate it theme tune returns to drive the action.

Easy, which uses four direction arrows; Medium and Expert both use eight direction arrows. In addition to the standard dance contest, the game has a workout mode which, when given the player\u0027s weight, calculates the projected calories burned during a dance. There\u0027s also a \u0027recorder\u0027 mode where the player can create their own dance routines.\n\nThe basic game is for a single player, but with two dance mats connected the game supports a multiplayer mode for up to eight players.",

During what may be her final hours, Beth wanders through important moments in her life while also staying a few steps ahead of the monster who won’t rest until she is no more.\n\nMazes in dreams are said to symbolize the dreamer’s feeling of “being trapped.” As Beth tries to find meaning and strength in her life, players must guide her through a variety of mazes, each with its own twist. The most challenging sections are reserved for confrontations with the monster, who must be outmaneuvered and outwitted to proceed.",

First announced as Conker\u0027s Quest at E3 1997, the game would have followed the all ages environment of Conker\u0027s Pocket Tales, a handheld title released during its prolonged development cycle.\n\nBefore the game could be finished, Rare had already made similar games that had already achieved general acclaim, most notably Banjo-Kazooie and Diddy Kong Racing. The developers began to receive criticism for creating another innocent platformer starring cute and friendly animals. In 1999, Rareware revealed that they were going to entirely redesign the game to appeal to an older audience.\n\nWhile it was first believed to be an April Fool\u0027s joke, the game went unreleased and replaced with Conker\u0027s Bad Fur Day in 2001.",

    "summary": "You and four allies join arms in battle as you fight for glory on the battlefield against enemy heroes on a traditional 3 lane map featuring an interactive jungle, epic monsters and more! \n \nIn a match 10 players are divided into two teams with each player controlling their chosen hero. No two heroes are the same. Each hero has their own unique abilities and design, meaning there’s a hero to match everyone’s style of play. Heroes complete objectives to collect gold like killing minions, towers or enemy heroes. As a hero collects more gold they can buy items from the shop that influence their heroes in interesting ways - allowing them to teleport to new locations, go invisible, freeze time and more. Items also allow a hero to get more powerful by giving their hero better attributes such as power, attack speed, health and various other stats. \n \nUnlike most MOBAs, Predecessor puts you into the heart of the action. The Third-Person perspective fully immerses you into the game as enemies appear from shadow walls, over ledges or from behind you.",

    "summary": "Valkyria Chronicles 2 is a sequel to the critically acclaimed tactical RPG Valkyria Chronicles on the PS3, which was released exclusively on the PSP (PlayStation Portable) system. The game takes place two years after the conclusion of the original game and takes you back to the epic adventure set in 1930’s fictitious Europe. In this sequel, you play as a group of young Gallian Military Academy cadets who find themselves plunged into a bitter civil war when the newly formed Gallian Revolutionary Army stages a coup. As the drama and battle unfold, you will experience stories of friendship, love and growing pains during a time of war and revolution.\n\nThe \u0027CANVAS\u0027 engine originally developed by SEGA Game Studios Japan for Valkyria Chronicles has been fully redesigned for the PSP system. This incredibly distinctive engine will power over 20 new distinct and visually stunning environments where you will have over 200 different missions to explore. For the first time ad-hoc Versus and Co-op multiplayer gameplay will now be available. The \u0027BLiTZ\u0027 battle system has also been re-designed to offer players the freedom to strategically move around the environment and attack enemies using real-time controls, something never before seen in the tactical role-playing game genre.\n\nThis game adds some new unit classes and the ability to upgrade or change classes. It also changes the battle system to include multiple map areas that are unlocked as you take over enemy bases revealing more of the battlefield and allowing you to call units into that area.",

The full power of the PlayStation 2 is on show in 60-frames-per-second motion with motion-captured players animated down to their hair and shadows, all shown in action with nearly 50 different camera positions for soccer action right out of broadcast TV. 18 International teams and 32 American squads line up and shoot hard with bicycle kicks, fakes, and headers. Soccer America features a balanced Easy Play mode to let beginners get into the game, while pro fielders will find the sharp AI more responsive to your fancy moves on the turf than the average soccer sim. With a Multi-Tap (for PlayStation 2), up to four players can call their formations and drive to the net, so limber up and spit out your orange rind--soccer action is calling.",

What an idyll ... and what a blow to the ego of mice! It is time for the next operation against the purring mistake of nature. The game was created after an episode of the animated series. In it you will have to build some clever \"Incredible Machine\" type of constructions, as a result of which must occur the imminent meeting of pans with the mustached Leopold. The game is very demanding on your ingenuity and resourcefulness. You can choose from the pair of mice which you want to use as each has a different character and different skills. Leopold, however, our hero cop is ready to tear up the blueprints into a few parts that need to be found again and glued. All operations are logical in nature, so that probably the white mouse who is weaker can not lift a stone, instead the dark mouse can do it. You can find a Tamagotchi like electronic toy also that can grow little kittens into cats.",
