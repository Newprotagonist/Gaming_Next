The player controls Octodad, a dapper octopus masquerading as a human, as he goes about a day of his life. His existence is a constant struggle, as he must master mundane tasks with his unwieldy boneless tentacles while simultaneously keeping his cephalopodan nature a secret from his human family.\n\nThe game features a humorous plot revolving around the central character, an octopus who is undercover as an average human with a family. The plot revolves around the player, controlling Octodad, attempting to complete various household chores and tasks while maintaining his secret. The gameplay takes advantage of the setting of an octopus' acting of a human to present an idea of mundane tasks being much more out of control, with a key mechanic being the suspicion towards Octodad from various family members. Its sequel Dadliest Catch was released on January 30, 2014, and was one of the first titles to be given the Steam Greenlight.\n\nOctodad is a freeware independent video game developed by a group of students at DePaul University, many of whom would go on to form Young Horses, Inc., the developers of its sequel Octodad: Dadliest Catch. The game was developed for the Student Showcase of the 2011 Independent Games Festival, and would go on to be one of 8 winners in the Student Showcase award of that year.","tags":[1,27,268435464,268435465,268435469,268435487,268435488,536870979,536871029,536871199,536871262,536871939,536872060,536872287,536872961,536872981,536873096,536873787,536874395,536875088,536875229,536875231,536875236,536875275,536875330,536875340,536875433,536875466,536875492,536875501,536875537,536875682,536875872,536876182,536876290,536876563,536876615,536876833,536877327,536878517,536878573,536878596,536880405],"videos":[{"id":3097,"video_id":"lVoSYDWX2Ig"}]},{"id":138534,"cover":{"id":131038,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co2t3y.jpg"},"name":"RoboPhobik","platforms":[{"id":6,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"},{"id":49,"name":"Xbox One"},{"id":130,"name":"Nintendo Switch"}],"screenshots":[{"id":403352,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc8n88.jpg"},{"id":403353,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc8n89.jpg"},{"id":403354,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc8n8a.jpg"},{"id":403355,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc8n8b.jpg"},{"id":403356,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc8n8c.jpg"},{"id":403357,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc8n8d.jpg"},{"id":403358,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc8n8e.jpg"},{"id":403359,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc8n8f.jpg"},{"id":403360,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc8n8g.jpg"},{"id":403361,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc8n8h.jpg"}],"summary":"A 70s sci-fi inspired top-down arcade shooter that has a unique twist: enemies won't move or attack if you'll stand still.

The case was found in Data East's favor however, as the court found that the copied elements were scenes a faire, elements necessary for depicting the scenario. The game was later ported to the Super Nintendo Entertainment System in 1994, and followed by a sequel Karnov's Revenge for Neo Geo.\n\nThere are three different gameplay modes are available. CPU Battle is the traditional arcade mode, where the player select a character and try to complete the game by beating all of the other fighters. In survival mode, the player select a team of five characters to go up against another team.

One to eight human players can play, controlling different leaders and factions. Gameplay is done in one of two scenarios; the beginning of the civil war in 1555 or Nobunaga surrounded by his enemies in 1571.

Players just connect to a virtual world where they have to prove their skills while advancing through all the 100 levels (Beginner, Rookie, Super Rookie, Semi Pro, Pro, S1, S2, S3, S4 - Master), based on the amount of experience points they have gathered after each game played. The player can create up to three characters of either gender. Before players can start a game, the character must have equipped at least one weapon and one skill. Players can choose between close-range, mid-range, long-range (sniping), mental, throwing, and support weapons. Players can also choose between active or passive Skills.\n\nCostumes, items, weapons and skills can be bought from the game shop with PEN or AP. PEN is virtual money, earned by playing matches, while AP is earned by paying real money (multiple methods, from credit cards to mobile text messages, specific to each country). Costumes, items, weapons and skills can be permanent or rented (hour-based or day-based). Permanent stuff needs repairs after each use, rented stuff doesn't. Day-based items follow the real life time, while hour-based items count only when playing.\n\nAfter players create and equip their characters with items purchased from the shop, they are ready to join a server based on country/language, and then join a room based on Game Mode. A room can have maximum 12 players connected: 6 players in Alpha Team and 6 players in Beta Team.\n\nThere are various modes in the game:\nIn Touchdown Mode , the most played game mode, players must take a yellow, bouncing ball called \"fumbi\", run with it to the other side of the map and put it in the red goalpost. Fumbi can be carried by multiple teammates along the way.\n\nIn Deathmatch Mode, players must kill each other in order to take their team to victory before the time ends.\n\nIn Chaser, a virus takes control over a player who gets overpowered and who must kill the other players in the time left.\n\nIn Captain Mode, all players have crowns over their heads which gives them a large amount of hit points. Each team must eliminate all the enemies with crowns in order to win or at least have more teammates with crowns alive when the time runs out.\n\nIn Battle Royal, players must kill each other (no teams here). The player with the highest score is marked as a target (targets change all the time in a BR match).\n\nIn Arcade Mode, players follow a story of the game where they must kill the virtual bots and finish all the given missions, structured in chapters.\n\nPlayers can also join Clans and play Clan Matches.","tags":[1,18,268435461,536870990,536871139,536871208,536871213,536871882,536871904,536871937,536872152,536872245,536873067,536873297,536874900,536874947,536875095,536875217,536875356,536875437,536875455,536875570,536875895,536876034,536876262,536876365,536876500,536876503,536876832,536876899,536877162,536877264,536877319,536877501,536879053],"videos":[{"id":30248,"video_id":"X8nja0-uoEE"}]},{"id":148170,"cover":{"id":203871,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co4db3.jpg"},"name":"Skittles","platforms":[{"id":130,"name":"Nintendo Switch"}],"screenshots":[{"id":451064,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc9o1k.jpg"},{"id":451066,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc9o1m.jpg"},{"id":451068,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc9o1o.jpg"},{"id":451069,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc9o1p.jpg"}],"summary":"Skittles is a game of skill in which the goal is to score exactly fifty points by knocking down pins numbered 1 through 12 with a throw of a wooden stick. This Skittle game can be played solo against the computer or in local multiplayer. The player throws a stick into the pins. The player's score depends on the number of pins knocked down: If he knocks down a pin, he scores the value of the pin; If he knocks down several pins, he scores the number of pins knocked down (if all the pins knock down, the player scores twelve points); If a pin is not completely down on the ground and is balanced on another pin or on the the throwing stick, it is not counted. Fallen pins are then raised on their feet, numbered facing the throwing area, right where they are and without lifting them off the ground. Thus the configuration of the playing area changes. Each player takes a turn at throwing and as many turns are taken as necessary. The winner is the one who scores exactly 50 points. If this mark is exceeded, the player or team score drops to 25. So as the 50 points are approached, the player must be careful to knock down only the pin(s) that will cause the player to reach the 50 points by value (if only one pin falls) or number (if more than one pin falls). For example, if his score is 48, the player must knock down any two pins…","tags":[268435470,268435489]},{"id":187163,"cover":{"id":203120,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co4cq8.jpg"},"name":"Em","platforms":[{"id":6,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}],"screenshots":[{"id":710579,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scf8ab.jpg"},{"id":710580,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scf8ac.jpg"},{"id":710581,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scf8ad.jpg"},{"id":710582,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scf8ae.jpg"},{"id":710583,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scf8af.jpg"}],"summary":"EM is a fast-paced, hard hitting 3D fighter featuring Electro-Magnetic combat.

Movement has the player travel through the city using the D-pad and a map located on the bottom of the screen with the objective being to destroy certain objectives such as enemy humans and buildings as well as pick up power-ups. There is an animation in the screen above the map that shows the results of their movements and attacks.\n\nBattle mode kicks in when the player locates an enemy on the map, like Biollante or Mechagodzilla, and is taken to a side-scrolling cinematic-style battle where the player must use punches, tail whips and the famous fire breath to drain the energy of the opposing monster. However, the Fighting Spirit system is present which is in a sense a morality meter where the player must pick the right attacks at the right time in order to connect certain attacks. Choosing the wrong attacks or failing to connect with them will cause the meter to drop and make Godzilla more vulnerable to attack.","tags":[1,18,268435460,268435471,536870979,536871019,536871079,536871213,536871644,536871882,536871972,536872211,536872257,536873874,536874694,536874743,536874745,536875054,536875056,536875197,536875539,536875717,536875755,536875944,536877048,536881427],"videos":[{"id":36167,"video_id":"eliW2ot-3_M"}]},{"id":178809,"cover":{"id":198573,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co497x.jpg"},"name":"Popeye","platforms":[{"id":48,"name":"PlayStation 4"},{"id":130,"name":"Nintendo Switch"}],"screenshots":[{"id":674393,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scegd5.jpg"},{"id":674395,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scegd7.jpg"},{"id":674397,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scegd9.jpg"},{"id":674402,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scegde.jpg"},{"id":674403,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scegdf.jpg"}],"summary":"The official Popeye game in which you play the spinach eating sailor in this modernized adaptation of the classic arcade game.

The game was made to celebrate the tenth anniversary of the series. The game features a character-switching feature, similar to the spin-off, Samurai Warriors: Chronicles, with which players can take two characters into battles simultaneously, and freely switch between the two. Two new moves, \"Hyper Attacks\" and \"Rage Mode\" are featured in this game: Hyper Attacks is a secondary moveset available to all characters that allows the player to sweep through and clear out crowd of enemies with a dashing animation, although it is useless against enemy officers, as they will either deflect it or are otherwise immune against it. Rage Mode renders the player invincible for a period of time, and also enhances the player's attacks as well as empowering their Muso attack by using the Spirit Gauge. Duels are featured, which occur when player-controlled characters meet with enemy officers under specific conditions.","tags":[1,17,22,268435481,536871076,536871165,536871529,536872443,536872444,536872983,536874093,536875067,536876227,536876240,536876486,536877301,536879800,536888127,536888348,536889634,536890157,536890458,536890686,536890687],"videos":[{"id":2570,"video_id":"pQyoQj0eoZo"},{"id":2571,"video_id":"QDPoaDjT2DM"}]},{"id":55705,"cover":{"id":192997,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co44x1.jpg"},"name":"Trianga's Project: Battle Splash 2.0","platforms":[{"id":6,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}],"screenshots":[{"id":122063,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/zod8gfbfv8pnckzgmvm7.jpg"},{"id":122064,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/eb5v4zw3tof6wkzts8of.jpg"},{"id":122065,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/ndfgaina7bnijoyrm2n9.jpg"},{"id":122066,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/aslvyr8lm2ailrlhtv3u.jpg"},{"id":122067,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/e2logkcgnzv9srlmnge3.jpg"}],"summary":"Trianga's Project: Battle Splash 2.0 is a Friendly, Competitive, Team-based Third-Person Shooter inspired from Fast Paced Arena Shooter and modern Class Based Shooter.

Similar to games like Earthbound, enemy encounters are seen as actual enemies that players can avoid or attempt to strike early. The actual battles are a combination of turn-based menu attacks, and timed reactions to enemies during battle. By watching the way an enemy reacts, you can anticipate their attack and avoid it or counterattack.","tags":[27,268435464,268435468,536870928,536870984,536870992,536871186,536871208,536871262,536871327,536871470,536871776,536871878,536871931,536871938,536872098,536872201,536872211,536872293,536872307,536872587,536872594,536872961,536872983,536873023,536873024,536873064,536873186,536873236,536873249,536873293,536873328,536874098,536874209,536874398,536875050,536875058,536875059,536875073,536875074,536875096,536875125,536875130,536875131,536875151,536875196,536875209,536875213,536875214,536875239,536875245,536875262,536875264,536875265,536875275,536875286,536875388,536875390,536875391,536875392,536875394,536875396,536875440,536875455,536875494,536875517,536875524,536875550,536875609,536875621,536875639,536875654,536875705,536875712,536875739,536875761,536875776,536875852,536875855,536875900,536875910,536875912,536875924,536875934,536876013,536876030,536876031,536876083,536876095,536876122,536876205,536876220,536876270,536876271,536876361,536876377,536876413,536876446,536876450,536876471,536876490,536876501,536876505,536876511,536876546,536876553,536876677,536876715,536876722,536876879,536876891,536876952,536877014,536877048,536877051,536877052,536877053,536877055,536877065,536877066,536877069,536877070,536877071,536877072,536877079,536877084,536877085,536877088,536877090,536877091,536877096,536877104,536877105,536877106,536877116,536877135,536877434,536877570,536877582,536877584,536877710,536877726,536877759,536877833,536877849,536877864,536877991,536878014,536878019,536878067,536878150,536878154,536878155,536878158,536878311,536878335,536878408,536878417,536878597,536878601,536878606,536879098,536879099,536879791,536880044,536880101,536880127,536880626,536880847,536880848,536880889,536880958,536880968,536880991,536881352,536882449,536882497,536882724,536883122,536883142,536883154,536883865,536883980,536883994,536884737,536884738,536884739,536884740,536884741,536884742]},{"id":35863,"cover":{"id":184791,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co3yl3.jpg"},"name":"Rktcr","platforms":[{"id":3,"name":"Linux"},{"id":6,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"},{"id":14,"name":"Mac"}],"screenshots":[{"id":88823,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/xk30hn4v8oqcwxmd0wsx.jpg"},{"id":88824,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/vcppfopqfon10xenyygo.jpg"},{"id":88825,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/kssfrfykunv74ltxgysp.jpg"},{"id":88826,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/ininecwwbe4mjwhyhgg7.jpg"},{"id":88827,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/olqfnuihon6rjywvdc88.jpg"}],"summary":"Rktcr is tool-assisted-speed-run: the game.\nIt both requires and enables you to play perfectly.\nIt is a very difficult game.","tags":[268435466,268435487,268435488]},{"id":187803,"cover":{"id":205025,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co4e75.jpg"},"name":"Peep the Trayton","platforms":[{"id":6,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}],"screenshots":[{"id":714396,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scfb8c.jpg"}],"summary":"Peep the Trayton is an Indie Horror game that will knock your socks off with state of the art AI pathing.

The dolphin starts off as an overworked aquarium star, forced to jump through flaming hoops for food. He escapes from captivity by eating his way through the aquarium and taking revenge on his trainer. The shark is the final playable character, an artificial fish created by scientists to save Earth's oceans. It uses self-replicating nano technology to consume everything in its path and convert their matter into its own. There's no telling how big this shark will get.\nThere are over 50 levels in the main story mode of the game. There are also 15 more challenging bonus levels to play after the main game has been completed.\nThere are three main environments to explore in the game: temperate, tropical, and arctic.\nThere are a wide range of difficulty levels to choose from. On the easiest difficulty enemies do virtually no damage. On the most challenging difficulty enemies will eat you and cause instant level failure.\nTwo players can play side by side on the same computer.

Additionally, this version can be played solo, whereas the board game requires at least three people.\n\nThe basic objective of Pictionary is for a person on a team to try and illustrate a word he or she has been given using only drawings. The team must guess what is being illustrated within a certain amount of time. As a reward for guessing the puzzle correctly, the team gets to advance on a board. The team that makes it to the end of the board first wins.\n\nIn addition to the classic drawing aspect to the game, there are also four mini-games to be played in order for a team to win.

For as long as possible, at least.\n\nIn this action/strategy game, you will have to survive in the studio amidst a variety of randomized circumstances: random supporting party members (chosen from eight Rooster Teeth cast members in the game, each with their own unique VO), random weapons, random zombien waves, random crafting materials, and more. You never know what you're going to get when you set foot in the studio, but you're going to have to make the best of what you're given.\n\nTo survive, you're going to have to get weapons from Weapon Dispensers, build traps, construct defenses, and stay on the move so the Zombiens don't corner you and devour your innards.","tags":[1,268435471,536870915,536870917],"videos":[{"id":4512,"video_id":"n47d_d_bH4M"}]},{"id":174537,"cover":{"id":185772,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co3zcc.jpg"},"name":"Wargame: Red Dragon - Nation Pack: South Africa","platforms":[{"id":6,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}],"screenshots":[{"id":654480,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sce100.jpg"},{"id":654481,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sce101.jpg"},{"id":654482,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sce102.jpg"},{"id":654483,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sce103.jpg"},{"id":654484,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sce104.jpg"},{"id":654485,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sce105.jpg"},{"id":654486,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sce106.jpg"}],"summary":"Get back into the fight with South Africa's unique Cold War arsenal.
