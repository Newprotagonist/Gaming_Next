Kuma Story was originally created as an anniversary gift from SpacePirateCaine to his girlfriend for their 3-year anniversary. She enjoyed it very much, and asked that it be continued, and shared with the rest of the world. Please note that what little text there is in the game is generally in Japanese.

Originally commercial and subscription-driven, Shadowbane was launched in March 2003. It closed on July 1, 2009.\n\nThe regular game took place in a dark fantasy world called Aerynth (the world will sometimes depend on the servers, many of which have unique world maps). Gameplay features many aspects typical of role-playing video games, such as experience points, character classes, and fantasy races. Character creation was fairly extensive, allowing for detailed, differentiable characters to be created.\n\n-Wikipedia",

Each ghost is a victim, his or her mysterious demise never fully investigated. These lost souls are cursed to ride the train until someone has the courage to go back in time and reveal the truth about their deaths.\n\nDo you dare to break the curse? Will you uncover the mysteries and free the souls? Do you have what it takes to face and defeat the terrible masked Engineer and if you do, what price will you have to pay?

As the power-hungry mages split into the rivaling Council of Light and the League of Darkness, a war broke out, lasting many generations. Chaos was brought unto the land as the Talisman was stolen. Retrieve it from the clutches of evil to restore order.\n\nLegend of the Silver Talisman is an action game (with light RPG mechanics) inspired by coin-operated machine hit Gauntlet, with visuals similar to Ultima 6. Two players (the other character goes under computer control in single player mode) compete over items and power-ups to be found in enemy infested dungeon mazes: swords, wands, shields, helmets, armor, scrolls and potions. Combat is done by simply running into the creature/player.\n\nThe first episode (out of 3) was released as shareware. From 2003 the full game is available as freeware.",

It is the one thing that will heal the heart of a king and breathe life into a dying land. More than all these things, it is a symbol of the trials of body, mind and spirit that all people face in their search for meaning and truth. Come with us to Camelot as the legendary King Arthur sets out on his ultimate quest.\n\nAs King Arthur, the weight of the world rests on your shoulders as you contemplate the task that lies ahead.\n\nIn pagan times, the legends of Camelot were told as epic tales full of fearsome battles and tests of faith. Bold, colorful, and often brutal, these tales survived the ages. They were a tribute to the legendary High King of Britain who managed to bring the warring tribes of Saxons, Celts, Angles and Jutes under one rule and bring about a rebirth of Western civilization.\n\nSadly, in the last half century, the Arthur legend has been recast as a cartoon and children\u0027s story. The mystic rituals and dark passions that colored the original Arthurian legends have been watered down to the soft and toothless fairy tales most commonly seen today.\n\nWith Conquest of Camelot, designer Christy Marx has dug deep into the most ancient roots of legend to restore the power and passion of King Arthur and his court: his queen\u0027s forbidden love for Sir Lancelot; the struggle for supremacy between Christianity and the ancient Roman warrior-god, Mithra. The blending of myth, history and religion behind the Grail legend is dealt with honestly and directly.\n\nThis combination of pre-Medieval history and ancient legend makes for a more sophisticated, complex and powerful view of Arthur than any you may have seen before.\n\nConquests of Camelot designer Christy Marx is best known for writing the \"Jem\" animated TV series, and the \"Sisterhood of Steel\" comics and graphic novel. With her husband and professional partner, illustrator Peter Ledger, she has researched Arthurian myths and legends extensively for many years in preparation for writing this game.",

The idea is to use these events to craft the game’s mythology. The game doesn\u0027t use regular exposition to tell it\u0027s story, rather, the player will absorb the nuances of Bravery’s narrative by exploring its gorgeous environment, experiencing the aesthetics of its mechanics or by simply making sense of the vast array of mysterious random events.\n\nAlso, the game gets rid of all the grinding: Skinner Box mechanics and \u0027\u0027artificial\u0027\u0027 stats-based progression have no place here: I\u0027m talking about a game with absolutely no numbers and very, very few written words.\n\nNo Place for Bravery is an extremely hard and completely skill and strategy based game. The world is to be relentless, and the player feels the mediocrity before such a world in each step that is taken.\"",

The character is walking on a tiny map sized in 1/5 of the screen, and when he comes inside new room, the description is written. There are numerous riddles and puzzles to solve along the way, as well as many people to meet and places to explore. It is very important that you talk to everyone you encounter, search all rooms of the castle you enter, and make note of what you learn for later reference.\n\nThe Inspector (of Fighter/Mage class) has a number of personal attributes, common for RPGs, which affect the play of the game. Spells must be learned from special books. The higher a character\u0027s level, the more powerful the spell he can learn.",

Planning phases include briefing, intelligence, kit select, and map screens, while actual gameplay takes place from a first-person perspective.\n\nWeapons can be set to fully automatic (continuous), burst (three shots), or semi-automatic (one shot). Crosshair and auto-locking features provide concise control when aiming, though grenades can be used in situations requiring less precise targeting. The mission objectives, a health meter, mini-map, the currently selected weapon, and ammo status are displayed on-screen at all times. Other features in Tom Clancy\u0027s Rainbow Six: Lone Wolf include a choice of insertion points for each mission (with different advantages), night vision goggles, and an option to save after successfully completing each mission.",

Not only that, the game boldly travels to 15 locations around the globe, including New York, Africa, and Japan. Between each level of play, you\u0027ll see an awesome animated sequence that advances the storyline to its next phase. Based on what you see in the clips, you\u0027ll have to accomplish certain missions in order to advance to the next stage. Though pinball has been around since the early part of the century, it\u0027s never been so vast or explosive. The game\u0027s makers even worked in such characters as Zeo Zords, King Mondo, and Queen Madrina, just to make things interesting.

Find the perfect combination of four pieces of equipment in each combat situation in order to pull through to the end. \n \nCore Features \n - Manage a large inventory of items, each which performs a different action in combat. \n - 16 unique pieces of equipment, from the claymore to the crossbow to even the flag staff and more! \n - Turn the tide with the Judgement system which builds from taking damage, allowing the use of special equipment actions. \n - Be wary that monsters can counter your Judgement with a similar meter called Revenge. \n - Slowly uncover Gwenaelle\u0027s motivation and purpose as she converses with her horse, Prixton, between fights. \n - Reach the true ending with perfect equipment execution and preservation. \n - ...Or relax in comfy mode if it all becomes too overwhelming (*￣▽￣)b \n \nPreserve and prevail!",

Other bonus items are located around the levels, while yet more can be found by using your club creatively and adventurously. There are bosses and passwrods after every few levels.",

The game retains the three-plane \"oversway\" system from Fatal Fury 3, which features a main lane for fighting, with foreground and background planes used to avoid attacks or leap towards the opponent. A dedicated button is now used to make an \"oversway\" (or change plane) towards the background or foreground.\n\nReal Bout introduces a Power Gauge, which fills up as the player performs normal or special techniques against their opponent or defend themselves, similar to many super move gauges featured in other fighting games. The Power Gauge allows players to perform one of three types of Special Techniques, depending of the level of the Power Gauge.\n\nReal Bout also introduces stages with ring-outs, a gameplay feature previously introduced in 3D fighting games such as Virtua Fighter. If the player performs certain attacks on their opponent while next to the boundaries, the character will eventually destroy the barrier keeping the opponent in the ring and be able to knock them out of the stage for an easy win.",

As in most games of the series there are also loads of mini-games and unique gameplay sequences such as maneuvering Goemon\u0027s giant mecha.\n\nThe game continues the tradition of bizarre humor unique to the series, you can play as either Goemon or any of his 3 companions, Ebisumaru, Sasuke or Yae with each sporting unique weapons and abilities and also with their own dialogue options and cutscenes, which feature sitcom-like pre-recorded laughs for added wackiness.",

But no matter what the story is one thing always stays the same: The hunt for the king. \n \nEven though the rules aren\u0027t complicated the game offers fascinating strategies and rewards tactical play. Try to surround the enemy pieces, plan ahead, lay traps and force your opponent into surrender. Will you capture the king for gold and glory? Can the loyal guards hold back the invading forces and secure the flight of their king? \n \nYou can even create your own custom variants -- with over 200,000 different variants possible -- for online or offline play!",

    "summary": "Primal tells the story of Jennifer Tate, a 21-year-old woman searching for her boyfriend through a series of demonic realms. As the story develops, more is revealed about Jen\u0027s past and her relationship with her boyfriend, as well as the nature of the demon worlds.\n\nIn Primal, the player can control either Jen or Scree as they navigate the realms of Oblivion. As the game progresses, newer demonic forms are obtained, which prove invaluable in solving various puzzles and combat.\n\nControl can be switched between Jen and Scree at any time in game. When in control of one, the other will be operated by AI, performing various functions depending on the situation. During play, the characters can interact with one another, performing actions such as asking questions, or siphoning energy.\n\nWhen in control of Jen, the player may transform into one of four demonic forms for various purposes, depending on the situation (provided the forms are unlocked). When in a demon form, Jen experiences a boost in attack, defense, speed, attack range and access to abilities unavailable in a human form. The tattoo on Jen\u0027s back also glows when in a demon form, corresponding to various forms.\n\nDefeating enemies involves weakening enemies to the point where their hit points reach zero, at which time a finishing move must be performed to kill the enemy. While the moves differ in style and time taken, the final effect remains the same. Enemies can be finished off before the health bar reaches zero, and doing so leaves more residual energy.\n\nWhile Jen can remain in a demonic form indefinitely, taking damage will reduce health. However, hit points here are represented by demonic energy. When an enemy is killed, the remaining energy can be drained through use of Scree, who can store the energy for when it is needed. Jen can then call on the energy, siphoning it off to replenish her own. Scree can store a vast amount of energy, but also has limits as to how much.\n\nWhen in control of Scree, the player is invulnerable; Scree, being a gargoyle, cannot suffer damage, making him an effective scout. Scree is capable of climbing on stone walls, a necessary ability when traversing the realms. Scree can also store drained energy from dead enemies, which can be used to replenish Jen\u0027s demonic health, though he must remain immobile when doing so.\n\nScree is revealed to be the long-lost Abdizur, who disappeared following an encounter with the lord of Chaos. In Solus, for a temporary amount of time, the player possesses a life-size statue of Abdizur via Scree, to combat Belhazur when Jen\u0027s powers are not fit to do so. The player may also possess other statues in an area under given circumstances.\n\nThe player may also happen across various energy crystals, which can be stored and used if Scree\u0027s energy reserves are not enough and the player is at low health. These crystals are kept throughout the game, the only exclusion being when revisiting previous scenes, at which point they are reduced to a default amount. This means that the crystals function as extra lives, to a degree.\n\nIf Jen is in human form, her health replenishes automatically if she is not in battle (human form only; demon energy must be replenished by either drawing on Scree\u0027s reserve energy or, failing that, by using a crystal). While in human form, Jen\u0027s health represents her presence in the demon world. If she loses all her health while in human form, she is returned to the human world, where she is in a near-death state. When this happens, the player must direct Scree to the nearest rift gate within a time limit (not seen on screen, though the voice of Arella warns the player that time is running out). If Scree does not reach a rift gate in time, Jen dies, and the game is over.\n\nThroughout the game, constant saving can prove onerous, particularly if the player wishes to backtrack and revisit certain areas. Provided a save game is present, the player may do so, and can revisit nearly all of the locations, once they have been unlocked via an in-game cutscene.",

When that happens, they will pop. Each character has their own favorite bubble color and when they pop them, color energy is transferred to their special jar. Once the jar is full, the player can unleash their super special attack. During the puzzles, the player is also provided with nine different special attacks that they can obtain by getting special bubbles. The current special attack the player has is displayed on a wheel called the Torus.\n\nThe game consists of 3 different 1 player difficulty modes along with a training mode, each having 50 levels of bubble popping puzzles and a 2 player mode that allows a player to compete for the higher score against a friend. Each level is allowed to be won by popping all of the bubbles or by collecting a certain amount of Level Stars.",

It was developed by Yuke\u0027s Future Media Creators and published by Titus Software in 1999. The player can choose from ten characters to fight in several game modes including story mode, arcade mode, versus mode, practice and survival mode.\n\nThe story mode is a unique aspect to the game and sets it apart from other fighting games. Each character has a unique story mode which progresses like an ongoing television program, complete with episode names and previews with voice acting. As the mode progresses, you learn more about the character\u0027s backstory and why they are fighting, an incentive to play through the game with each character. Evil Zone is also one of the few games to feature a fully fleshed out story mode for its boss character.",

He needs to find a telephone to call the breakdown service and get the spaceship fixed. Shufflepuck Café is the nearest place for miles, so he goes in to use their telephone. The main eight Shufflepuck players are standing in his way and will not let him get to the phone until he has beaten them all.

With the typical Ankh humour, numerous bizarre characters and gags by the wagonload, Ankh - Battle Of The Gods is again a candidate for the adventure gaming throne.\nBattle Of The Gods feature several new locations, including Luxor, the gambling capital of ancient Egypt. And an unexpected trip takes Assil to a far-away, exotic location, where he will have to deal with the entirely unfamiliar conventions of its native people. The new Ankh features even more detailed character models and smoother animations.",

The game contains all of the elements of the other Ultimas, as well as some extra features that add to the experience. You are able to interact with the environment in a realistic manner... picking branches from trees, digging clay from a riverbank etc. Savage Empire also has a lot more character interaction than the previous Ultimas. Characters will jump into conversations whenever they feel they have something pertinent to add."

The player must defeat seven corrupt ruling heroes in order to reconquer the lands and establish his lordship over its inhabitants. The game features a corruption feature, similar to that of the Fable games, but allowing the player to \"be evil... or really evil\", where certain actions and choices affect different aspects of the story and gameplay. While the Overlord is controlled in a third person perspective, the way minions are controlled brings elements of real-time strategy and upgrades bring those of role-playing games. The game uses dark humour, and is a satirical parody of the traditional fantasy setting and plot",

It can run in either single-player or two-player mode, and can use a head-to-head feature by modem. All the usual forces of the modern army are present, but by this time heavy laser weapons have become practical, soldiers wear powered armor, unmanned ground strike aircraft are common, tanks can hover as well as roll, and artillery projectiles are even more powerful and accurate than they are today.\n\nYou command your army, which may incorporate some U. S. forces, in the European theater. Some of the opposing forces answer to a corporate conglomerate. The roles of offensive, defensive, and supply assets have to balanced properly. The game progresses through a series of land battles over various kinds of terrain -- and the terrain gives varying combinations of advantages and disadvantages. The game has some limited representation of Europe\u0027s real-world geographical features, which gives a sense of why they are militarily important. For example, you can see the importance of the Fulda Gap, just as it was important in previous World Wars, and just as it would have been important if the Cold War had become hot.\n\nEach battle has one or more objectives, and also a time limit. To win, you must accomplish your objectives while stopping the enemy from accomplishing his, and you must do this before time runs out. Each objective accomplished earns you a certain number of victory points. At the battle\u0027s end, the winner is the player with the most victory points."
