Chief of Military Operations for the Extra Terrestrial Encounter Organization (ETEO), you and your team have been brought in to investigate a series of strange happenings. Ever since the Roswell incident it has been clear that Earth has been visited by other beings, now a hundred years later it would seem that something similar may be happening on the moon. Contact with a distant lunar outpost was lost shortly after they reported discovery of a ‘hatch’ of alien origin during a routine excavation. What follows could be the next giant leap forward for mankind, but just what are we stepping into? Whatever it is, erratic energy readings from deep below the lunar surface has you thinking that it will not be a diplomatic mission. \n \nWelcome to the Moon Major.",

The game was designed and developed by Tech-Noir Productions and Ste Cork. Overkill was Epic\u0027s first vertical shooter. The game was lacking some of the technology that other top shareware games of the time had, such as Jill of the Jungle, ID Software\u0027s Commander Keen, and Apogee\u0027s Duke Nukem. It boasted EGA graphics, PC speaker sound effects, support for a joystick, and a General MIDI musical track. While the game did sell a considerable amount of copies, it was quickly overshadowed by later vertical shooters such as Raptor: Call of the Shadows, Major Stryker, and Tyrian. There are two versions of the game, the shareware version, and the commercial version. The shareware version allows the user to play planets one and two, while the commercial version grants access to all six planets. \n \nAs of July 23, 2008 the game is available as freeware.",

Little does Kabuto know that the Island was home to others before him. In the oceans, there dwells a matriarchal race called the Sea Reapers.

    "summary": "F.I.S.H. is an intense, fast paced rhythm game that relies on cues and quick reactions.  \n \nYour job working for the Department of F.I.S.H. is to enforce road safety onto any fish swimming towards an area that they\u0027re not supposed to be in. You accomplish this if you can successfully input a STOP sign when the fish are close enough on screen; if you\u0027re too early or too late, said fish will swim by as if the STOP sign wasn\u0027t even there. How rude! \n \nAs your training progresses, you\u0027ll learn about the 5 different types of fish that are known to disregard road safety in the city of [CLASSIFIED]. They are: Tuna, Salmon, Barracuda, Sailfish, and Swordfish. Each fish has a unique timing that changes dependent on the speed of the music. \n \nAt the end of each level, you\u0027ll be judged based on a score out of 30. Score a 15/30 or higher, and you can move on to the next level (unless it\u0027s the last one). Score anything lower, and you\u0027ll have to retry the level until you get a 15 or higher. \n \nAs of the current version, F.I.S.H. features a singleplayer campaign of 15 levels. There may be extra levels added in future updates.",

    "summary": "Guitar Hero: On Tour is a series of music video games based on the Guitar Hero series for the Nintendo DS handheld game system. The series is developed by Vicarious Visions and distributed by RedOctane and Activision. Three games in the series have been released since June 2008: Guitar Hero: On Tour, Guitar Hero On Tour: Decades and Guitar Hero On Tour: Modern Hits. \n \nAs with other games in the Guitar Hero series, the player is challenged to play through the lead or bass guitar portions of rock songs by matching colored notes that scroll on screen towards the player in time with physical actions to score points and keep the virtual crowd pleased. While the console versions of Guitar Hero use a separate guitar-shaped peripheral, Vicarious Visions developed a \"Guitar Grip\" unit that slips into the Game Boy Advance port on the DS or the DS Lite to be used with the games; the Grip is incompatible with the Nintendo DSi and Nintendo 3DS. The Guitar Grip provides a strap to hold the game unit while providing the player with four fret buttons; the player uses the fret buttons in combination with using the stylus to simulate strumming on the touch-sensitive screen of the DS. Each game features more than 25 songs, with some variation in track lists depending on the region of release, and multiple single-player modes. The local wi-fi capabilities of the DS are used for multiplayer mode, and allow a player to use songs from one installment of the series in competitive modes with a player with a different installment.",

Each one takes you to a different matrix of levels, which can be played in different orders and each consist of 10 screens, with a bonus level at the end.\n\nYou have limited energy, which can be recharged by collecting crystals. Fuel is limited, and is reduced by contact with hazards - generating a replacement GERALD takes time. There are many gates which are opened by running into spaces of the same colour. There are also aliens to avoid, and most movement is along thin slippery ledges with heavily inertia-based controls.",

After much bickering between the pair, Jones somehow inadvertently sets free a horde of ghosts contained in the school\u0027s secret paranormal research lab. An errant apparition materialises, grabs Anna, and drags her away with him to a dark, eerie place (the school canteen, perhaps?). One of the wayward spooks (Astral) also manages to \u0027bond\u0027 with Jones, giving him the gift of supernatural sight, allowing him to see dead people. Nice. Picking up the reins as Laz, you\u0027ll start out in search of Anna, and attempt to figure out the mysteries buried deep in the school\u0027s past along the way...",

It was released for ten different 8 and 16-bit platforms, including MS-DOS, Atari ST, and Commodore 64. It is Infocom\u0027s nineteenth game.\n\nWith a circus-themed plot, the game\u0027s tagline was \"Big-time suspense under the Big Top!\"\n\nThe player\u0027s character is bedazzled by the spectacle of the circus and the mystery of the performer\u0027s life. After attending a show of Tomas Munrab\u0027s \"The Travelling Circus That Time Forgot\", the player loiters near the tents instead of rushing through the exit. Maybe some clowns will practice a new act, or perhaps at least one of the trapeze artists will trip...\n\nInstead, the player overhears a strange conversation. The circus\u0027 owner has hired a drunken, inept detective to find his daughter Chelsea, who has been kidnapped. Munrab is convinced that it was an outside job; surely his loyal employees would never betray him like this!\n\nAs the player begins to investigate the abduction, it soon becomes clear that the circus workers don\u0027t appreciate the intrusion. Their reactions range from indifference to hostility to attempted murder. In order to unravel the mystery, the player engages in a series of actions straight out of a circus fan\u0027s dream: dressing up as a clown, walking the high wire, and taming lions.",

STRATUM is a 2D platformer, a trekking game that is based a lot on the dialogue between 2 entities and boss fighting in a universe parallel to ours. Everything in STRATUM takes place in the first century AD, in a world that wraps our own universe, called  The Stratum. A parallel Universe which is thought to be the realm of the Christian deities. In this game you will play as a Dacian warrior, unfamiliar with everything in this world, you’ll get to know and understand The Stratum together with him. The story is unconventional, it plays down a lot of the mysticism of Hell or Heaven and it gives it a more rational view while keeping the fantastic in it. The STRATUM is not very different from Earth, but it is governed by different natural laws.",

As in the MLB Show series, the player may only control one character and cannot control others on their team or make any management decisions. The player\u0027s role of the team will be determined by their performance on and off the court. The better the player is at playing basketball and being a teammate, the more likelier they will be a huge part of the team and receive better contracts and endorsement deals. \n \nLikewise, the decisions the player makes off the court will determine who they are perceived as well, such as how they interact with teammates, what they buy or who they hang around with. The player can also train their character through a series of 20 mini-games, e.g. one-on-one, three-on-three, etc. \n \nThe game also features Showtime Gameplay, where the player may increase attributes and become a better team player with no-look alley-oops and highlight reel dunks. It also has online capabilities as well as the option of utilizing the EyeToy to put the user\u0027s face onto a created character.",

    "summary": "Fresh out of the lair of Dreamatrix Game Studios, Legends of Dawn invites players to the brutal northerly reaches of Narr. Survival depends on you, your magic and your sword.\nWhat sets Legends of Dawn apart, is the freedom of play expressed in several key attributes that are rarely seen in typical RPG genres. We have poured our passion and creativity into taking you on an enthralling ride away from wearisome reality, by providing you with the choice to be whatever your heart desires, in Legends of Dawn.\n\nOf course, the choices you make during game play does not prevent you from trying something else later, or simultaneously if you wish. You could combine the sword and the magic, be a powerful crafter or anything else. Legends of Dawn liberates from class restrictions unlike real life. Class, race and differences exist within the game but after choosing your own race and gender, all else can be altered without restarting the game.\n\nAnother quality that makes Legends of Dawn interesting, is the freedom of direction and movement. Most games force a player to follow the main storyline and forbid any deviation, or significant veering off the set course. Legends of Dawn is more sympathetic to your playing needs. You are free to wander wherever tickles your fancy within the continent, without limitations, under one condition. Stay alive. We have been careful to ensure that the quests only suggest, rather than impose direction of movement. Your journey is in your hands alone.\n\nIn addition to all those remarkable features already mentioned, you are bound to notice another cool thing about Legends of Dawn. The absence of loading screen. It would have been so much easier to create a game that would constantly force you to wait before the screen while new contents load, but Dreamatrix is aware that your time is too valuable to waste. We put our heads together and created our very own engine that discreetly streams content in the background, in real time. You are free to enter houses, caves, dungeons, temples, new regions and so much more, without those pesky loading screens interrupting your playing pleasure.\n\nIn order to provide you with such blissful range of possibilities, we had to create a rather large world called Narr. The world of Narr in Legends of Dawn, spans across continents through stunning picturesque landscape that stimulates the mind. There are magical regions where the mountains and hills defy gravity, buoyant as balloons. We have also created countless dungeons awaiting for you to discover what mysteries lie within their cold depths, as well as camps, impressive docks and grim fortresses that bear silent witness to battles. Mausoleums and cemeteries also await your exploration. The hikes over unforgiving mountains and canyons are sure to thrill the most ardent explorer. Graceful flying islands and mystical swamps instil a sense of awe that could nudge you to cross the threshold of the serene temples and shrines to pay your respects to the gods of the land. With so much more on offer than is mentioned here, there is no reason why Legends of Dawn should not become your favourite RPG.",

There’s an assortment of objectives to keep you on your toes: tiles that chase you, tiles that must be matched within a few moves, tiles that must be protected, and lots more. \n \nAs well as 38 free-form stages which play out differently every time, we have created 75 challenges with unique solutions, so the game is crammed with content to keep you busy!",

In order to do this, Quaid must go through level after level of beating up bad guys that get in his way.\n\nSome of the levels differ in gameplay, and range between action and driving scenes. The action scenes mainly require you to collect some items before leaving the level. You have only one chance to complete the current level, which means that if your energy is lost, the game ends. Energy is lost if you are attacked by an obstacle, or if you are shot at by an enemy. You can gain more energy by either collecting some pills or a heart, depending on the platform.",

    "summary": "Aura Kingdom takes place in an anime-styled vast world rendered with detailed graphics. The game consists of primarily open world with instances that can either be partaken as solo or in a party. Players can choose between a variety of classes, with ten classes released and an upcoming one, as of May 2014. The players can freely customize their character or avatar with many choices of hair styles and faces and much more. It is then proceeded with the choice of four Eidolons, who will accompany the player throughout the game, while also giving the ability to earn other Eidolons.\nWithin the game, the player can interact with many non-player characters and enter combat mode with monsters outside of the hub world. The combat system is primarily the player using a wide variety of skills corresponding with the class against the monsters, who also have their own set of skills. The majority of the game is to simply attack and defeat the monsters along the way while partaking quests. The combat system is unique in a way that, although the player has to click on a monster to engage in combat, the player also has the ability to move to dodge and use their skills in a variety of ways. With an accompanying Eidolon, the player\u0027s Eidolon can also fight alongside their character, and also use a combination attack. The combat system is not merely a \"click-and-watch\" combat. Outside of the combat system, the player can also engage in several different tasks, such as fishing, crafting, and many more.\n\nWhile the game is situated in a free-to-play environment, the game also allows the players to purchase Aeria Points, or for short AP, that allows the players to use that monetary value for special in-game items found in the Item Mall. Otherwise, the game uses the gold and silver tactic, which can be acquired a number of ways. The game also allows the use of trade, a self-installed stall in Navea, and the Auction House. Players can also use the mailing system to mail other players using the cash-on-delivery system.",

The game wasn\u0027t quite as well received as its predecessors, but at the time was widely considered to be the best racing simulation available. \n  \nAn add-on to the game, called GP3-2000 or GP32k, was released by Hasbro which updated the game to the 2000 Formula One season. A few other changes were made as well including: updated damage physics including damage from on-circuit debris, improved AI, a new replay system, and EAX 3D-sound.  \n  \nSince the release of Grand Prix 4, the GP3 modding scene has slowly declined, and with the cracking of track editing for GP4 many track modders left GP3 for the newer title.",

The success is measured in ground targets: a team loses when they only have their headquarters left. To capture a target (some have to be simply destroyed), the team has to bring its defenses down and then bring in troops (for example with a C-47). However, this is not enough because - depending on the damage taken - it first has to be built up again. The time this takes depend on various factors, e.g. what other near targets are available, and can be sped up with supply drops by transport aircraft. Available ground installments also have other effects, e.g. the availability of ammo or troops.\n\nThe majority of of the action is fought in the air with World War II aircraft, but there are also ground (e.g. tanks) and naval vehicles available. The matches itself are of a grand scale and can take multiple hours; afterwards the map is reset. Overall the controls are somewhere between simulation and action. Depending on the arena, which can also be crafted with the editor, the exact winning conditions can be slightly different. While the multiplayer matches are subscription-based, there is also a free offline mode for training included.\n\nIn the years after release, the game was under continuous development and saw many minor and major changes. This includes World War I vehicles, a tool to record/replay gameplay footage and changes to the technical framework resulting in updated system requirements."

His captors have instructed him to unfasten the screws and bolts on a large enemy ship, promising to return him to his home if he is successful.\n\nSuccess will take good puzzle-solving skills though (and perhaps a little luck), as the falling pieces from the unfastened ship could put a quick end to Gubble\u0027s efforts.

Along with foes from his past, Mega Man must contend with the next robot in Wily\u0027s line of \"Mega Man Killers\", Punk. Like its two consecutive predecessors on the Game Boy, the game combines elements from two previously released Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) titles: Mega Man 3 and Mega Man 4. In 2013, Mega Man III was made available on the Virtual Console of Japan\u0027s Nintendo eShop for the Nintendo 3DS. It was later released in the North American and PAL region eShops the following year.",

From acclaimed Game Director, Mike Bithell (Volume, Thomas Was Alone, Subsurface Circular), John Wick Hex is a fast-paced, action-oriented strategy game that makes you think and strike like the professional hitman. \n \nCreated in close cooperation with the creative teams behind the films, John Wick Hex is fight-choreographed chess brought to life as a video game, capturing the series’ signature gun fu style while expanding its story universe. Players must choose every action and attack they make, while considering their immediate cost and consequences. Every move in John Wick Hex feels like a scene from the movies, and every fight contributes to your progress on the job and requires precise strategic thinking. \n \nPerform well and progress in the main story mode (which features an original story created for the game) to unlock new weapons, suit options and locations. Each weapon changes up the tactics you’ll use and the manner in which you’ll play. Ammo is finite and realistically simulated, so time your reloads and make the most of weapons you scavenge on the job.",

However, legend tells of three red Orbs which are said to hold the key to the Pah-wraiths\u0027 resurrection and return to the Temple, although none of these Orbs have ever been located. Or so it is thought. \n \nThe game is loosely based on a trilogy of novels by Judith and Garfield Reeves-Stevens called Millennium: The Fall of Terok Nor, The War of the Prophets, and Inferno.

The game starts when Jade receives a message from him telling her where to find the gun he left in her apartment. As soon as she grabs the gun, the door bursts open .. and the first gunfight begins. \n \nThe game is played out in five fast-and-furious chapters, all of which are timed. Jade will trek through exotic European locales (including the Swiss Alps and the London Underground), shooting baddies and bosses. The faster you shoot each wave of enemies the better, as the time saved is added to the next chapter. \n \nThe environment is totally destructible. You can shoot pictures off the walls, shoot cabinets open and have glassware crash to the floor and otherwise wreck much of your surroundings. Also, you can cause explosions that will kill all the enemies in the vicinity. \n \nFinishing the game the first time unlocks additional modes of play and mini-games.",
