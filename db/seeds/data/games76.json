These resource-stripping activities threaten the local flora and fauna, especially the Mountain Wampus, who get hunted for their treasure. \n \nAs a young wampus, players set out to rid Irata of the settler invaders and restore harmony to the land. While a fun lark, Wampus explores themes of environmentalism, conservationism, stewardship of the land, and the destructive nature of colonialism."

    "summary": "Age of Empires is a real-time strategy game where players build a great civilisation out of an Ice Age tribe over a period of 10,000 years. Players accomplish this by exploring their surroundings, conquering other civilisations and accumulating wealth. Key elements include building and controlling units and managing resources. \nAge of Empires 2: The Age of Kings starts the player out in the Dark Ages, roughly when Age of Empires ends. The goal remains the same: use advanced technology and troops to establish your civilisation\u0027s dominance. But now the player has better toys: each of the 13 civilisations have unique buildings, soldiers and advantages. The Teutons have Knights, for instance, while the Vikings have Berserkers. Winning the game requires military dominance or the construction of wonders of the world. The single-player game is fun, but most players love Age of Empires 2 for its wildly popular multiplayer component. Thousands of civilisations rise and fall every day as gamers around the world compete in matches over the Internet. \n \nThis bundle includes Age of Empires: Gold Edition, containing the original Age of Empires and Age of Empires: The Rise of Rome Expansion, plus Age of Empires II: The Age of Kings and Age of Empires II: The Conqueror\u0027s Expansion. The bundle is great for fans of the series to have all of the titles in one place; and for newbies it is less expensive than buying all the titles separately.",

    "summary": "Dyscourse is an interactive choice-based narrative adventure game where you journey through a stylized world of choice and consequence. You play as Rita, an unfortunate art school grad turned barista, who is now stuck on a desert island with a crew of oddball travelers after a plane crash. That last choice you just made? It may end up being integral to your group’s survival, or it may lead you down a path to murder and cannibalism. \n \nStories in Dyscourse are emergent, and choices made in the game directly tie to the survival or downfall of the group. As players get to know their fellow castaways and make critical and interpersonal decisions, drama dynamically unfolds, and your choices author your own unique story. \n \nWe\u0027ve designed Dyscourse so that players will end up with vastly different stories forged from their choices - everyone’s playthrough will have a unique story to tell. With over 120,000 words and many hours of replayable content, each playthrough allows players to explore more of the overall “story space” and learn more about the crash and their fellow survivors. There are no ‘good’ or ‘bad’ choices and endings to Dyscourse - how to best survive the island is a decision left up to the player. Choose wisely.",

Rin is drawn there because six years ago, she made a promise to a little girl in the hospital. Over an online chatroom, she promised the girl she would come visit her. When she got there, the girl wasn\u0027t anywhere to be found. Rin thought \"The Black Page\" might hold some answers. Shin loves anime and the supernatural and was drawn to \"The Black Page\". After Chiyo Kishibe\u0027s grandson bought her a laptop, she heard rumors of \"The Black Page\". She thought she might be able to meet her late husband. As for Makoto Shirae, an editor for a newspaper, his friend died under mysterious circumstances. When he took over the investigation, it led him to \"The Black Page\". After entering a chatroom on the site, Rin, Shin, Chiyo and Makoto are soon drawn into a strange void that lies between life and death which manifests the memories of the dead known as the Mnemonic Abyss. Using their cell phones, these people must try and escape from it.",

Increase speed, efficiency and capacity with these vehicles:\n- Stern-Berger Midi - A product of Swiss standard in solid quality and innovative looks, Midi is a bus primarily intended for dense urban areas. Its light weight, rather short wheelbase and low flooring enable easy maneuvering and boarding.\n- Pavlov P-42 - Pavlov Aeronautika factories were established as part of the Pavlov enterprises in the mid-1910s. Ivan Pavlov, a pioneer in rotorcraft design, himself piloted the P-42 on its maiden flight. Originally designed for anti-submarine warfare use, it soon became immensely popular in air taxi business as well. A robust helicopter with relatively low empty weight and slow acceleration, it is especially suited to cover mid-distance passenger and goods transportation needs.\n- Stingray Cityjet - The Stingray Cityjet is a fast short-distance catamaran of Australian origin. Recently announced third generation of these vessels have high fuel efficiency and notably low noise emission. These vessels are aimed for regular ferry service and sightseeing use, featuring comfortable seating and a service deck.\n- Vagabondo Satellite - Italian-built Vagabondo trams first saw use in Rome during the upgrading of the municipal rail network. The Satellite is a very reliable, although not the most visually appealing, single-body six-axle tram with a partial low-floor configuration. It has driving cabins on both ends of the frame.\n- Crescenta T4 Suburbia - A Danish creation, the Crescenta T4 Suburbia is a combined metro/light railway train configuration primarily intended for use between traffic hubs and countryside towns. Its design reflects the origin in more traditional commuter",

The game was scheduled to be officially released on October 3 (the anniversary of German reunification) 2010, but was delayed due to its controversy. The game was released in December 2010 following \"a public discussion with distinguished guests\" at the Karlsruhe University, and will have an age rating of 18+.",

While there is a released Pinocchio game for the Game Boy mono, \"Adventures of…\" is a completely different title and Bit Managers never listed this one on their homepage, only Ottifanten.\nA playable version of this beta was leaked online, and it\u0027s often confused for an official released game. Trying out the game shows that you cannot lose any lives – the counter won\u0027t work. This is no final release and there is none because it\u0027s an unreleased game.\n\nA closer look at the dump floating around will reveal a weird internal name \"Infrey Quest\", so we can speculate that before Pinocchio and Ottifanten, Bit Managers tried to develop their own original IP. When they did not find any publisher interested in Infrey Quest, they changed the game in Pinocchio and later into Ottifanten, with their more recognized characters.\n\nOttifanten uses the same game concept as well and the same music as Adventure of Pinocchio. It even looks like the basic stage design is the same.",

On the screen you will see bars moving from the top to bottom in columns representing each of the keys and the turntable. When the bars reach the judgement line it is time to scratch. \n \nUnlike the arcade counterpart, the PlayStation version does not have a combo counter. EXPERT mode is also missing from this version of the game.",

    "summary": "Tomba! is a side-scrolling platformer in which players control Tomba, a wild boy on the search for his grandfather\u0027s bangle that was stolen by some evil pigs. Although Tomba is normally restricted to a two-dimensional plane, there are certain points where he can jump or climb onto a new plane. Tomba\u0027s main method of attack is to jump on top of enemies to grab them, allowing him to hop around on them before throwing them away. This can also be used to open other objects such as eggs or treasure chests. Tomba is also able to use various projectile weapons such as maces and boomerangs and can swing on branches and poles.\n\nThe game is based around a mission system, where the main character\u0027s (Tomba\u0027s) skills are employed to complete various tasks. Completion of a mission gives a certain amount of adventure points (AP) which are required for AP boxes which contain food (which gives you AP and restores 1 space of vitality) or items, and you may for example need 50,000 AP to open one. AP is also used to gain access to special places or information later in the game. Not all missions are necessary to progress in the game, however, they are required to achieve full completion. There are 130 events (missions) in the game, many of them rely on other events to be completed.",

While you will usually need to take a tactical approach to gameplay when on foot, you will earn points called \"Field Units\" that can be used to buy equipment like tanks and gun turrets to destroy Axis soldiers. You can simply buy equipment by using the Y button on your controller in conjunction with the left thumbstick button to select an item to buy.\n\nAs such, the game developers call The Outfit \"destruction on demand\". The equipment you buy with Field Units will initially be occupied by AI-controlled soldiers, but you can replace whoever is using the equipment so that you can have some fun blowing stuff up. Sporting a fully destructible environment, almost everything in The Outfit can be blown up.\n\nYou can play as one of three characters. Tommy Mac can take lots of damage before dying, and comes equipped with a flamethrower and machine gun, but equipment will cost him more Field Units than other characters. Deuce Williams comes equipped with a rocket launcher and pistol, and doesn\u0027t need as much Field Units to buy stuff as Tommy does, but he isn\u0027t nearly as strong as Tommy. JD Tyler is the most accurate of the three, sporting a sniper rifle and shotgun, but unfortunately he will die with one shot, so he must take an extremely tactical approach to gameplay.",

    "summary": "Activision Blizzard\u0027s top-selling first-person shooter franchise marches on with Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3. Players must deal with the fallout from the devastating attacks on U.S. and British soil in a storyline that picks up where 2009\u0027s Modern Warfare 2 left off. The single-player campaign has you battling Russian ultranationalists, led by Vladimir Markov, as members of the U.S. Delta Force and British SAS. You\u0027ll battle across war-torn areas of New York City, London, Paris, Mogadishu, Dubai, and other regions as you prepare to end the global threat once and for all.\n\nAs with previous entries in the Call of Duty series, Modern Warfare 3\u0027s campaign features a heavily scripted, cinematic experience with Hollywood-style special effects. One new mission, for example, has you involved in underwater travel with a sonar-equipped submersible watercraft. You\u0027ll then fight inside an enemy-controlled submarine before guiding an inflatable raft across turbulent waters while a naval battle rages nearby. Other sequences have you firing mounted guns, driving vehicles, and more while explosions light up the landscape.\n\nReturning to the game is the cooperative Spec Ops mode that features a series of standalone missions on different maps. New to Spec Ops is a survival option that has you and either a friend or a computer partner battling waves of enemy forces. Shooting down enemies earns you cash, which can be used to purchase new perks, items, weapons, and other upgrades. You\u0027ll also be able to earn bonuses by working together as a team and maintaining kill streaks.\n\nThe heart of the game is once again the 18-player online component, which introduces all-new maps and a variety of enhancements to the format introduced in Modern Warfare 2. Popular features such as kill-streak awards, experience points, weapons-based achievements, and perks return, allowing you to customize your character as you progress. An optional subscription service entitled \"Call of Duty Elite\" will allow players to track detailed statistics such as win-loss records, kill-death ratios, time played, most successful maps, favorite weapons, and much more.\n\nHardened Edition bonus items include a Steelbook case, collectible field journal, special ops juggernaut outfit for your Xbox Live avatar, premium membership to Call of Duty Elite, and special founder status on Call of Duty Elite. Call of Duty Elite\u0027s premium membership includes all future downloadable content (DLC) for Modern Warfare 3, of which there are 20 pieces of DLC expected within the first nine months following the game\u0027s release.",

The previous game\u0027s producer, writer and character designer returned to their respective roles. The game was designed as a more mainstream game in light of the previous game\u0027s dark aesthetic and story. The game sold 206,000 copies by the end of 2005. Western reviews praised the story, but gave mixed opinions about the graphics and widely criticized the gameplay.",

The project was eventually shelved after Eidos and SCi had marketing concerns about Core returning to the Tomb Raider IP.\n\nCore was sold to Rebellion Developments in 2006, terminating the development on TRAE. In its place, Crystal Dynamics developed their own remake of the original Tomb Raider called Tomb Raider: Anniversary. It was announced in 2006 after a presentation of Core\u0027s game leaked online and released in the following yaer.\n\nFollowing a PSP prototype build of TRAE being made public in 2020, TRAE has been actively restored by fans and there\u0027s now an early playable PC build available. It is notable for being more faithful to the original game\u0027s level design than the 2007 remake, while still adding new mechanics and updating technical aspects.",

As you pick up momentum, you start to glow, the bars you\u0027re collecting rise up, the music kicks in, and your trajectory burns a bright red line in the air, drawing huge, beautiful mathematical curves of your arcing flight.\n\nAlso the name is a pun, so that\u0027s cool.",
