The mechanic of rewinding time allows the player to redo any action that has been taken.

Items that are collected before time travelling will be kept in the inventory after the fact. \n \nThe player can explore various locations in the fictional setting of Arcadia Bay and communicate with non-playable characters. Dialogue exchanges can be rewound while branching options are used for conversation. Once an event is reset, the details provided earlier are permitted to avail themselves in the future.

The objective is to clear each stage within the planet's three areas: the lush and tropical Atoll, the glacial and snowy Northpole, and the toxic and jungle-like Swamps. Within each stage lies a set number of solar cells, many of which are scattered about and some of which are hidden, that Jett must collect in order to unlock each stage and gain access to the subsequent areas. Additionally, Jett must defeat a general of the PPP at the end of each area. As with standard platforming games, Jett is capable of jumping, but can briefly hover when using his jet pack.[4] Within certain stages, he can also paraglide as well as either ride a hoverboard or a jetboat. In addition, Jett can defeat enemies, clear obstacles and activate switches with his \"Dash\" attack, which can be executed by shaking the Wii Remote while he is standing (which sees him perform a somersaulting tackle) or after a jump (which sees him perform a diving hammer fist). The game also features an achievement system that can be completed either during or after completion of the main story.","tags":[18,268435464,536871882,536871904,536871945,536875073,536875130,536875271,536876639]},{"id":117609,"cover":{"id":104387,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co28jn.jpg"},"name":"Rune Lord","platforms":[{"id":6,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"},{"id":14,"name":"Mac"},{"id":48,"name":"PlayStation 4"},{"id":49,"name":"Xbox One"},{"id":130,"name":"Nintendo Switch"}],"screenshots":[{"id":299605,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc6f6d.jpg"},{"id":299606,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc6f6e.jpg"},{"id":299607,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc6f6f.jpg"},{"id":299608,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc6f6g.jpg"},{"id":299609,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc6f6h.jpg"},{"id":299610,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc6f6i.jpg"},{"id":299611,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc6f6j.jpg"},{"id":299612,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc6f6k.jpg"}],"summary":"A portal has opened and dark magic is pouring through!

The kingdom comprises several islands, and is described as being largely isolated from the outside world. The player can travel between different islands after obtaining a magic map.\n\nThe center of the kingdom is the Isle of the Crown, which has an Arabian Nights theme. The Isle of Wonder is inspired by Alice in Wonderland, and the Isle of the Sacred Mountain is inspired by Classical mythology. The Isle of the Beast is heavily forested and scattered with magical barriers. There also are additional hidden areas. One of these is inhabited by a tribe of druids, while another gives the player the option to confront Death.\n\nThe game's opening cutscene shows Prince Alexander haunted by his memories of Princess Cassima, who he met at the end of King's Quest V when they were both rescued from the wizard Mordack. After seeing a vision of Cassima in the magical mirror that his father acquired in the first King's Quest, he sails to find her. At the beginning of the game he is shipwrecked on the shore of the Isle of the Crown, where he learns that the vizier Abdul Alhazred (named after the author of the fictional Necronomicon) has assumed control in Cassima's absence, and plans to force her marry him.

Only the Spell of Spells would be able to free them. Merlin, knowing that the world would come to ruin without King Arthur uses his magic to search all of space and time for replacements. Finding the New York Knights football team and their quarterback, Arthur King, Merlin transports them back to Camelot and gives them magical armor. Transformed into; Sir Arthur, Sir Breeze, Sir Brick, Sir Darren, Sir Gallop, Sir Lancelot, Sir Lug, Sir Phil, Sir Tone, Sir Trunk, Sir Wally and Sir Zeke, they must rescue the real Knights of the Round Table.

However in order to be able to defeat them, Arthur must first recover Excalibur and overcome other tasks.\n\nKing Arthur & the Knights of Justice is a top-down action game. It might be mistaken for an RPG, however the abilities of characters do not change over the course of the game. Players control Arthur King and can recruit two additional party members from the knights. Each knight has his own statistics in various areas including: Life Force, Defense, Strength and Speed. These party members are computer controlled with their own energy bars. Arthur can move up, down, left and right, block with his shield and parry with his shield. Arthur can swing his sword at any time but the damage inflicted depends on how much strength bar he has. The strength bar replenishes itself naturally over time, but is depleted every time Arthur swings his sword. Each knight including Arthur has a health bar, when this bar runs out, the knight is defeated. It can be restored by returning to Camelot or using items such as healing herbs. Arthur can carry a variety of different items accessible from the menu. Other menu functions include looking at the map, changing preferences and reviewing the statistics of the knights.","tags":[1,268435468,268435487,536871208,536871244,536871945,536872733,536873066,536873400,536874745,536875058,536875106,536875292,536875331,536875639,536875791,536875793,536876007,536876410,536876847,536876974,536877148,536878323,536878439,536879216,536880444,536884116]},{"id":153080,"cover":{"id":154034,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co3auq.jpg"},"name":"Putahe ng Ina Mo","platforms":[{"id":6,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"},{"id":14,"name":"Mac"},{"id":82,"name":"Web browser"}],"summary":"Missing your nanay's home cooked meal?

Excavate the foundation of a house with realistic machines, pour concrete into the wall panels of a factory with an enormous concrete pump, or test the steadiness of your hands by placing gigantic roof trusses with a mobile crane. Thanks to the realistic controls, you can steer an excavator with two joysticks using SAE controls and feel as if you are working on a real construction site.\n\nExplore an expansive, freely navigable world with various towns, fields, and even a highway – you will find a variety of new challenges for your constantly growing motor pool. Try out new vehicles before you buy them at the construction machine dealer, have repairs done at the repair shop, and visit the local city hall for public calls for tenders. If you are successful, then even larger and more lucrative jobs and various office locations with even more possibilities will beckon.\n\nWork is more fun with friends, and construction is no exception. Operate vehicles with friends in multiplayer mode, and complete construction missions together or just play around in the wide-open game world.\n\nUp to four workers can participate in multiplayer games. The player who opens the game serves as the host and takes the lead role in running a construction company shared by the other players in a cooperative game.\n\nIn a single game, you can work together to accomplish construction tasks. Dig pits together using multiple excavators, while another player transports the excavated material to a gravel plant. In an advanced game, you can work on up to three construction sites at one time and really start raking in money with your construction company.\n\nAre 200 working stages in over 150 different missions not enough for you? The Construction Simulator 2015 offers plenty of opportunities to integrate your own vehicles and construction sites into the game. You can use the developer’s own Construction Kit to shape your own worlds and create your own game content.\n\nYou can of course also share your mods with the wider community of fans through Steamworks or on fan sites. This way, a huge community of players can access an endless and varied supply of user-created content.\n\nThe barrier to entry into the world of modding is not particularly high – all you really need is a 3D graphics program like 3ds max or Maya as well as the free version of Unity3D.","tags":[268435466,268435469,536871013,536871690,536871784,536871906,536872060,536872070,536872205,536872245,536872315,536872371,536874706,536874916,536875046,536875047,536875069,536875187,536876066,536876423,536877176,536881417],"videos":[{"id":14477,"video_id":"ejTPJp7ot4Q"},{"id":14478,"video_id":"oZq8mPDJyzE"},{"id":14479,"video_id":"gO-Vh0JTljc"}]},{"id":27514,"aggregated_rating":71.0,"cover":{"id":103300,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co27pg.jpg"},"name":"Gravel","platforms":[{"id":6,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"},{"id":48,"name":"PlayStation 4"},{"id":49,"name":"Xbox One"}],"screenshots":[{"id":71990,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/pvkfecxmd91phmdvibfp.jpg"},{"id":71991,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/gmumdrvsyff8mq90o0d5.jpg"},{"id":71992,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/yfck2wt6lvzoa6odtulc.jpg"},{"id":71993,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/abesfdzasmtv3eie4z0p.jpg"},{"id":71994,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/bcetks1g3iwt8rrc76us.jpg"}],"summary":"Gravel is the only title in the market that includes the most extreme mix of off-road competitions ever seen in a game!","tags":[268435466,268435469,268435470,268435489,536871042,536871730,536871881,536871906,536872060,536872654,536873297,536875046,536875269,536880749,536888306,536888307,536888308,536888309],"videos":[{"id":12449,"video_id":"2oqE0HQrDwk"},{"id":15216,"video_id":"Fcbr8P8Isg4"}]},{"id":193007,"cover":{"id":211780,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co4jes.jpg"},"name":"Minabo: A walk through life","platforms":[{"id":6,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"},{"id":14,"name":"Mac"}],"screenshots":[{"id":747975,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scg153.jpg"},{"id":747979,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scg157.jpg"},{"id":747982,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scg15a.jpg"},{"id":747986,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scg15e.jpg"},{"id":747987,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scg15f.jpg"}],"summary":"Minabo - A walk through life is a social simulation game where you walk the path of life while your turnip grows and thrives (or not) in its social relationships.","tags":[268435469,268435488]},{"id":71950,"cover":{"id":85642,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co1u2y.jpg"},"name":"Blobby Volley","platforms":[{"id":6,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}],"screenshots":[{"id":344128,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc7dj4.jpg"}],"summary":"A volleyball mini-game where 2 blobs have to win by having the ball touch the ground on opponent's side.","tags":[268435470,536872078]},{"id":52909,"cover":{"id":29132,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/hii9mu5tdeeczehs2sqa.jpg"},"name":"Taco Master","platforms":[{"id":46,"name":"PlayStation Vita"}],"screenshots":[{"id":116935,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/jk40aiybydw6vzxwnebd.jpg"},{"id":116936,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/dmox33vt39nltvdc06vd.jpg"},{"id":116937,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/ja7vtsnhz88yte5wsolh.jpg"},{"id":116938,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/lru5zrma2eliwnevvo4x.jpg"},{"id":116939,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/dtiv5v6bj3bgfkgawgcu.jpg"}],"summary":"Fast-paced, finger-flicking fun, it's time to put your reactions to the test!

You rise up and glide across the seascape. \n\nDEEP is a meditative and psychoactive VR game that is controlled by breathing. Players don the Oculus Rift and the custom DEEP controller to explore a beautiful and mysterious undersea world. Allow the game to sweep you into its relaxing embrace as it teaches you yogic breathing techniques that can relieve stress, anxiety and mild depression. Take a DEEP breath and soar beneath the waves to meet ancient gods and strange lifeforms. \n\nThe custom controller measures diaphragm expansion in order to sense deep breathing. This information is fed back to the player in a variety of visual cues, intimately linking their consciousness and breath. The environment's layout gently encourages the player to slow their breath, to sink deeper and relax. It can be played for therapeutic or aesthetic reasons, and does not require the use on arms, legs or hands.","tags":[268435469,268435488,536871220,536872337,536873152],"videos":[{"id":7387,"video_id":"qIhZhdmPQ_8"},{"id":7388,"video_id":"EYkWghdLNJM"}]},{"id":98561,"name":"Spelling Jungle","platforms":[{"id":6,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"},{"id":14,"name":"Mac"}]},{"id":86350,"cover":{"id":62688,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/xk6mpaztct3lv44jhbmv.jpg"},"name":"Mahjong","platforms":[{"id":159,"name":"Nintendo DSi"}],"screenshots":[{"id":181664,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/dn5o51ja2nbwdeuup4fr.jpg"},{"id":181665,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/yfo5oieohibcpittxdvz.jpg"},{"id":181666,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/emjvpt7ppwya7ron14ly.jpg"},{"id":181667,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/stha09oe3tnfqegx80bi.jpg"}],"summary":"One of the oldest games on the planet is brought to life in a new and dynamic way."},{"id":88383,"aggregated_rating":60.0,"cover":{"id":102815,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co27bz.jpg"},"name":"Trailblazers","platforms":[{"id":3,"name":"Linux"},{"id":6,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"},{"id":14,"name":"Mac"},{"id":20,"name":"Nintendo DS"},{"id":48,"name":"PlayStation 4"},{"id":49,"name":"Xbox One"},{"id":130,"name":"Nintendo Switch"}],"screenshots":[{"id":212085,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/vis6xgiz45byhnekkdmx.jpg"},{"id":212086,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/dwiv3wal1pv1eomcoxse.jpg"},{"id":212087,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/h7g9bgsstxqrsvir2omb.jpg"},{"id":212088,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/jkhdkcu3emwek2eeovnc.jpg"},{"id":212089,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/vqpszdjd0d6ckxc6n1sc.jpg"},{"id":212090,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/w4vwmtqjckcbm7wpgemm.jpg"},{"id":212091,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/nkqjylpdv6cvbyxwp71g.jpg"},{"id":212092,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/jltlsbdsxes0qyfptzch.jpg"},{"id":212093,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/vrbr009z5trvctjrrqvv.jpg"},{"id":212094,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/bwzpouyiwn6ynkfcytkh.jpg"}],"summary":"Trailblazers is a fresh new co-operative racing title with an innovative on-track game mechanic: paint the track, boost on your colour and work as a team to win!\n\nTake control of high-speed racers in unique 3v3 team races across a series of colourful circuits.

The Aliens soon hatch and wipe out the human population. However, when the Predators move in for the hunt, they find they are vastly outnumbered and suffer the same fate. Only one of them survives. He theorizes that among the hatched Aliens there was a queen that laid additional eggs, which would explain the huge number of Aliens. The last survivor sets out to destroy the queen and regain the honor of his clan. \n \nThe Predator must traverse several side-scrolling levels on his way to the queen, while destroying Aliens in all their forms - facehuggers hatched from eggs, chestburster aliens and fully grown warriors. Various weapons are available: the standard weapon are the wrist blades. Ammunition for the shoulder cannon, the cutting disks and bombs must be picked up. The bombs not only work as weapons but can also be used to destroy barriers. To avoid a fight altogether, the Predator can also use his invisibility system, which runs down the energy supply. To recharge it, energy powerups must be collected. Also hidden in the levels are keys that open up doors blocking the way into the next area. A small radar map helps in navigating the maze-like corridors and also displays approaching enemies.","tags":[1,536871213,536875054,536875065,536875162,536875358,536876208,536879049]},{"id":8818,"aggregated_rating":73.3333333333333,"cover":{"id":117587,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co2iqb.jpg"},"name":"Starpoint Gemini 2","platforms":[{"id":6,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"},{"id":49,"name":"Xbox One"}],"screenshots":[{"id":9354,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sedpyninfimjc6v8mvvp.jpg"},{"id":9355,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/wwauivsul0dstxj1bn1x.jpg"},{"id":9356,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/jrufuepe0e7z9r9pa7mf.jpg"},{"id":9357,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/fzurrkttdm7zfldu25sh.jpg"},{"id":9358,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/bjkvd7ovzzdzn76r8toq.jpg"}],"summary":"Captain your own space ship and roam the galaxy in 3D in this tactical space simulator with tons of RPG depth !

At the same time, a boy called Jack is raised by his outlawed mother in the woods. His apprenticeship as a stonemason paves his way to become a great architect. Soon, his steps lead him to Kingsbridge where he will build one of the greatest cathedrals England has ever seen. Aliena and Richard have to survive on their own, after the sibling's father, the Earl of Shiring, has been incarcerated and murdered. Aliena vows to make her brother the rightful heir and Earl of Shiring. Like Jack, their way leads them to Kingsbridge. Aliena puts her expertise as a tradeswoman to good use, supporting the cathedral's construction and falls in love with Jack. But Kingsbridge and its people are in grave danger. Philip's rivals, Bishop Waleran and Wiliam, a vengeful noble rejected by Aliena, see the town and its rise to importance as a thorn in their flesh. They want to see Kingsbridge burn. \n \nThe game-adaption of the world-bestseller \"The Pillars of the Earth\" is the first co-operative project of Daedalic Entertainment and Bastei Lübbe. This game will be more than just complementary media to the book and will instead retell the story in a new, interactive way. A team of about 20 people works to create a multi-platform adaption of this bestseller. The writers are also in contact and co-operation with the Follett Office and Ken Follett himself. Daedalic is the only studio at the time adapting such an epic reading-experience into an interactive format. \n \nThe game itself will be released in 2017, at the same time the third novel of the Kingsbridge-Series will be published. The game will be internationally available for PC, Mac, Linux, PS4, Xbox One and mobile devices.","tags":[22,31,268435458,268435465,268435487,268435488,268435490,536871063,536871874,536873338,536874111,536874169,536874446],"videos":[{"id":14595,"video_id":"S8R94YRM4bw"},{"id":14596,"video_id":"mSdFp6kcb5M"},{"id":14597,"video_id":"-UUszjHXOec"},{"id":15624,"video_id":"CewTYloQSt0"},{"id":17185,"video_id":"b0Xrt6ftryg"}]},{"id":49175,"cover":{"id":27469,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scnmbq2j3l7l0kdbamhl.jpg"},"name":"Davis Cup Tennis","platforms":[{"id":24,"name":"Game Boy Advance"}],"summary":"Enter a battle among tennis legends.

Will you look to provide the best mail distribution system but supply a small area, or are you looking to conquer the city with several offices and a vast fleet of vehicles.\n\nIn order to maintain your claim on postal services for parts of the city, you’re going to need to remain competitive. With a rival business looking to take a cut of the services there are methods of attack to remain the superior mail distribution business. You can carefully plan your delivery routes to make your average delivery time faster than anyone else, or you could lower the prices of your services to remain the cheapest.","tags":[268435469,268435488,536871906,536872060,536872406,536875046]},{"id":108083,"cover":{"id":94302,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co20ri.jpg"},"name":"Mars Power Industries","platforms":[{"id":39,"name":"iOS"},{"id":130,"name":"Nintendo Switch"}],"screenshots":[{"id":314739,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc6qur.jpg"},{"id":314740,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc6qus.jpg"},{"id":375678,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc81vi.jpg"},{"id":375679,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc81vj.jpg"}],"summary":"Congratulations on your first tiny colony!

The game differs from Monopoly in that players can buy and sell stocks of a block, affecting the value of block's stock up by buying or down by selling that block's stock or by developing a player-owned property of that block which increases the value per share for that block's stock. Also unlike Monopoly, it is not necessary to own the entire block to develop a property, though controlling more than one property of a block allows the player to develop their properties into larger buildings to collect more from opponents when they land on them. Players must collect a set of four suits, heart, diamond, clover and spade, to level up and collect additional gold when the pass the starting position/bank. To win a player must make it back to the bank with the board's required amount, which includes the total value of the player's stocks, property value, and gold on hand.","tags":[536871987,536872273,536873422,536873672]},{"id":93746,"aggregated_rating":78.0,"cover":{"id":86639,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co1uun.jpg"},"name":"Warriors Orochi 4","platforms":[{"id":6,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"},{"id":48,"name":"PlayStation 4"},{"id":49,"name":"Xbox One"},{"id":130,"name":"Nintendo Switch"}],"screenshots":[{"id":235103,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/q5sa2qi8ucq1ry2sbupd.jpg"},{"id":235104,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/qxzei0rxl7c1psidyvpw.jpg"},{"id":235105,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/qxz7rngy9oodzs6f7twm.jpg"},{"id":235106,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/owysgeodjysfgskedgw9.jpg"},{"id":235107,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/xrtexinpb8pdvftniumm.jpg"}],"summary":"WARRIORS OROCHI 4 stars heroes from the DYNASTY WARRIORS and SAMURAI WARRIORS series. 170 playable characters, new magic elements and an all new story enhance the latest entry in this exciting tactical action series.","tags":[1,22,39,268435468,268435480,268435481],"videos":[{"id":19730,"video_id":"wjOcGq-8EWA"},{"id":21660,"video_id":"jDr1mW_8exw"},{"id":21661,"video_id":"uuG67mUW-GY"},{"id":22285,"video_id":"_cmkRGR8WEc"},{"id":22286,"video_id":"yK7-lXZLFQA"},{"id":23462,"video_id":"_WxeX5lkt5Q"}]},{"id":22451,"aggregated_rating":70.0,"cover":{"id":136357,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co2x7p.jpg"},"name":"Fired Up","platforms":[{"id":38,"name":"PlayStation Portable"}],"screenshots":[{"id":430189,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc97xp.jpg"}],"summary":"Fired Up is a vehicular combat game available on the PlayStation Portable which supports up to eight players.
