In each of these trips the objective is to get the fairy (that is kept under Pac-man's hat) to Fairyland and also to return home to Pac-Man's house. The majority of the trip involves moving from left to right avoiding various obstacles such as the enemy ghosts, water spurts and quicksand traps. Each trip is divided into a number of rounds, the end of which provides Pac-Man with bonus points depending on how much time he has left and also his position in jumping at the end of each round. If the player runs out of time before finishing the round, Sue, the purple ghost, will speed up rapidly.\n\nThe penultimate round of a trip ends with Pac-Man entering Fairyland and returning the fairy under his hat to the Fairy Queen. In return the Fairy Queen gives Pac-Man magic boots. For the final round of the trip, Pac-Man has to travel from right to left back home. For assistance he uses the magic boots, which allow him to jump repeatedly while in mid-air. Once Pac-Man completes the trip, he is greeted by Ms. Pac-Man and Baby Pac-Man. In the US release of the game, Pac-Man's cat and dog in the cartoon series, Sour Puss and Chomp-Chomp, are also there to welcome Pac-Man home. Pac-Man then begins his next trip following the same objectives as before, although the difficulty increases.\n\nAs in the original Pac-Man, there are fruit which appear to eat for bonus points and power pellets to turn the ghosts blue and vulnerable. A hidden item (sometimes accidentally dropped by the ghosts) is a Flagship from Galaxian, which rewards 7650 points when collected (a reference to Namco's goroawase number of 765). The Galaxian Flagship is a long running cameo that appears in the Namco-made Pac-Man games. There are also hidden bonuses in the game, eating ghosts in a certain order will give extra time and pushing an obstacle in the opposite direction can give extra lives, invincibility, and balloons to collect for points and warps.","tags":[1,18,35,268435464,268435465,268435487,268435489,536870921,536871882,536872197,536872211,536873787,536878213],"videos":[{"id":2463,"video_id":"1SFeCzg7kfI"}]},{"id":134008,"cover":{"id":101875,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co26lv.jpg"},"name":"Infiniboss","platforms":[{"id":6,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}],"summary":"Infiniboss is an endless boss battle platformer.

Gameplay combines elements of a MMORPG—albeit in a simulated fashion as it is not an online game, though it does include limited multiplayer via ad hoc for up to four players—as well as elements of a dating sim. The game takes place in the same continuity as the prior game in the series, Sword Art Online: Infinity Moment, which exists in an alternate storyline from the Sword Art Online anime storyline. The player controls the main character Kirito, who has been trapped in a MMORPG where dying in the game will lead to his death in real life as well. Part of the game is actually a high definition recompilation of Sword Art Online: Infinity Moment, the original game in the series released for the PlayStation Portable, including all content of \"Floor Clearing\" from the previous game with the addition of new unexplored \"Hollow Area\" of Aincrad.","tags":[1,18,268435468,536871094,536871208,536871433,536871882,536871938,536872589,536875046,536875151,536875180,536875243,536877535,536877939,536879225,536880372,536880373],"videos":[{"id":5341,"video_id":"9Z29SnnIRaY"}]},{"id":53616,"cover":{"id":47901,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/s3tejoxvmt2gj12jgazw.jpg"},"name":"Skyraine","platforms":[{"id":6,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}],"screenshots":[{"id":122645,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/xqq6tcb2jkpe0evtarcb.jpg"},{"id":122646,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/wg9ji9jljtqx7jxlrijy.jpg"},{"id":122647,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/vqnyq7qnisqhaiqtjaca.jpg"},{"id":122648,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/hj9gnfak3qec5hut0rco.jpg"},{"id":122649,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/k8rkub3kvbyzpdaguqnv.jpg"}],"summary":"Skyraine is an action packed platform/missile defender game.

The player controls a small fighter ship that can move in eight directions and can fire both forward and backward. Each level consists of a number of green space stations that must all be destroyed to advance to the next level (a semi-transparent mini-map helps identify their location). Each station consists of six cannons arranged in a hexagon, surrounding a central core. The player must either destroy all six cannons or shoot the core to destroy a station, and in later levels the core is capable of defending itself.\nAdditionally, the player must avoid or destroy asteroids, mines, and a variety of enemy missiles and ships that attempt to collide with the player's ship. Enemies occasionally launch formation attacks — destroying the leader causes all remaining enemies to disperse, but destroying all enemies in a formation scores extra bonus points. A spy ship (worth a random bonus value) also appears occasionally, which must be destroyed or the enemies will go berserk.","tags":[1,18,268435461,268435489,536871078,536871113,536871859,536871882,536871937,536871970,536872651,536875046,536875258,536875262,536875942,536877141,536878192,536878610,536880077,536885038]},{"id":95142,"name":"Voyage Senki VR","platforms":[{"id":6,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}],"screenshots":[{"id":218291,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/bw3htk6tqufw4xnivpex.jpg"},{"id":218292,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/llbaxdmzt3ssdrxufmdc.jpg"},{"id":218293,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/rbj80ve7ln6q3j7rl2ou.jpg"},{"id":218294,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/spkr61rjyiumimchpeyn.jpg"},{"id":218295,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/jhfdycpwe6ptlbpwiiud.jpg"},{"id":218296,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/j3ezmemu2cga0e8zkgkv.jpg"},{"id":218297,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/boydwjpcjayybqeuulx5.jpg"},{"id":218298,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/ilqomclaevdxhyjqhe5w.jpg"},{"id":218299,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/nxkvnkukgjcfqvdpjbim.jpg"},{"id":218300,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/vxiaywcnfkykpckwr3ju.jpg"},{"id":218301,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/tnugtwg4xbtmn1xapwn6.jpg"},{"id":218302,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/qe9am18vilctjnxr4zr2.jpg"}],"summary":"Sailing in the blue ocean and exploring a new world is a dream in people's nature.

Each collected droplet gives 5 points; 45 points will get you to the next section; after three sections you will progress to the next increasingly harder level. \nMissing too many droplets will cause the beer glass to slip. Watch out for falling sugar cubes, peanuts, matchsticks and darts - you can only withstand them three times. Also beware of a little green caterpillar who tries to hinder your progress in all manners possible. Help comes in the form of a bell announcing 'happy hour'-mode - making your beer glass invulnerable for a couple of seconds. Another help is a sponge appearing from time to time. Jumping on it cleans all spilled droplets. \nUsers were encouraged to save their highscores on a blank disk and send them, accompanied with a slogan, to Dommelsch.
