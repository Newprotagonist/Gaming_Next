The developers in fact insist that if you are able to drive well, your lap times for the different circuits should be very similar to the real ones from the 1999 season.

It entered development at Ritual Entertainment in 2004, with consultancy from Crystal Dynamics, but production ended for unknown reasons after three to six months of work. The project was never officially announced by publisher Eidos Interactive, but its existence has been acknowledged by Crystal Dynamics\u0027 Chris Bruno and Daniel Cabuco, and by several artists formerly employed at Ritual Entertainment.\n\nEvidence of Legacy of Kain: The Dark Prophecy\u0027s development was largely publicized by Legacy of Kain fan and community member, Divine Shadow, between 2008 and 2012, in the form of screenshots of Malek\u0027s Bastion in the Legacy of Kain: Defiance engine, and concept art of the pre-banishment Hylden. Kain was to feature as the main character in the game, much of which would take place in the Demon Realm, and would further the storyline surrounding the Hylden, the Hylden Lord, and Janos Audron. Targeted platforms included the PlayStation 2, Xbox, and Microsoft Windows.",

Along the way, she will also discover her own destiny, and the mystery surrounding her new friend. \n \nSimply put, you have limited control of the dragon for most of the game, as your trigger finger will be shooting non-stop at the enemies that fly around the area. Orta will be your main source of fire-power when you simply press the fire button, but by pressing and holding, the aim cursor will change, allowing you to fire a burst of power from the dragon at whatever the cursor aims at. \n \nThe dragon itself can change into three forms at a press of a button. Each form has a different style of attack and power ability. \n \nA port of the original Panzer Dragoon is included.",

One day, Jim filled all of his balloons and tied them together to make a beautiful balloon rainbow across the sky. But suddenly, a strong wind came and carried Jim away. As Alice, you must save your brother from peril. Float through eight different stages as you follow Jim\u0027s trail of balloons. Collect as many balloons as possible to earn bonuses. Test your piloting skills to avoid enemies, or let go of your balloons to face enemies on the ground. In \"Balloon Trip\" mode, compete for the highest score and move up the ranks. Take a big gulp of courage and give Alice a hand as she searches for her missing brother.",

As in the original game, River City Ransom for the Game Boy Advance blends action, fighting, and role-playing elements into one game. You\u0027ll play one of two young heroes who must battle their way past city gangs and then defeat the gang lord to free the students of River City High. More than just a side-scrolling fighting game, River City Ransom EX features a character-building system and customization options.\n\nThe Western version is a regional port of the Japanese version, since it uses the same storyline and identities of River City Ransom, instead of the stablished characters from Downtown Nekketsu Story and the Kunio-kun franchise.",

Cheating his way through the Starfleet Aptitude Test, Roger is finally given the rank of captain, his own ship (a garbage scow) and a mission: to explore strange new worlds (which no man in his right mind would explore), to seek out new life and new civilizations (which grew out of the massive amounts of trash Roger will collect on his way), to boldly go where no man has gone before. Step by step Roger will have to unveil a galaxy-wide biohazardous material dumping scheme, solve the mystery of the disappearance of a fellow Starfleet captain and his ship, and confront an agent of an old nemesis.",

During adventure parts, players will become Ichika Orimura and enjoy the academy life together with the heroines. By choosing the options that appear mid-conversation, Ichika’s \"Braveheart Points\", which signify his manhood, will fluctuate. Depending on its final value, the game’s ending will change. In communication mode, it’s possible to give the game’s heroines a massage in order to deepen your bonds. If successful, your Braveheart Points will go up. But if it fails, they will fall. Massage techniques include applying pressure to parts of the body with your finger, tapping the body part, lightly rubbing it, or simply asking where she would like to be massaged.",

To help boost sales, Square Enix decided to release the game with a bonus DVD in the United States containing the second and third episodes of Season 2 (episodes 27 Teacher and 28 One is all, All is One\") of the 2003 anime series, since the show took a 4 month break in its Adult Swim broadcast. This DVD contains only English audio, with the shortened version of the 2nd OP \"READY STEADY GO\" by L\u0027Arc~en~Ciel and the shortened 3rd ED \"Motherland\" by Crystal Kay, since that is the version that was to be shown in the Adult Swim broadcast. As of August 31, 2005, the game has sold 160 thousand units in Japan.",

Human civilization has been devastated by a malevolent force known only as the Darkness and only the last remnants of humanity remain. Playing the role of Locke, a young adventurer determined to save his people, you\u0027ll discover a world where your choices have consequences and every victory comes with a price. Can you discover the origin of the Darkness and stop it once and for all, or will you succumb to its influence, dooming Legionwood to destruction.\n\nHeroes of Legionwood consists of two separate halves, Age of Darkness and Resurrection. Either installment can be played on its own, but the two will combine to form one epic adventure.",

It was originally released in 1991 for the NEC PC-9801, ported 1992 to the Super Famicom and 1994 to the Sega Mega Drive. During 1997, Lord Monarch was remade for Windows as Lord Monarch Online and released for free in both Japanese, and for the first time, English.\n\nThe Super Famicom version additional themes in addition to the medieval Europe theme. There is a futuristic theme with robots, a fast food theme with French fries and soft drinks attacking health food, a Three Kingdoms era theme, and a fairy-tale theme. The game is automatically paused until someone presses the Start button, so there is unlimited time for making alliances in the Super Famicom version—until the start button is pressed.\n\nThe Super Famicom version of Lord Monarch was one of the few games to support the Super Famicom mouse.\n\nA later version of the game was broadcast exclusively for Japanese markets via the Super Famicom\u0027s Satellaview subunit under the name BS Lord Monarch and was view-limited.",

Upon successfully completing a level, the player is graded on the reaction time. Different difficulty levels can be selected. In Normal Mode, pop-up icons and audio tones signal when to turn left or right, brake, hit turbo, or hit other cars. In Hard Mode, there are no on-screen icons to guide the player.\n\nThe Snes version is a unofficial port that star releasing beta versions on 2011. However, the game does not run on a stock SNES. It relies heavily on the MSU1 Media Enhancement Chip, a somewhat new chip which allows 4GB of additional storage space, full motion video playback and stereo PCM audio",

Innovative in gameplay, the game was very popular for many years.\n\nIn the game, the player assumes the role of a spy who infiltrates a building filled with elevators. He must collect secret documents from the building and traverse the 30 floors of the building using an increasingly complex series of elevators. The player is pursued by enemy agents who appear from behind closed doors. These agents must be dealt with via force or evasion. Successful completion of a level involves collecting all the secret documents and traversing the building from top to bottom. In the lower floors of the building, the elevator systems are so complex that some puzzle-solving skills are needed.\n\nThe game was available as a standard upright cabinet The controls consist of a 4-way joystick and two buttons, one for \"shoot\" and the other for jumping and kicking. The maximum number of players is two, alternating turns. The graphics are extremely simple, 2D color graphics and in-game music was composed by musician Yoshio Imamura. The game was followed by a sequel, Elevator Action II (also known as Elevator Action Returns).",

He left behind a huge bell - The Golden Voice - for his people to call him should they ever be in danger. During his absence however, the evil Lord Vetch invades the planet and enslaves Athellion\u0027s people by infecting them with a deadly virus. A virus, that requires a constant treatment with an antidote called catana. As the only one controlling the catana-support, Lord Vetch was easily able to force everyone to work for him. In order to prevent Athelion\u0027s return he has hidden The Golden Voice and soon it was forgotten along with the king\u0027s promise. Forgotten until Haven, one of the slaves, starts having dreams about a hill and a bell; dreams whose meaning he does not understand. When the news of the Haven\u0027s dreams reach Lord Vetch, he orders to murder him. Haven manages to escape and eventually learns about the real meaning of his dreams and is determined to find The Golden Voice and put an end to Lord Vetch\u0027 reign. \n \nHaven is a fast-paced, action-packed platformer but it also incorporates elements of several other genres. Haven can pick up many different weapons and parts of the game play more like a Shoot\u0027Em Up than a platformer. There are also several vehicles to control, ranging from speedboats and jetcars to gliders ,spaceships and jetpacks. Despite all these action elements, there are also some slower paced levels, which put more emphasize on puzzle-solving and exploration. \n \nHaven\u0027s conceptual artwork was done by Rodney Matthews, a fairly well-known English sci-fi/fantasy artist, which is evident in Haven\u0027s surrealistic, bizarre design.",

The two games are very similar sharing the same physics engine and graphics, although Strike Force featured more locations as well as left-handed, and reverse-hook bowlers. LAB Rats assisted in the development of Brunswick Circuit Pro Bowling so the game has the same physics engine, but has a more fantasy-oriented theme. Strike Force features 14 places to Bowl (12 in Fast Lanes) and 8 Playable characters. There are only 7 locations, but each has its own \"nighttime\" variant which is unlocked as a secret stage. It also features Golf Mode, Challenge Mode, Skins, and Tournaments. There are also 14 different bowling balls to use, such as the Lightning, and level specific ones like the Bone Crasher and Pharaoh\u0027s Magic.",

To make matters worse, he falls into some sort of love triangle with two beautiful girls, leaving his fate up in the air.\n\nUnlike other dating simulations, where your goal is to get girls to fall in love with you, in Death Match Love Comedy, you’ll be doing everything you can to avoid just that, as you try to figure out the reason behind the love-fueled explosions.\n\nAdditionally, there will be another mysterious phenomenon, such as angels, a friend who has some sort of prediction, weird dreams and whispers, and a strange pink cat-like creature.",

It also included a team creator mode, which enabled the player to make up to 128 custom teams. Barry Davies was joined by Trevor Brooking on the commentary, and the game featured England football team captain and striker Alan Shearer not only on the cover, but also providing interviews about the game in the press. Michael Owen and Simon Tracey provided motion capture for the players. The game also featured menu music and a cameo appearance from Welsh rockers, Super Furry Animals, which could only be activated after entering a cheat code. Actua Soccer 2 was also bundled with Creative Technology\u0027s Voodoo 2 graphic cards, which helped to achieve widespread distribution and popularity.",

    "summary": "When her father fell sick, Asagi Haru has to help support her family. She quits her job at the factory and starts looking for a new job. That’s when she bumpes into Egawa Chitomi and Arita Kisuke, who are looking for a new maid for the Miyanomori family. Haru applied for the job on the spot, leaving her hometown to work in their mansion in Tokyo. She thought working as a maid would be fun.. until she meets the six Miyanomori brothers.\n\nThe brothers each have different mothers, all divorced from their father — the head of the family, Miyanomori Genichirou. Being born in a big family, most of the brothers treat Haru like crap. They call her trash and view her as a lowly servant who doesn’t have any right to talk back to them. Not to mention Tae, her new tsundere friend there, keeps lying and gets her in trouble. Haru quickly realized that her new job isn’t by any means easy, but she needs to work hard for her family.\n\nNot too long after Haru starts working there, Genichirou announced to his sons that he’s retiring soon and he’s making a game to determine who will be the next head. The brothers have to entertain him and collect points. The first one who reached ten points will be the new head, and they have until March to please their father. This is the reason why the brothers all have different mothers: Genichirou wants to put them into a battle for the position.",

Bill Rizer, the hero of the Alien Wars, was held responsible for the incident, as well as for murdering his partner, Lance Bean, who reportedly tried to stop him.

The ruling government, referred to as the \"Triumvirate\", decides to release Bill Rizer prior to completing his sentence, in view of his previous successes in defending Earth, in hope of neutralizing Blood Falcon. Lucia, an advanced cyborg soldier built by the government from Dr. Geo Mandrake\u0027s research, is sent to accompany and assist Bill\u0027s endeavors. Bill eventually finds out that Lance is still alive and is in fact the commander of Blood Falcon himself.\n\nAfter defeating Lance, it is revealed that the aliens from the past games attacked because the Triumvirate secretly stole a mysterious, powerful \"Relic\" from them. With this information, Bill and Lucia have to confront Triumvirate and uncover the secret of the alien Relic.",

    "summary": "NOTE: This is the original 4-Player Arcade release, not the NES Title.\n\nThe player chooses from one of the four Ninja Turtles: Leonardo, Michelangelo, Donatello, and Raphael. After Shredder kidnaps the Turtles\u0027 friend April O\u0027Neil and their mentor Splinter, they must give chase, save their comrades, and defeat the evil Shredder.\n\nThe player chooses from one of the four Ninja Turtles: Leonardo, Michelangelo, Donatello, and Raphael. Depending on the version of the game, the characters are either, chosen at the start of the game or assigned by control panel. After Shredder kidnaps the Turtles\u0027 friend April O\u0027Neil and their mentor Splinter, they must give chase, save their comrades, and defeat the evil Shredder. Up to four players (two in some versions) can take control of any of the Turtles. Donatello has slower attacks but a longer range, Michelangelo and Raphael have faster attacks but a shorter range, and Leonardo is a well-rounded Turtle with average range and speed.\n\nThe eight-way joystick controls the movements of the Turtle, the jump button makes them jump and the attack button makes them hit in front of them using their weapon. In addition to this, some combinations are possible. The Turtles can throw Foot soldiers overhead, and by pressing the jump and attack buttons, a special attack is performed. Raphael rolls along the ground and finishes with a kick, while the other Turtles do a sweeping jump attack with their weapons. Turtles can also spring off the wall in certain areas. Enemies can be defeated more quickly by slamming them into walls or solid objects. Many objects such as traffic cones, parking meters, fire hydrants and exploding oil drums can be hit or damaged with attacks in order to help defeat nearby enemies. In the attract mode, the game showed the first part of the cartoon opening, along with a portion of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles theme song.\n\nMost of the enemies the Turtles face are the Foot Soldiers, all color-coded to indicate their attack patterns and weapon of choices. Some enemies, such as the standard purple-clad Foot Soldiers and Roadkill Rodney robots, have the ability to restrain the Turtles\u0027 mobility and drain their health, leaving the player open to attack for other enemies. The bosses in the game include Rocksteady and Bebop (individually at first in that order, and later the two of them together), Baxter Stockman, Granitor, General Traag, Krang, and Shredder himself.",

    "summary": "A new Gear arises, its name Leopaldon. As they threaten to lay waste to the world, you prepare to mount your offense. The good news? You won\u0027t have to face them alone.\n \nGuilty Gear Isuka introduces the brand new mechanic of cooperative gameplay to the tried and true fighting madness of the Guilty Gear XX series. With support for up to four local players (either on teams or as lone wolves), Guilty Gear has never seen more hectic action.Key FeaturesA Cast of Misfits - The colorful characters of Guilty Gear XX #Reload return for an encore, and are joined by newcomers A.B.A and Robo-Ky Mk. II! On top of the 23 characters available by default, who knows if there are even more waiting to be uncovered...\nBeat-Em-Up Action - Isuka goes from fighter to brawler when you dive into GG Boost Mode. Punch/kick/cut/grapple your way through waves of formidable opponents, and feel free to invite a friend to help; two-player co-op can give you that extra edge you need.\nMake an Abomination - Newcomer Robo-Ky Mk. II can be retrofitted with the moves of other characters, making him the ultimate doppelganger. Brutal command grabs, a projectile or two, almost nothing is verboten when it comes to the murderous art of imitation.\nBeautiful Characters and Environments - From the tiniest bounty hunter to the largest brute, from sunny beaches to moonlit cemetaries, Guilty Gear Isuka\u0027s sprite art oozes character.\nJaw-Dropping Heavy Metal Soundtrack - From the mind and frets of Guilty Gear creator Daisuke Ishiwatari comes some of the most intense rock you\u0027ll ever roman cancel to. Buyers of Guilty Gear Isuka on Steam will receive a digital copy of the Official Soundtrack for free!",

    "summary": "Sudden Strike is a real-time tactics (RTT) computer game set in World War II and the first game in the Sudden Strike series. The game was developed by Fireglow based in Russia and published by CDV software of Germany. The player selects a faction (e.g. Soviets, Germans, or Allied forces) and gains control of many varied units such as infantry, tanks and artillery. The games focus primarily on tactics, eschewing traditional real-time strategy resource gathering and base development.\n\n\nGAMEPLAY:\nThe main story features three campaigns (Soviets, Germans, and Allied forces). The battles are presented in an isometric perspective with line-of-sight occlusions and practical cover. Sudden Strike helped pioneer the real-time tactics genre, building upon concepts established by Counter Action for DOS, which was published by Mindscape in 1996.\n\nSudden Strike utilizes accurate in-game physics with houses and buildings obstructing units\u0027 view, line-of-sight and firing range whereas clumps of trees can provide cover to reduce the damage of tank ordnance. The game allows units to garrison a building for a stronger firing position, especially valuable for anti-tank infantry. Units can also hold their fire, providing much-needed reconnaissance. Damage evaluation is also realistic; tanks or other vehicles that take too much damage are rendered immobile unless repairs are made.\n\n\nSUDDEN STRIKE FOREVER:\nSudden Strike Forever was an official add-on to Sudden Strike which introduces many more historically correct units and equipment, such as the upgraded Soviet T-34 tank (1944 version). New terrains are also provided: a desert terrain for the British missions in Tobruk and Tripoli and snow terrains for Soviet missions. The expansion also polished the game engine, balanced the damage of certain units, and added a map and scenario editor.\n\nThe add-on includes 4 inter-linked scenarios for each of the campaigns for the Germans, the American, the British and the Soviets. Other units which are added into the add-on includes, but not limited to the Universal Carrier for the British; the BR-5 artillery, 160mm grenade launcher for the Soviet forces and more. The supply system has also been tweaked with artillery crews automatically resupplying themselves with ammo crates nearby instead of relying on supply trucks to do the job. The supply trucks would still be needed to repair damages inflicted on these artillery units, however.\n\nThe German campaign puts the player into the winter setting of Russian hinterlands with limited troops and reinforcements available, thus relying on use of captured Soviet artillery as well as equipment. The British campaign deals with the defense of an unnamed seaport from German attacks, whereas the American campaign probably takes place in France during the autumn season as the foliage on the vegetation suggest. The Soviet campaign involves a large armored division counter-attack on Russian soil and the storming of the Wehrmacht-controlled airfields. As with the earlier Sudden Strike original campaigns, the briefings do not explain the historical setting of the campaign, thus only issuing standardized orders to the player to e.g. dispel enemy attacks or to simply take over a designated airfield in the east and so on. The add-on also includes 5 new single player individual scenarios.\n\n\nRECEPTION:\nAs indicated by the cover art the game was regarded as \"The Best Real-time Strategy Game of the Year\" and generally received positive reviews.Sudden Strike holds a 69 Metascore based on 16 critics and an 8.2 user score based on 15 ratings on Metacritic. Sudden Strike Forever holds a 70 Metascore from 5 critics and an 8.8 User Score based on 46 ratings.",

    "summary": "The Devil Inside is a horror-themed third-person shooter video game developed by Gamesquad and published by Cryo Interactive for the PC Windows in 2000.\n\nGAMEPLAY:\nThe Devil Inside is presented as a reality television game show documenting the supernatural exploits of the protagonist Dave and his titular alter ego, a succubus named Deva. The player can transform between Dave and Deva by activating pentagrams located at certain places throughout the game\u0027s levels. During gameplay, Dave/Deva is followed by a small flying camera as well as a cameraman, and the player can switch between the two camera views as desired. Occasionally, a news helicopter will also be present and scripted cutscenes will be viewed from an aerial perspective.\n\nThe pacing, exploration, and puzzle factor of the game is similar to that of other survival horror titles. As Dave, the player has access to a variety of guns, which are equipped with laser sights to assist the player in aiming. As Deva, the player uses spells to attack enemies. Spells do not require ammunition, but do deplete mana that regenerates slowly. Some enemies generate souls when killed, and Deva can inhale souls to replenish her mana. Deva also has the ability to fly and regenerate health when standing in fire. The game uses a checkpoint save system represented by television sets found in-game.\n\nDEVELOPMENT:\nThe game\u0027s script was written by Hubert Chardot, better known for his work in the Alone in the Dark series. Its theme is similar to The Running Man, written by Stephen King, whose name is mentioned early in the game.\n\nRECEPTION:\nGameSpot\u0027s Greg Kasavin awarded the game a 6.8 out of 10, citing difficulties with the control scheme. In regards to the game\u0027s action sequences, Kasavin opined that \"some of the battles are scripted very well. But other times, the combat is poor.\" The environments of the game were praised for their realism and atmosphere, while character models and sound effects were rated as plain. Overall, the game was described as competent but lacking polish. PC Gamer US gave the game a score of 79% in their January 2001 issue. The review praised the animations, camera angles, the use of a dual character, and the game\u0027s low learning curve. However, the review cited \"poor polygonal figures and texturing\", and some environmental bugs as the low points of the game.\n\nIn Poland, it was one of the first of the series of cheap premiere releases in the ExtraGra magazine. Shortly after the game\u0027s release, one of Poland\u0027s most popular TV stations, TVN aired a report on the game, accusing the distributor, CD Projekt of selling satanic games in commonly accessible kiosks. The epilepsy warning, which by the time was already common among video games released in Poland and almost omnipresent in Europe, was used as an example of the game\u0027s exceptionally negative impact on young people.",

The ultimate goal is to lead your character through the path from beginning to end, while learning how a variety of different objects can be combined with perspectives, angles and the use of light can be used to help solve the puzzle. Beware … much like echochrome, the possibilities are infinite and there is always more than meets the eye as every person can view each puzzle differently!",

The pair find out that it\u0027s an alien, and that Edo\u0027s being invaded!\n\nThis is the first Goemon game since Sasuke and Yae\u0027s appearance as playable characters that doesn\u0027t include either on the playable roster. Instead, they are replaced by the new characters Goroku and Baban. Although Sasuke and Yae are playable characters again in most future games and Goroku and Baban are never seen, mentioned or heard from again after this game. Its unknown why they never appear again, but it is assumed that many fans were upset over Sasuke and Yae being replaced.\n\nGameplay is rather similar to Ganbare Goemon 3, as there\u0027s a main map in top-down perspective, which leads to various 2-D sidescrolling levels.",

With the powers of a god, you are unleashed upon the universe to begin forging your galactic empire in the stars. From dust to the cosmos beyond, your civilization will rise through the ages under your guidance. Yet this is not the same static world you may be accustomed to, this is a dynamic, living world that is just as unpredictable as it is beautiful. Everything in The Universim revolves around dynamic gameplay, including the civilization AI. You may have unparalleled power, but you cannot control the AI directly as you would in a typical strategy game. The AI will make its own decisions and always seek to better the civilization in some way, but at times their decisions may end badly without your intervention.",

    "summary": "This game is the fourth game in the series of parody shooters produced by Konami and was released only in Japan. The gameplay is stylistically very similar to the Gradius series, but the graphics and music are intentionally absurd. The game, as its name would suggest (translated: \"Chatting Parodius Live\"), contains a large amount of Japanese voice samples shouted out in a style similar to that of a game show host.\n\nUnlike the previous titles, this game was not created originally as an Arcade game. Instead, it was originally released on the japanese Super Famicom and this port is an upgraded version of that one, featuring not only improved graphics and sound from the Super Famicom game, but some altered levels and bosses, including a cheat to replace \"Tokimeki People\u0027s Dance\" with an enhanced version, \"Days Of The Dream\u0027s Memories\". Also added were several \"Omake\" stages and an unlockable Dracula-kun and Kid Dracula as a playable character. In a two-player game, both players can now choose to play simultaneously instead of just alternately in the Super Famicom game.\n\nThis game was also released on the Sony PlayStation with little differences compared to this version.",

    "summary": "In development since 2010, the 18th Cacoward winner and Moddb 2012 MOTY Editors Choice of Creativity Award Brütal Doom takes Doom into a whole new level. It makes the game much more violent than before. There\u0027s much more blood, plus it adds unique gibs, death animations, dismemberments, headshots, executions, fire and explosion particles, flares, and much more.\n\nThe whole world becomes more real and interactive.You can kick severed limbs and heads (and sometimes, use it to activate some traps in the map earlier, or even kick them against enemies to do some damage), you can shoot enemies\u0027 heads to deal more damage (and cause more gruesome deaths) you can destroy most things in the the scenario (trees, lamps, hanging bodies, etc), you can paint the floor, the walls, and even the ceiling with blood, you can push the explosive barrels to make traps, or grab them and use like an explosive weapon, you can silently take down enemies from behind and perform stealth kills, the chainsaw actually cuts the enemies in two. When you find the berserk pack and get super strength, you can perform cinematic executions and RIP AND TEAR your foes with your bare hands. Some enemies will scream in anguish and try to crawl away when near death, and they can be used as human shields, and much, much more.\n\nEverything in Brutal Doom is extremely intense. Everything sounds louder, looks bigger, moves faster, and hits harder. You can even fell the impact of explosions. Enemies are harder and smarter, and weapons and explosions are much louder. Your weapons have been upgraded to a deadly arsenal, completely throwing the vanilla Doom\u0027s \"progressive weapon system\" through the window. Every weapon is powerful and have it\u0027s pros and cons, a a weapon will never be outclassed when you find a new weapon, but only find a different use for different situations, making Brutal Doom more balanced and more strategic than Vanilla gameplay. You have new abilities too. With any weapon selected, you can press Q (default bind) to kick enemies at close range and send them away. Every new feature and weapon is cautiously balanced, and added in a way that makes sense in the universe of Doom. Many of the features can also be disabled/enabled to provide the best personal experience possible.\n\nBrütal Doom will make the good an old Doom have a new and fresh look. It will give you a reason to play all the Ultimate Doom, Doom 2, and Final Doom levels again. This mod also works with almost every megawad and map pack around. Take a breath, and prepare to RIP AND TEAR HUGE GUTS!!!!!",

    "summary": "Colossal Cave Adventure (also known as ADVENT, Colossal Cave, or Adventure) is a text adventure game, developed originally in 1976, by Will Crowther for the PDP-10 mainframe. The game was expanded upon in 1977, with help from Don Woods, and other programmers created variations on the game and ports to other systems in the following years.\n\nIn the game, the player controls a character through simple text commands to explore a cave rumored to be filled with wealth. Players earn predetermined points for acquiring treasure and escaping the cave alive, with the goal to earn the maximum amount of points offered. The concept bore out from Crowther\u0027s background as a caving enthusiast, with the game\u0027s cave structured loosely around the Mammoth Cave system in Kentucky.\n\nColossal Cave Adventure is the first known work of interactive fiction and, as the first text adventure game, is considered the precursor for the adventure game genre. Colossal Cave Adventure also contributed towards the role playing and roguelike genres.",

    "summary": "Win the daily battle with the clock—become a bus driver!\n\nSix true-to-life city buses, including two Lion’s City buses licensed by MAN, and a gigantic freely accessible world are waiting for you in Bus Simulator 16. Transport your passengers to their destinations across five authentic city districts safely and on time. Drive a two-door, three-door, or a true-to-life articulated bus through commuter traffic at rush hour, watch out for emergency vehicles, and take detours around construction sites. But watch out, or you will get into trouble for accidents and traffic violations!\n\nYou also have to maintain order inside the bus. Calm upset passengers, repair stuck doors, sell tickets correctly, and extend the ramp for wheel chair passengers in a timely manner. You will have to be efficient if you want to stick to your schedule, as it is only by doing this that you will build up your reputation in the city, earn the trust of your passengers, and most importantly, make money! The better your reputation, the larger the contracts you can secure, and the more buses will be available to your company in the shop. Unlock additional districts of the city and carefully plan routes for the employees you will acquire in the included job exchange.\n\nAs you grow more successful, you will also acquire more and more advertising banners for your buses, which bring in additional money. If your buses are too dull, you can paint and decorate them with unlockable decals, ensuring that your passengers reach their destinations in the coolest way possible.\n\nYou think bus drivers are lonely? Not in Bus Simulator 16! Invite your friends into your game in multiplayer mode and let them take over routes for you. The money they earn can be used to expand your shared company and thus perfect public transportation in your city.\n\nYou want to drive even more buses and arrange Sunny Springs to fit your expectations? Then you can just construct the city to suit your own taste. Bus Simulator 16 is mod-friendly, and you can use programs like Blender and Gimp to adjust the visual appearance of the existing buses to your liking, as well as integrate your own custom buses and buildings into the game.",

The game featured an open world, and combined cinematic, violent combat with dungeon crawls, puzzles, and boss encounters. Links to past Legacy of Kain entries figured into the design, such as the shifting mechanic of the Soul Reaver titles, which enabled players to alternate between two planes of existence.",

A special military unit called the Special Intervention Forces has but a single mission- to do away with all terrorist organizations and other menacing threats. The latest threat has to do with the fact that the enemy has in their possession a biochemical weapon that alters human DNA. They have used this chemical to strengthen hostility and athletic genes to produce an original species of insurgent. The Counter Terrorist Special Intervention Forces are the only ones who possess the strength and skill to crush this new adversary. Each player is responsible for controlling his or her member of the CT Special Forces, as each mission becomes increasingly difficult. In the latest threat of terrorism, the need for underwater soldiers has become a necessity. With scuba diving skills, the player can explore several underwater regions. Combat takes place in both the water and on land, so the game presents the player with a number of vehicle and weaponry options. Each skill is the most sophisticated available and designed to seek out and destroy the enemy. The game takes the player through 20 levels that test, challenge and drive the Special Forces towards victory. Fans of combat action games with a patriotic tone must try this intense game.",

    "summary": "Ruff Night At The Gallery is an adorable short-form horror game where you explore an art gallery. Alone.  At night. Sound scary? Don’t worry, the paintings are of cute dogs! But maybe DO worry because they’re also haunted… \n \nCollect the keys to make it through each exhibit, but make sure to keep an eye on the artwork: the paintings like to move around. Ghost dogs will also pop off their canvases when you’re not looking to give you a big ol’ lick. \n \nThese dogs ain’t your grandpa’s poker playing kitsch - they’re works from the greats, from renaissance classics like “Pup With A Tasty Bone” and Paw Vinci’s “The Doggo Lisa” to modern masterpieces like “American Dogthic”, “The Howl”, Pawcasso’s “Pup Before A Mirror” - this gallery has something for everyone! (except cats)",
