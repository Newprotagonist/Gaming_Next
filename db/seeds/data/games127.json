Since then Savage: The Battle for Newerth has been continuously improved by the Savage community: from 2004 to 2005 by the EX2 team, from 2005 to 2007 by the SEP/SFE team and since 2008 by the Savage XR team.\n\nAlthough the game has been criticized for being released in an unpolished state, lacking basic features and any kind of tutorials, Savage: The Battle for Newerth with its innovative RTS/FPS gameplay was far ahead of its time, winning awards such as the Seumas McNally Grand Prize, Technical Excellence and the Audience Award at the Independent Games Festival 2004 or the Editor\u0027s Choice Award \"8.7 - Great\" by IGN.com.",

Posing with hands over 2 of the targets, or holding one position until a trail of beat balls is complete, may also be required from the player.\nChuChu Rocket! – Movement over a certain target on the screen will cause a bridge to raise, which the chu-chus then follow to the goal. The bridge also must be dropped at certain moments to prevent KapuKapus from destroying the score.\nPuyo Pop Fever – Differently colored puyos will fall from the top of the screen, and the player\u0027s body must be positioned to guide them into the corresponding pots and allow bombs to topple off the bottom of the screen.\nCrazy Taxi – Large movements and loud sounds must be undertaken to stop the Crazy Taxi and complete the level.\nSuper Monkey Ball – The player must move their arms into different positions in order to guide the monkey ball around obstacles and towards the goal, picking up as many bananas as possible along the way.\nNiGHTS Into Dreams – NiGHTS must be controlled and navigated through rings, collecting chips along the way, by raising your arms into a \u0027flying\u0027 position and adjusting them along the way.\nHouse of the Dead – A multitude of different zombies must be attacked and defeated by hitting them. Innocent people who occasionally appear must also be avoided.\nVirtua Striker – As footballs drop from the top of the screen, the aim is to head them into differently colored and scored balloons on the opposite side of the screen in order to obtain the highest score.\nVirtua Fighter – Standing to one side, players kick and punch the corresponding attack prompts on the screen in order to defeat the opponent. Block and counter prompts also appear, and must be reacted to accordingly.\nSpace Channel 5 – Different dance move combination must be remembered when shown by the Morolians, and then repeated in time to the music by hitting six different buttons on the screen.\nBilly Hatcher and the Giant Egg – By waving their hands over two different targets, players must move Billy and the egg around, and crush enemies and collect fruits along the way to the goal.",

Typically, you start with a small ranch that can be extended by breeding herds and trading cattle. Indians, bandits and bounty hunters will be on the look-out, so you need to hire gunslingers in the saloons to protect your property. As the ranch grows into a small community, different buildings can be constructed: houses, cowboy quarters, sheds, storehouses... After a while, you can also build your own towns with banks, hotels, churches, railroads, saloons and a sheriff\u0027s office.",

Play begins when the player launches a ball with the plunger from first screen through the top of the screen to the second screen. Play will move to the first screen if the ball falls through the bottom of the top screen and will return to the top screen if the ball is hit back through the space at the top of the first screen. If the ball falls through the hole to the right bottom at the top level, the player will enter a mini-game featuring Mario and Lady. The player controls the paddles on either screen to deflect the ball to keep it from falling off the bottom of the lower screen.",

However, due to SNK\u0027s financial troubles and restructuring, the title was redesigned as a Capcom-only crossover with twenty former SNK members designing it, using the models previously built for the original title.\n\nLike SNK\u0027s KOF: Maximum Impact games, it was designed to translate a 2D fighting game series into 3D. This was done previously in the Street Fighter EX series, which Capcom co-produced with Arika.\n\nCapcom beta-tested the game, but after negative feedback from players and more months in development, the game was canceled in August 2003.\n\nAccording to an interview with former The King of Fighters director Toyohisa Tanabe, a secret character from Tanabe\u0027s old company (SNK) was set to be playable in Capcom Fighting All Stars.. While not confirmed, the figure bears a heavy resemblance to K\u0027 or Kyo Kusanagi.",

Dodgeball - Your aim is to avoid the balls but they are getting bigger and faster. You score points when your opponent hits a ball.\n\n3. Loneball - The classic Pong mode BUT with an 80\u0027s retro vibe including neon lighting and a chiptune soundtrack!\n\nYou can play against the AI or, for the most fun, challenge a friend and let the shouting commence!\n\nThe game was created in Unity and is currently in Early Access on Steam.",

You\u0027ll need to explore, hunt for supplies, uncover clues, and fight your way through each anomaly – each consisting of semi-procedurally generated instances where both the environment, and the undead, are out to kill you! Immediately after the events of Outbreak: The Nightmare Chronicles, you find yourself trapped within the remains of Arzt Memorial Hospital – the hub to organize your inventory and storage cache, level up your character, or just to take a breather before venturing back out into the chaos. There’s more to discover in the world besides murderous hordes of the undead – find the journals scattered about to learn more about the outbreak and ultimately where to find refuge! Don’t think death can save you – every time you die, you\u0027ll awake trapped in this nexus. Outbreak: Endless Nightmares focuses on extreme replayability by offering multiple character options – each with their own abilities, upgrade paths and more! Each time you venture into the anomaly, it’ll change and become increasingly difficult as you grow in power. You\u0027ll need to think carefully about what weapons, healing items, and other supplies you\u0027ll bring along. If you\u0027re lucky, you may find storage caches that give you access to your expanded inventory, and offer an opportunity to restock. But it\u0027s all on you to search your environment for supplies. If you run out ... your fate is sealed!",

The original fourth command has been replaced by the introduction of Reaction Commands from Kingdom Hearts II and are triggered by pressing the Triangle Button. The camera works more similarly to that of Kingdom Hearts II, utilizing the right thumb stick to move the camera and allowing the player to click the R3 button to reset the camera behind Sora, as opposed to the original game which made use of the shoulder triggers L2 and R2 to position the camera. Overall, the gameplay of Kingdom Hearts Final Mix was modified so it would play more similarly to Kingdom Hearts II and Re:Chain of Memories, to create a more consistent play style throughout the series.\n\nKINGDOM HEARTS: RE:CHAIN OF MEMORIES\nThis version of Chain of Memories was released in Europe and Australia for the first time as part of the collection, as it was previously released in North America in December 2008.\n\nKINGDOM HEARTS: 358/2 DAYS\nThis game, originally released for the Nintendo DS, does not appear in playable form in this collection, and is instead adapted into 2 hours and 50 minutes worth of cinematic cutscenes, remastered in high definition.",

    "summary": "Fable was expanded and rereleased as Fable: The Lost Chapters for Xbox and Windows PC platforms in September 2005. The game was later ported to Mac OS X by Robosoft Technologies and published by Feral Interactive on 31 March 2008.\nThe Lost Chapters features all the content found in the original Fable, as well as additional new content such as new monsters, weapons, alignment based spells, items, armour, towns, buildings, and expressions, as well as the ability to give children objects. The story receives further augmentation in the form of nine new areas and sixteen additional quests. Characters such as Briar Rose and Scythe, who played only minor roles in the original game, are now given more importance and are included in certain main and side quests. Other character-based augmentations include the voice of the antagonist, Jack of Blades, sounding deeper, harsher and more demonic, and the ability to uncover (and resolve) the murder mystery of Lady Grey\u0027s sister. The updated edition of the game also applied fixes for certain glitches, such as the \"dig glitch,\" in which the protagonist would move backward each time he used the shovel, pushing him through solid objects and sometimes trapping him.",

It\u0027s impossible to raise all four at once, so players must have a well defined strategy to succeed. \n \nDepending on their abilities, each horse might be better suited for a particular strategy or type of race, and each must be treated differently to achieve the best possible result. The game features a large roster of horses, and many tracks to choose from, including flat track and steeplechase races. Game modes include race training, a tutorial, two player mode, and the career mode, where the player starts as a rookie jockey, and must complete races and training sessions to attract the attention of better stables.",

    "summary": "Ghost Master is a strategy game with a difference. Your aim is to build up and control a team of ghosts, and your goal is to scare the humans.Set in the town of Gravenville, there are number of different scenarios to play, set over a variety of fully 3D environments including the country house, police station and hospital.Instead of playing with one single character, you build up an entire ghostly team. There are around 50 ghosts in total and each haunter has its own personality, strengths, and weaknesses. As the game develops the characters themselves will develop and grow. What\u0027s more, each one has its own unique set of powers - some can make the walls drip with blood while others can cut the lights in the room...Each time you scare a human or \u0027mortal\u0027, you will increase your plasm; the energy you need to scare them in the first place. Scare them too much and people will flee from the building, which will make your job more difficult.Ghost Master uses a unique AI engine, which gives the player a sense of natural human behaviour. The mortals will go about their everyday lives; cooking, going to work, arguing with each other... until they encounter the horrors you control! After facing these horrors they will become irrational, afraid, and sometimes even go insane! As well as horror the game also contains elements of humour.",

If the Heroes successfully complete all their side quests, they will face off against the Villains in one last epic clash.

    "summary": "Arkanoid - Revenge of Doh (a.k.a. Arkanoid 2) is an arcade game released by Taito in 1987 as a sequel to Arkanoid.\n\nThe mysterious enemy known as DOH has returned to seek vengeance on the Vaus space vessel. The player must once again take control of the Vaus (paddle) and overcome many challenges in order to destroy DOH once and for all. Revenge of Doh sees the player battle through 34 rounds, taken from a grand total of 64.\n\nNEW FEATURES:\nRevenge of Doh differs from its predecessor with the introduction of \"Warp Gates\". Upon completion of a level or when the Break (\"B\") pill is caught, two gates appear at the bottom of the play area, on either side. The player can choose to go through either one of the gates - the choice will affect which version of the next level is provided. The fire-button is only used when the Laser Cannons (\"L\") or Catch (\"C\") pill is caught.\n\nThe game also features two new features for bricks. Notched silver bricks, like normal silver bricks, take several hits to destroy. However, after a short period of time after destruction, they regenerate at full strength. Fortunately, clearing a level does not require that any notched bricks be destroyed. Also, some bricks move from side to side as long as their left and/or right sides are not obstructed by other bricks.\n\nThe US version features an entirely different layout for Level 1 that feature an entire line of notched bricks, with all colored bricks above it moving from side to side.\n\nThe game features a mini-boss in the form of a giant brain, which will help you practice for DOH.\n\nHome versions of Revenge of DOH also featured a level editor, where players could create their own levels or edit and replace existing levels, with the exception of two levels: the mini-boss and DOH.",

Along the way, Big Nose collects bones, that he can use to buy items from the various shops that include spells, upgrades to his abilities and items.\n\nThis game is also very difficult because you cannot restart from where you left off once all your lives are gone. It is also very long with four islands (Paradise Island, Monster Island, Terror Island, and Chaos Island) each containing several levels. Big Nose the Caveman dies in a single hit unless he has stones. The stones can shoot out of his club, killing enemies. As many as three stones can come out of the club. There are also many pitfalls, traps and deadly lava/water since Big Nose can\u0027t swim.\nIt was followed by a sequel in 1992.\n\nA Master System and Game Gear version called Dinobasher was completed, but never published.",

Using these catalysts, Student Transfer seeks to explore the themes of swapping bodies or minds, possessing other people and gender bending them (or yourself).\n\nThe story is told through the perspective of the main character, using a first person narrative while using a traditional text and sprite-based visual novel model.",

As hostilities died out, more trivial concerns like rebuilding what was lost or dealing with space piracy, became the biggest concerns of the Terran Confederation. Even Christopher \"Maverick\" Blair, the famous Confed pilot responsible for ending the war, settled down and became a farmer. In these times of peace, humans grew fat and complacent. All good things must end, though. Soon enough, heinous incidents erupted on the outskirts of the Confederation, and humanity was forced to the brink of civil war. Confed HQ needed the best and decided to recall Colonel Blair to active duty. This is where you come in.\n\nWing Commander 4 is one of the greatest space sims of all time, and some even consider it the greatest one of all. It is one of those games that did everything right. This is one of the few games that actually successfully manages to integrate a lot of FMV into the action, mostly because it uses trained film actors and directors. The combat is straightforward, fluid, and entertaining. The characters are as believable and memorable as they come. The orchestrated music -- just perfect. Finally, its enthralling story is both deep and plausible -- a combination that is often lost in modern games. There is simply no reason not to play this game and, once you do start playing, you will find it hard to think of a reason why you should stop.",
