They have 8 types of machinery, suitable for land, surface and airborne operations, as well as 17 types of weapon from assault rifles to the nuclear bomb.","tags":[1,27,268435461,268435471,536871262,536871546,536871937,536872070,536874694,536874743,536875046,536875151,536875492,536876569,536877511]},{"id":85059,"cover":{"id":61507,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/rghngh3krtk7vg9wwdqc.jpg"},"name":"Cue Sports: Snooker Vs Billiards","platforms":[{"id":5,"name":"Wii"}],"screenshots":[{"id":155799,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/f3fysgvircpfjdybq3kc.jpg"},{"id":155800,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/ybhzthqiksyhl7efghba.jpg"},{"id":155801,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/vyubsonhlakwuszenrxv.jpg"},{"id":155802,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/jpl5yiww5ypqoowz4jku.jpg"},{"id":155803,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/bmgo3v83lmmm7lmerqeu.jpg"},{"id":155804,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/wrz5fymxnockj3sqrwb2.jpg"},{"id":155805,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/xl5su8z5cevs7ml9mpsf.jpg"},{"id":155806,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/ns1kdbijbsisib75mhdx.jpg"},{"id":155807,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/hlvvo6mkndoeb5tl4w0r.jpg"},{"id":155808,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/ehqb7xr3gnohcdsmf1lb.jpg"},{"id":155809,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/zdrgpgliahlonybvvnla.jpg"},{"id":155810,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/nvgsgjiz0bsaaox50q2q.jpg"}],"summary":"Grab your Wii Remote controller and take a shot at this virtual billiard game."},{"id":52084,"cover":{"id":106110,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co29vi.jpg"},"name":"BAE","platforms":[{"id":6,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}],"screenshots":[{"id":113939,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/mx5pzyahqykgnnbfvvia.jpg"},{"id":113940,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/hv3jhhnegu5xhuyytwsz.jpg"},{"id":113941,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/dr2gxoz5avsmyulidpm0.jpg"},{"id":113942,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/an03vjfekwvevedjto7f.jpg"},{"id":113943,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/eg7bncfvveedetmpad9q.jpg"}],"summary":"BAE is a simple puzzle game in which your task is to destroy all green cubes, and do so all the white appeared on the platform.","tags":[268435469,268435488,536872060]},{"id":45103,"cover":{"id":205695,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co4epr.jpg"},"name":"CT Special Forces: Back to Hell","platforms":[{"id":7,"name":"PlayStation"}],"summary":"Intelligence agencies are mentioning an increase in terrorist activity in every nook and cranny of the planet.

Horse Racing (US) or horseracing (UK) is an equestrian sport that has been practiced for millennia. It is inextricably associated with gambling. The common sobriquet for Thoroughbred horse racing is The Sport of Kings. \n \nHorse racing is an equestrian sport and major international industry, watched in almost every nation of the world. There are three types: \"flat\" racing; steeplechasing, i.e. racing over jumps; and harness racing, where horses trot or pace while pulling a driver in a small, light cart known as a sulky. A major part of horse racing's economic importance lies in the gambling associated with it, an activity that in 2008 generated a world-wide market worth around US$115 billion. \n \nJapan conducts more than 21,000 horse races a year in one of three types: flat racing, jump racing (races over hurdles), and Ban'ei Racing (also called Draft Racing). \n \nThere are a total of thirty racetracks in Japan. Ten of these tracks are known as \"central tracks\", where most of Japan's top races are conducted. Races at these ten tracks are conducted by the Japan Racing Association (JRA), which operates under the oversight of the Japanese government. The remaining twenty tracks are operated by municipal racing authorities and run under the affiliation of the National Association of Racing (NAR). Two tracks, Sapporo Racecourse and Chukyo Racecourse, run separate meetings under either JRA or NAR jurisdiction. \n \nPower Stakes Grade 1 is the second game in Tose Software game series featuring the new data of the new season over the previous game. The game again features the 3d engine to watch the race in different camera angles that the player select in the game main menu.","tags":[268435466,268435469,536871535,536872736,536890805],"videos":[{"id":43075,"video_id":"z2-BBcAiyfo"},{"id":43076,"video_id":"HP3xeb9BNtg"}]},{"id":4338,"cover":{"id":140421,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co30cl.jpg"},"name":"DinoPark Tycoon","platforms":[{"id":6,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"},{"id":13,"name":"PC DOS"},{"id":14,"name":"Mac"},{"id":50,"name":"3DO Interactive Multiplayer"}],"screenshots":[{"id":16469,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/iy7gcupol9wmgbyiyrtz.jpg"}],"summary":"DynoPark tycoon is a Sim Park style game except it contains live dinosaurs.

As you charge up the PSI Circuit, target reticules appear on nearby enemies, the circle indicating they're in range, and the cross indicating you've charged up enough to damage or kill them. You can't just use the PSI Circuit as often as you want, though. After releasing it, there's a cooldown time before you can charge up again, and the longer you charge up, the longer you have to wait. Destroyed enemies leave behind PSI crystals you can use to upgrade three facets of your PSI Circuit- Circuit Charge (charge up faster), Circuit Refill (less cooldown time), and Reflect Shields. When you have at least one level in Shields, a barrier is projected around Merit, which will deflect one bullet per shield level, before having to regenerate. As you upgrade Shields, the barrier becomes bigger, then shows multiple layers as it gets stronger.","tags":[268435468,536871086,536872425]},{"id":148750,"cover":{"id":198325,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co4911.jpg"},"name":"Capcom Arcade Stadium: Final Fight","platforms":[{"id":6,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}],"screenshots":[{"id":461136,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc9vtc.jpg"},{"id":461138,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc9vte.jpg"},{"id":461141,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc9vth.jpg"},{"id":461143,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc9vtj.jpg"},{"id":461145,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc9vtl.jpg"},{"id":461148,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc9vto.jpg"}],"summary":"Add Final Fight to your Capcom Arcade Stadium game line-up!

Instead of stalking your target you immediately get into the hunt and start shooting. Choose a region on the in-game Hunting Map (such as Western, Central, Eastern, Southern, and Southwestern United States, and four Canadian provinces) and compete for the top seat on the in-game High Score leaderboard. Buck Fever supports the Wii Zapper accessory. \n• Multiplayer Party Mode: One to four players can join in on a hunt simultaneously. Buck Fever features two unique multiplayer “party” modes: Hunter’s Challenge and Bonus Games. In the Hunter’s Challenge one to four players compete within a time limit for the highest score. In six Bonus Games one to four players compete in a timed shoot-out with inanimate objects (such as bottles and cans) or animal targets such as gopher and duck. \n• Trophy Room: Buck Fever features a Trophy Room that, per player, shows off the diverse wildlife you’ve bagged in the game’s 70 hunts including, but not limited to, desert mule, blacktail, fallow, mule, and whitetail deer, and wild boar. The Trophy Room also displays how many bucks you have hunted, the number of one-shot kills you have earned, the biggest buck you’ve brought down, and the highest overall score achieved while playing the game.","tags":[268435461,268435469,268435470,536870976,536871044,536872060,536872696,536875420,536875483,536875558,536875610,536876911,536877537,536879233,536880949]},{"id":153904,"cover":{"id":168943,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co3mcv.jpg"},"name":"Blazing Aries","platforms":[{"id":6,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}],"screenshots":[{"id":505695,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scau73.jpg"},{"id":505699,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scau77.jpg"},{"id":505701,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scau79.jpg"},{"id":505702,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scau7a.jpg"},{"id":505704,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scau7c.jpg"}],"summary":"The game tells the story of a new adventurer named Aries.
