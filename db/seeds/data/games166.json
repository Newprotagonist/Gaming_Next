Two players can battle and trade items with the aid of the GBA link cable.","tags":[1,17,268435468,268435471,268435472,268435480,536871076,536871138,536871139,536871148,536871208,536871228,536871236,536871307,536871327,536871390,536871409,536871433,536871470,536871717,536871758,536871906,536871938,536872120,536872121,536872201,536872264,536872453,536872460,536872594,536872622,536872828,536872835,536872983,536873718,536874694,536874743,536875050,536875073,536875075,536875081,536875160,536875244,536875262,536875275,536875299,536875304,536875307,536875310,536875314,536875329,536875361,536875380,536875420,536875434,536875455,536875523,536875525,536875537,536875608,536875639,536875738,536875778,536875803,536875855,536875874,536875896,536875952,536876087,536876195,536876199,536876233,536876241,536876286,536876376,536876383,536876503,536876511,536876599,536876607,536876736,536876848,536876986,536877035,536877133,536877143,536877172,536877422,536877503,536877504,536877505,536877506,536877507,536877508,536877554,536877559,536877655,536877693,536877696,536877768,536877769,536877984,536878107,536878216,536878381,536878382,536878384,536878440,536878444,536878446,536878523,536878589,536878604,536879696,536879941,536879942,536879975,536880469,536880540,536880549,536880755,536880803,536880812,536881768,536881990,536882075,536882365,536882496,536882688,536882799,536882819,536882988,536883157,536883162,536883637,536883850,536883958,536883986,536884027,536885058,536885278,536885311,536885326,536885327,536885328,536885329,536885330,536885331,536885332,536885333,536885334,536885335,536885336,536885337,536885348,536885349,536885350,536885351,536885352,536885355,536885357,536885359,536885360,536885361,536885362,536885363,536885364,536885366,536885368,536885369,536885371,536885373,536885375,536885376,536885378,536885381,536885383,536886180],"videos":[{"id":32277,"video_id":"sLvY1zlPBCk"}]},{"id":117360,"name":"Deep Race: Space","platforms":[{"id":6,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}],"screenshots":[{"id":303689,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc6ibt.jpg"},{"id":303690,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc6ibu.jpg"},{"id":303691,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc6ibv.jpg"},{"id":303692,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc6ibw.jpg"},{"id":303693,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc6ibx.jpg"},{"id":303694,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc6iby.jpg"},{"id":303695,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc6ibz.jpg"},{"id":303696,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc6ic0.jpg"},{"id":303697,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc6ic1.jpg"},{"id":303698,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc6ic2.jpg"}],"summary":"Participate international space race competitions at different tracks with fast moving space ships and try to win difficult races and be the great winner.","tags":[268435466,268435488]},{"id":189150,"cover":{"id":206383,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co4f8v.jpg"},"name":"Sokobot","platforms":[{"id":6,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}],"screenshots":[{"id":723308,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scfi3w.jpg"},{"id":723309,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scfi3x.jpg"},{"id":723310,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scfi3y.jpg"},{"id":723311,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scfi3z.jpg"},{"id":723312,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scfi40.jpg"}],"summary":"SOKOBOT is an open-ended puzzle game where you place down cute robots, give them commands, and create infinitely-looping assembly lines that combine shapes together!","tags":[268435469,268435471,268435488]},{"id":129923,"cover":{"id":125696,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co2ozk.jpg"},"name":"Caves and Castles: Underworld","platforms":[{"id":6,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"},{"id":48,"name":"PlayStation 4"},{"id":49,"name":"Xbox One"},{"id":130,"name":"Nintendo Switch"},{"id":169,"name":"Xbox Series X|S"}],"screenshots":[{"id":380788,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc85tg.jpg"},{"id":380789,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc85th.jpg"},{"id":380790,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc85ti.jpg"},{"id":380791,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc85tj.jpg"},{"id":380792,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc85tk.jpg"},{"id":380793,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc85tl.jpg"},{"id":380794,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc85tm.jpg"},{"id":380795,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc85tn.jpg"}],"summary":"Find adventure beyond your imagination and riches untold as you descend into the caves beneath an ancient castle!

Shadow Warrior was developed using Ken Silverman's Build engine and improved on 3D Realms' previous Build engine game, Duke Nukem 3D. Mark Adams ported Shadow Warrior to Mac OS in August 1997.[1]\n\nThe game's improvements included introduction of true room-over-room situations, the use of 3D voxels instead of 2D sprites for weapons and usable inventory items, transparent water, climbable ladders, and assorted vehicles to drive (some armed with weapons). Although ultra-violent, the game emphasized tongue-in-cheek humor and contained some sexual themes (although less blatantly than in Duke Nukem 3D). A combination of Duke Nukem 3D and Shadow Warrior was published by GT Interactive in March 1998, titled East Meets West.[2]","tags":[1,18,27,268435460,268435461,536870973,536871019,536871041,536871076,536871139,536871262,536871365,536871378,536871507,536871516,536871617,536871626,536871882,536871889,536871937,536872317,536872406,536872666,536872799,536872873,536873236,536873591,536874398,536874688,536874743,536875097,536875216,536875242,536875322,536875406,536875448,536875483,536875484,536875527,536875531,536875574,536875610,536875814,536875839,536875919,536876215,536876261,536876266,536876356,536876365,536876385,536876412,536876454,536876642,536876652,536876855,536876980,536876999,536877040,536877234,536877282,536877287,536877307,536877309,536877312,536877405,536877512,536877551,536877628,536877653,536877677,536877799,536877936,536877952,536878004,536878018,536878219,536878423,536878488,536879013,536879042,536879709,536879711,536879718,536879996,536880225,536880318,536880625,536880639,536880747,536880925,536880959,536881233,536881578,536882611,536882664,536884496,536884917,536884935,536886267,536886268,536886269,536886270],"videos":[{"id":24979,"video_id":"cFC7MB0rX2o"}]},{"id":35594,"name":"Soccer Manager 2015","platforms":[{"id":6,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"},{"id":14,"name":"Mac"}],"screenshots":[{"id":87020,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/yf9hahzux4x571oexcy6.jpg"},{"id":87021,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/cy3ec1wujtmqvgivi4jt.jpg"},{"id":87022,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/ngurhycyq240dvbzaxmk.jpg"},{"id":87023,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/rd7x2w4v7szublfbsn3a.jpg"},{"id":87024,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/rcvvamixqyfow207fwyw.jpg"}],"summary":"If you love football as much as we do, you live and breathe it.

A place where great industrial cities house castle keeps and factories, home to Dwarves, Humans, Orcs and Elves alike. A place of ancient runes and steamworks, of magic and machines, of sorcery and science.\n\nArcanum is the first game to come from the development house Troika Games, LLC, started by former Fallout team members Tim Cain, Leonard Boyarsky, and Jason Anderson. This team takes the depth of gameplay and world-building in role-playing games to entirely new levels of realism and excitement.\n\nArcanum creates a compelling new world where magic and technology coexist in an uneasy balance. As Arcanum opens, the mechanical age has only recently arrived in this ancient land where Humans, Elves, Dwarves, Orcs and other races have learned to survive in the new sprawling industrialized cities. But this radical shift from magic to technology has created a potentially explosive situation. As the townspeople and other thinkers begin mass production of light bulbs, batteries, eyeglasses and guns, the Mages grow leery. This tightly wound setting is the starting point from which the character must set out on his quest.","tags":[17,18,268435468,268435471,268435472,536871138,536871139,536871208,536871213,536871409,536871422,536871504,536871818,536871938,536872184,536872225,536872260,536872352,536872371,536872435,536872647,536872690,536872746,536872810,536872847,536872898,536872978,536873066,536873364,536873863,536874136,536874182,536874398,536874694,536875059,536875151,536875196,536875257,536875265,536875304,536875305,536875311,536875358,536875361,536875455,536875483,536875488,536875531,536875572,536875735,536875762,536875765,536875774,536875779,536875791,536875792,536875803,536875822,536875941,536876262,536876606,536876662,536876847,536876882,536876974,536877155,536877207,536877209,536877519,536877554,536877593,536877595,536877597,536877600,536877645,536877990,536878421,536878494,536878535,536879713,536880182,536880218,536880638,536880836,536880839,536882084,536883035,536884030],"videos":[{"id":245,"video_id":"O5ImMBWGc_w"}]},{"id":1105,"aggregated_rating":95.0,"cover":{"id":181616,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co3w4w.jpg"},"name":"Metroid

It is the second multiplayer-focused game in the Quake series after Quake III Arena. \n \nQuake Wars features similar gameplay to Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory, but with the addition of controllable vehicles and aircraft as well as multiple AI deployables, asymmetric teams, much larger maps and the option of computer-controlled bot opponents.

The latest chapter in the Assassin's Creed saga also includes revolutionary gameplay, allowing players to manipulate the construct of Desmond's memories and the Animus to decipher the mysteries of his past and gain insight into the future.","tags":[1,17,22,23,33,38,268435487,536870934,536871033,536871063,536871139,536871169,536871302,536871535,536871869,536871945,536872273,536872371,536872550,536872626,536872640,536872798,536873364,536873674,536874083,536875067,536875157,536875257,536875262,536875306,536875312,536875356,536875401,536875453,536875819,536875830,536875897,536875937,536876007,536876054,536876220,536876235,536876309,536876330,536876487,536876545,536877124,536877125,536877164,536877520,536877985,536878367,536878423,536878562,536878573,536879069,536879077,536879078,536879080,536879082,536879084,536879085,536879212,536879744,536879745,536879780,536881831,536891152,536892048,536892049],"videos":[{"id":570,"video_id":"4K39UWxdm0U"},{"id":3351,"video_id":"skWGjgoERtw"}]},{"id":16940,"cover":{"id":118705,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co2jld.jpg"},"name":"Reversion: The Escape -1st Chapter","platforms":[{"id":3,"name":"Linux"},{"id":6,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"},{"id":14,"name":"Mac"}],"screenshots":[{"id":98140,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/n6sbxvduyltj7i4i5ze6.jpg"},{"id":98141,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/pp0ybf0drj3unkywzqxx.jpg"},{"id":98142,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sbfhs1hpw8dhvhkepva7.jpg"},{"id":98143,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sgyozxc7cggzbb1tjblo.jpg"},{"id":98144,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sf24c22lggxpsi5thihv.jpg"}],"summary":"Reversion is a science-fiction Point&Click Adventure Game.

Regain control of a futuristic Tokyo from an emerging robotic threat in the year 2080. The story starts when Dan Marshall and his squad are sent to bring the robotic community under control as they begin to infiltrate society and slowly take over undetected, leaving humans redundant in their wake. Fighting through the derelict lower levels of the city, players control an international peace-keeping squad that soon starts to question their surroundings and the choices they make. Are the robots becoming more human, or are humans becoming more like machines?\n\nThrilling encounters with these highly intelligent robotic enemies require you to think tactically, make challenging, real-time moral decisions and build up trust with your team mates in order to guide your squad to safety and success.","tags":[1,18,268435461,536870979,536871015,536871079,536871219,536871487,536871489,536871500,536871758,536871878,536871882,536871937,536872070,536872100,536872205,536872225,536872245,536872335,536872339,536872439,536872550,536872583,536872883,536873236,536873248,536873455,536873810,536874398,536874743,536874745,536874824,536874900,536874916,536875046,536875062,536875063,536875081,536875083,536875125,536875156,536875157,536875199,536875217,536875244,536875271,536875281,536875303,536875305,536875309,536875314,536875317,536875358,536875396,536875437,536875483,536875484,536875492,536875527,536875533,536875538,536875572,536875573,536875593,536875623,536875638,536875695,536875729,536875762,536875767,536875770,536875802,536875803,536875808,536875908,536875910,536875914,536876214,536876260,536876261,536876262,536876361,536876363,536876364,536876367,536876384,536876391,536876453,536876476,536876521,536876569,536876587,536876633,536876686,536876687,536876695,536876703,536876798,536876815,536876853,536876901,536876918,536876922,536876938,536876948,536876980,536876996,536877028,536877149,536877152,536877156,536877226,536877264,536877287,536877307,536877346,536877373,536877407,536877496,536877497,536877656,536877725,536877830,536877951,536877993,536878014,536878018,536878269,536878270,536878281,536878327,536878333,536878387,536878396,536878459,536878490,536878494,536878550,536878572,536878573,536878580,536879059,536879062,536879068,536879073,536879184,536879806,536879910,536880092,536880134,536880201,536880229,536880343,536880703,536880814,536880863,536880864,536880872,536880946,536881234,536881539,536881831,536882210,536882388,536882452,536882674,536882680,536883260,536883261,536888127,536889479,536891332,536891333],"videos":[{"id":6296,"video_id":"Qp1SGtosGI0"}]},{"id":7081,"aggregated_rating":72.7142857142857,"cover":{"id":77272,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co1nmg.jpg"},"name":"Battlefield Hardline","platforms":[{"id":6,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"},{"id":9,"name":"PlayStation 3"},{"id":12,"name":"Xbox 360"},{"id":48,"name":"PlayStation 4"},{"id":49,"name":"Xbox One"}],"screenshots":[{"id":5707,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/szyh2jb0vrzkv7ppj9ao.jpg"},{"id":5708,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/x9lvwlci1vu4mpia5qrq.jpg"},{"id":5709,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/h6g4yiyc5rjaclidup4w.jpg"},{"id":5932,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/iz2kcgydb1xkq9wi6n0a.jpg"},{"id":5933,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/htkgytjxatmodetyayxp.jpg"}],"summary":"Battlefield: Hardline features a whole new variety of gameplay that breaks away from the traditional Battlefield game modes.

Players will have access to various millitary grade weapons and vehicles as well as having police equipment such as tasers and handcuffs.","tags":[1,23,39,268435461,536870933,536871127,536871133,536871134,536871157,536871196,536871339,536871345,536871361,536871365,536871378,536871470,536871474,536871475,536871791,536871801,536871937,536872070,536872140,536872205,536872245,536872482,536872511,536872581,536872594,536872695,536872799,536872840,536873454,536873455,536873652,536875096,536875154,536875157,536875173,536875194,536875199,536875217,536875228,536875229,536875231,536875242,536875270,536875332,536875342,536875358,536875364,536875402,536875420,536875432,536875440,536875483,536875488,536875494,536875498,536875513,536875523,536875527,536875537,536875549,536875564,536875728,536875742,536875746,536875756,536875787,536875802,536875807,536875813,536875815,536875819,536875830,536875831,536875873,536875892,536875910,536876098,536876103,536876108,536876109,536876171,536876176,536876179,536876186,536876197,536876227,536876229,536876235,536876281,536876289,536876338,536876343,536876365,536876383,536876456,536876529,536876665,536876670,536876683,536876724,536876833,536876880,536876901,536876915,536876917,536876970,536877028,536877049,536877109,536877128,536877143,536877147,536877150,536877152,536877153,536877166,536877170,536877180,536877278,536877306,536877332,536877334,536877337,536877339,536877451,536877499,536877502,536877605,536877623,536877743,536877758,536877846,536877879,536878065,536878247,536878265,536878490,536878554,536879042,536879054,536879059,536879062,536879128,536879184,536879192,536879196,536879645,536879788,536879819,536879832,536879981,536879984,536880190,536880304,536880345,536880442,536880507,536880613,536880640,536880642,536880721,536880781,536880786,536880826,536881017,536881113,536881298,536881584,536881585,536881586,536881587,536881588,536881589,536881590,536881591,536881592,536881593,536881594,536881831,536881944,536890412,536890413],"videos":[{"id":2662,"video_id":"gciurrO3eI0"},{"id":2841,"video_id":"UeWlFhIhe7Y"},{"id":2849,"video_id":"_XA7A5yyj_U"}]},{"id":90304,"name":"Wonderful Hand","platforms":[{"id":3,"name":"Linux"},{"id":6,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}],"screenshots":[{"id":201156,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/v3d03wqvglt4lybzwov6.jpg"},{"id":201157,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/s61ezlutzphfczlnbl3v.jpg"},{"id":201158,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/yee2c7woinmucilguigg.jpg"},{"id":201159,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/dqzm3gfaxstum6xhkcxm.jpg"},{"id":201160,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/lhlsmxhettentauqt3v9.jpg"},{"id":201161,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/ct2abtahz2fkeca4uyhv.jpg"},{"id":201162,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/invwyemf8ove8pqilfov.jpg"},{"id":201163,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/tjcs9g3a8mgt3jzec6kz.jpg"},{"id":201164,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/yj97h7tcup7oqjnah66f.jpg"}],"summary":"People are stacks of blocks.

The second installment in the Unreal series, it was first published by GT Interactive in 1999 for Microsoft Windows, and later released on the PlayStation 2 by Infogrames, and on the Dreamcast by Secret Level. Players compete in a series of matches of various types, with the general aim of out-killing opponents. The PC version supports multiplayer online or over a local area network. Free expansion packs were released, some of which were bundled with a 2000 re-release: Unreal Tournament: Game of the Year Edition. \n \nThe game is based on the same technology that powered Unreal, but the design of Unreal Tournament shifted the series' focus to competitive multiplayer action. Development took 18 months, and the game was initially intended to be an expansion for Unreal.

He also earns blue gems from defeating foes which will allow him to level up his powers.","tags":[1,27,268435464,268435487,536870916,536871208,536871244,536871262,536871306,536871506,536871904,536871939,536872961,536872983,536873021,536873236,536873384,536875073,536875074,536875209,536875244,536875271,536875390,536875396,536875404,536875699,536876353,536876496,536877057,536877230,536877565,536877634,536877639,536877692,536877755,536877966,536878024,536878505,536883995,536887206,536887207,536887208]},{"id":185231,"cover":{"id":199891,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co4a8j.jpg"},"name":"Time to Morp","platforms":[{"id":6,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}],"screenshots":[{"id":701219,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scf12b.jpg"},{"id":701220,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scf12c.jpg"},{"id":701221,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scf12d.jpg"},{"id":701222,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scf12e.jpg"},{"id":701223,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scf12f.jpg"}],"summary":"Time to Morp is a colony sim game in which you take care of playful creatures - Morps.

It is a collection of: \n \nSonic the Hedgehog. \nSonic the Hedgehog 2. \nSonic the Hedgehog 3. \nSonic & Knuckles (With Sonic 3 and Knuckles, and Knuckles in Sonic 2). \n \nThis compilation was officially announced on December 2, 2009 by Sega of America and was released March 2, 2010, although news of this compilation first broke when it was classified by the Australian Government's OFLC. It features two extra lock-on modes from the originals, which allows the player to play as Knuckles in Sonic 2 and to play the complete version of Sonic 3 (titled \"Knuckles in Sonic 3\" as opposed to the original \"Sonic 3 & Knuckles\" title). The games receive the addition of a save option; while players can \"save anywhere\" as billed, they must restart the act in which they saved - they are, however, allowed to keep their score and Chaos Emeralds from when they saved, as well as any extra lives and continues earned. The collection also includes a gallery of images. \n \nIt was originally supposed to also include Sonic Spinball, Dr. Robotnik's Mean Bean Machine, and Sonic 3D Blast but none of those three games made it into the final product. \n \nThe game was met with mixed to positive reactions from critics, receiving a 70 out of 100 on Metacritic. Praise was directed at the quality of the games included, but was criticized for its lack of a multiplayer mode and how the artwork included was the only extras included.","tags":[1,268435464,268435487]},{"id":44602,"cover":{"id":154692,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co3bd0.jpg"},"name":"Anarchy: Rush Hour","platforms":[{"id":9,"name":"PlayStation 3"}],"screenshots":[{"id":499287,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scap93.jpg"},{"id":499288,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scap94.jpg"},{"id":499289,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scap95.jpg"},{"id":499290,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scap96.jpg"},{"id":499291,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scap97.jpg"}],"summary":"Anarchy: Rush Hour is a driving game that is available on PSN.","tags":[1,268435466,536870937,536871647,536874337,536874539,536875069,536875117,536875151,536875157,536875490,536876487,536878247,536890529,536893048,536893049,536893050],"videos":[{"id":51539,"video_id":"w-L5XZdqQw8"}]},{"id":32640,"cover":{"id":104796,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co28v0.jpg"},"name":"BallisticNG","platforms":[{"id":6,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}],"screenshots":[{"id":322276,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc6wo4.jpg"},{"id":322277,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc6wo5.jpg"},{"id":322278,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc6wo6.jpg"},{"id":322279,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc6wo7.jpg"},{"id":322280,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc6wo8.jpg"},{"id":322281,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc6wo9.jpg"},{"id":322282,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc6woa.jpg"}],"summary":"Glide through futuristic courses at breakneck speeds and eliminate those who stand in your way.

Under the Union's protection are the Hierarchs and the Goddess, currently Caim's sister Furiae, who is a human manifestation of one of the four seals that protect the world from being broken. As the game begins, Cain is fatally wounded in a battle with the Empire. Encountering a captured Red Dragon who is also near death, Caim makes a fateful choice. In exchange for both their lives, the Red Dragon and Caim will enter a pact. This pact will forever chain their lives to one another and link their souls, at the cost of something irreplaceable. Recharged with the fires of a Dragon, Caim's vengeance burns over the enemy...\n\nThe player controls Caim on his quest. The game is separated into three distinct modes: Aerial combat, Ground combat and Event Combat. In Aerial Combat, Caim rides dragonback against a variety of airborne foes breathing fireballs (strong single shots and weaker multiple lock-on shots). The Dragon is agile and is able to evade incoming threats, turning around completely in a moment. In Ground combat, the game is shown in 3rd person though usually large, open areas. Controlling Caim, his primary ability is the use of a variety of weapons found on the battlefield. These are leveled up through continued usage, and specifically through the killing of individual enemies. Though magic (determined by weapon choice), timed attacks and evasion, Caim breaks through enemy armies. Characters recruited as allies by Caim can also be summoned during battles, steadily losing health until control is returned to Caim. In ground combat, Caim may also call forth his Dragon to ride and strafe enemies from the air. The Dragon's movements are generally the same as in aerial combat but more limited and less agile. Event combat is similar to Ground combat, but shown isometrically, restricted to a single weapon and without the aid of a dragon. It is used mainly to tell story sequences.\n\nLevels that have been visited before might become \"Expedition Missions\" which are optional and contain new objectives, enemies and weapons. Additionally, any level previously played in the storyline may be revisited at any time. Depending on Caim's choices (and prerequisites for those choices), there are five different endings to Drakengard.","tags":[1,17,19,268435468,536870934,536871041,536871138,536871139,536871148,536871208,536871244,536871301,536871409,536871449,536871504,536871535,536871938,536872014,536872093,536872098,536872211,536872225,536872232,536872622,536873111,536873384,536873949,536873999,536874398,536874743,536874830,536875081,536875125,536875214,536875265,536875271,536875309,536875318,536875319,536875383,536875390,536875453,536875455,536875503,536875523,536875549,536875621,536875657,536875699,536875762,536875767,536875778,536875791,536875804,536875830,536875912,536876007,536876010,536876057,536876086,536876087,536876266,536876296,536876315,536876356,536876471,536876505,536876590,536876601,536876607,536876854,536876964,536877211,536877406,536877560,536877624,536877696,536877954,536878553,536879689,536879908,536880168,536880217,536880235,536880378,536880500,536880622,536880655,536880832,536880880,536880889,536881643,536883154,536884027,536887060],"videos":[{"id":4989,"video_id":"FqoyOpYOdWU"}]},{"id":186819,"cover":{"id":205601,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co4en5.jpg"},"name":"V696","platforms":[{"id":6,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}],"screenshots":[{"id":708284,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scf6ik.jpg"},{"id":708285,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scf6il.jpg"},{"id":708286,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scf6im.jpg"},{"id":708287,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scf6in.jpg"},{"id":708288,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scf6io.jpg"}],"summary":"V696 is a first-person horror-thriller game.

As Dungeon Masters, they will use the loot from conquests to customize their own dungeons and put together a powerful deck of Bosses, Monsters and Trap cards to defend their riches at all costs.\nAn additional level of strategy is introduced as multi-player battles are fought asynchronously, which means each player can take their time to plan their defense.\nLabyrinth is set in a vast and wondrous city called Starfall.  Once a peaceful and thriving market city, age-old pacts and alliances have broken down creating turmoil and unrest.  The  earliest  settlers  have  consolidated  their  power  and  look  to  push  out  rivals  while newcomers to the city seek to carve out territory for themselves.  As night falls, a silent war  begins  in  the  tunnels,  alleys,  and  halls  of  the  ancient city  and  every  player  must battle for survival.","tags":[268435468,268435471,268435488],"videos":[{"id":7382,"video_id":"6U4eGed7QC4"},{"id":7383,"video_id":"I82WbSv6n6Y"}]},{"id":92590,"cover":{"id":217901,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co4o4t.jpg"},"name":"Sverigejakten","platforms":[{"id":6,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"},{"id":14,"name":"Mac"}],"screenshots":[{"id":356672,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc7n7k.jpg"},{"id":778424,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scgomw.jpg"},{"id":778425,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scgomx.jpg"},{"id":778426,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scgomy.jpg"},{"id":778427,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scgomz.jpg"},{"id":778428,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scgon0.jpg"},{"id":778429,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scgon1.jpg"},{"id":778430,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scgon2.jpg"},{"id":778431,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scgon3.jpg"},{"id":778432,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scgon4.jpg"},{"id":778433,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scgon5.jpg"},{"id":778434,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scgon6.jpg"}],"summary":"Sverigejakten is a Swedish educational game where the player needs to catch the bad guy by travelling around Sweden as detectives.","tags":[34,268435471,536871127,536872918,536873027,536881781,536888308,536894695],"videos":[{"id":33732,"video_id":"EhP1KwxTDyU"}]},{"id":144207,"cover":{"id":132599,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co2ubb.jpg"},"name":"Instant Sports Tennis","platforms":[{"id":130,"name":"Nintendo Switch"}],"screenshots":[{"id":424801,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc93s1.jpg"},{"id":424802,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc93s2.jpg"}],"summary":"Instant Sports Tennis is an innovative and fun way to play tennis with your family and friends.

The main focus of the game is exploration of the game world and cataloguing the various species of animals found there. Endless Ocean slightly differs from its predecessors in that the traditional \"game elements\" have been mostly removed - where Everblue 2 set a goal for the player by having them search for treasure underwater, Endless Ocean is more freeform and just lets the player explore at their own pace. There are still treasures to find, but as Endless Ocean is mostly freeform exploration and has no overarching plot, the player is in no obligation to look for these items to progress through the game.","tags":[32,34,268435469,268435487,536870984,536871183,536871315,536871691,536871728,536871939,536872010,536872060,536872415,536872484,536872746,536873236,536873364,536873495,536875052,536875130,536875155,536875232,536875352,536875464,536875545,536875598,536875599,536875601,536875602,536875610,536875695,536875705,536875735,536875852,536875872,536876055,536876106,536876204,536876318,536876496,536876517,536876519,536876540,536876617,536876960,536877535,536877690,536877771,536878227,536878389,536878500,536879067,536879095,536879194,536879810,536879999,536880032,536880033,536880034,536880097,536880179,536880453,536880839,536881006,536881094,536881497,536882771,536882804,536883618,536883995,536884745,536884746,536884747,536884748,536884749,536884750,536884751,536884752,536884753,536884754,536884755,536884756,536884757,536884758,536884759,536884760,536884761,536884762,536884763,536884764,536884765,536884766,536884767,536884768,536884769,536884770,536884771,536884772,536884773,536884774,536884775,536884776,536884777,536884778,536884779,536884780,536884781,536884782,536884783,536884784,536884785,536884786,536884787,536884788,536884789,536884790,536884791,536884792,536884793,536884794,536884795,536884796,536884797,536884798,536884799,536884800,536884801,536884802,536884803,536884804,536884805,536884806,536884807,536884808,536884809,536884810,536884811,536884812,536884813,536884814,536884815,536884816,536884817,536884818,536884819,536884820,536884821,536884822,536884823,536884824,536885482],"videos":[{"id":2929,"video_id":"FpHQinpnum4"}]}]
