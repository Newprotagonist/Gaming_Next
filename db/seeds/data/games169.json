Players interact with NPCs as well as specific objects by clicking or dragging. An in-game hint system is located on the bottom left corner of the screen as a question mark. Items carried by players can be combined with additional items. Objects return to their original position whenever they are dropped. Interactive cut scenes are triggered once a player has completed location objectives.\n\nTo complete the game, the player explores real life locations such as Paris, New Orleans or Havana. Some game stages have a time limit that, if not completed is punishable by the character’s death. If a character dies, the player’s progress is saved automatically and the player may start over from their last save.\n\nArt of Murder contains a range of mechanical and slider puzzles.","tags":[20,43,268435458,268435487,536871013,536871127,536871133,536872052,536872113,536872581,536875057],"videos":[{"id":6027,"video_id":"MPi37XFK8ic"},{"id":6028,"video_id":"Iqfp5zjDuA8"}]},{"id":200645,"name":"How to Live a Healthy Hentai Lifestyle!","platforms":[{"id":6,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}],"screenshots":[{"id":790533,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scgxz9.jpg"}],"summary":"Gotou Hajime has enrolled in Penile University, majoring in perversion in order to study and deepen his understanding of the art and eventually carry out research on the subject.\n\nDue to Hajime’s chosen field of study, he has registered to live with the Maezono family – a family whose mother is the legendary pervert that prevented World War 3 with her sexual diplomacy!","tags":[42,268435490,536872873,536874498]},{"id":200646,"cover":{"id":221058,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co4qki.jpg"},"name":"Ari In Wonderland: Episode 1","platforms":[{"id":6,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}],"screenshots":[{"id":790534,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scgxza.jpg"},{"id":790535,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scgxzb.jpg"}],"summary":"Ari after a long day falls fast asleep and goes back into wonderland.

The game retains the same basic gameplay mechanics from the series albeit with several new changes, most notably the addition of the \"Star\" symbol to the game's existing symbols of cross, circle, square, triangle and arrows. The \"Star\" symbol represents the \"Scratch\" move where instead of pressing the face buttons as usual, players rub the screen or flick the analogue stick, depending on which system is being used. \"Chance Time\" has been modified from previous installments, with each successful beat filling a star shaped gauge on the bottom left of the screen. When filled, it triggers a final scratch symbol that, if successfully scored, will change the outcome of the scene. Another new mechanic is the \"Technical Zone\" mechanic. When it occurs during a song, players must maintain an uninterrupted combo within that time limit for bonus points.","tags":[268435463,536870990,536871080,536871186,536871363,536872804,536875046,536875049,536875157,536875244,536875271,536875422,536876217,536876228,536876229,536876703,536876869,536876870,536877124,536878193,536878222,536878298,536878327,536878605,536880243,536880354,536890016,536890924,536890925],"videos":[{"id":5225,"video_id":"TNXb7Ko6G_s"},{"id":5226,"video_id":"WBxVhAZZN58"}]},{"id":148935,"cover":{"id":141391,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co313j.jpg"},"name":"Comic 5trike","platforms":[{"id":6,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}],"screenshots":[{"id":466324,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc9ztg.jpg"},{"id":466325,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc9zth.jpg"},{"id":466326,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc9zti.jpg"}],"summary":"Save the world using superpowers while fighting hordes of enemies with your friends!\n\n5 friends get themselves tangled in a fight against a crazy doctor, a girl that can control black holes, and hordes of robots hunting for the same beings that gave the kids their superpowers.","tags":[1,40,268435464,268435481,268435487,536899707,536899708,536899709,536899710,536899711,536899712],"videos":[{"id":49748,"video_id":"zgRZIQYU8ZU"}]},{"id":22277,"aggregated_rating":80.0,"cover":{"id":77150,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co1nj2.jpg"},"name":"Picross e","platforms":[{"id":37,"name":"Nintendo 3DS"}],"screenshots":[{"id":168789,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/k2orsedy7hsaxfykuamm.jpg"},{"id":168790,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/kghxxakidoza99mcrvat.jpg"},{"id":168791,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/ivno1yufv8yymx7tf5tz.jpg"},{"id":168792,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/y8kivkytk6f6jhs8cps2.jpg"}],"summary":"Use numbers as hints to complete illustrations in this series of \"picture crossword puzzles\", which Nintendo has been developing as its own brand of game software since 1995.","tags":[268435465,268435471,536873335]},{"id":21017,"aggregated_rating":71.6666666666667,"cover":{"id":139321,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co2zi1.jpg"},"name":"Aero Porter","platforms":[{"id":37,"name":"Nintendo 3DS"}],"screenshots":[{"id":29119,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/vfwf7b6rtat3y6qu0hd3.jpg"},{"id":180374,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/fnoxpstxgkcqm1kwkypu.jpg"},{"id":180375,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/rahmygstkxe5rpsmtdjm.jpg"},{"id":180376,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/idahzjawoixlcbiujp4k.jpg"},{"id":180377,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/unzpsivnxikcpiug9r84.jpg"},{"id":180378,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/ic4upygt6nk9fbryzc00.jpg"}],"summary":"Pulled from the Guild01 compilation released at retail in Japan, three original games from LEVEL-5 and several well-known Japanese collaborators will launch in the Nintendo eShop for Nintendo 3DS.","tags":[268435465,268435469]},{"id":192032,"cover":{"id":218744,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co4os8.jpg"},"name":"Action: Source","platforms":[{"id":6,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}],"screenshots":[{"id":780031,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scgpvj.jpg"},{"id":780032,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scgpvk.jpg"},{"id":780033,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scgpvl.jpg"}],"summary":"Action: Source is a free to play mod for the Source Engine.

The game is a spin on American football, the violence of the Medieval football with no rules and rugby-style of sports yet set in a fantasy world with teams being made up of fantasy races such as dwarves, elves, orcs and undead, along with the use of magic and other fictional elements during a \"match\". The tone of the game is satirical with comedic color commentary and adverts for fictional in-game universe products. An official expansion was later released in 2005 bundled with the original, titled Chaos League: Sudden Death that added new features and gameplay tweaks. \n \nWhile not a direct video game adaption, Chaos League bears resemblance to Games Workshop's Blood Bowl tabletop board game, which is also about fantasy sports. Cyanide Studios would later develop the video game version of Blood Bowl in 2009, which itself utilizes certain features from Chaos League.","tags":[1,17,27,28,268435467,268435470,268435471,536870938,536870939,536870944,536871008,536871063,536871208,536871262,536871906,536871938,536872078,536872232,536872383,536872978,536874694,536875074,536875265,536875316,536876235,536877040,536877686,536878073,536878352,536880933,536884022,536894143]},{"id":191337,"cover":{"id":210729,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co4ill.jpg"},"name":"Sigmund Minisode 2","platforms":[{"id":3,"name":"Linux"},{"id":6,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"},{"id":14,"name":"Mac"}],"screenshots":[{"id":738014,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scftge.jpg"},{"id":738015,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scftgf.jpg"},{"id":738016,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scftgg.jpg"}],"summary":"A new 20-minute holiday special taking place at Sigmund Corp, where Neil and Eva work.","tags":[18,31,268435468,268435487,268435488]},{"id":124086,"cover":{"id":202633,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co4ccp.jpg"},"name":"Safari Pinball","platforms":[{"id":130,"name":"Nintendo Switch"},{"id":167,"name":"PlayStation 5"}],"screenshots":[{"id":450139,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc9nbv.jpg"},{"id":450141,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc9nbx.jpg"},{"id":450143,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc9nbz.jpg"},{"id":450145,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc9nc1.jpg"},{"id":450147,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc9nc3.jpg"}],"summary":"Get ready for Safari Pinball, a pinball machine where you'll try to photograph and record many animals through a Africa.

According to the game's producer Kazuhiro Tsuchiya, Asura's Wrath takes elements from Hinduism and Buddhism and blends them with science fiction, with the main character based on the ever combative and superiority-seeking beings of the same name that are part of the Hindu and Buddhist cosmology.","tags":[1,268435481,536870990,536871208,536873724,536875157,536875257,536876113,536876736,536876923,536877383,536877594,536878553,536878554],"videos":[{"id":10051,"video_id":"YJ30HjDBngw"}]},{"id":95668,"cover":{"id":104800,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co28v4.jpg"},"name":"Barro","platforms":[{"id":6,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}],"screenshots":[{"id":208215,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/ba5gycyy5j1pp2pzzgap.jpg"},{"id":208216,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/htln7pn1j8opjlrobzle.jpg"},{"id":208217,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/njvxyqtbk3cswm9vy0yi.jpg"},{"id":208218,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/h5qxqqaouujhuj2sicus.jpg"},{"id":208219,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/udp87rtydxe0u0i5nztf.jpg"},{"id":208220,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/l1ny6451zhezhida5n34.jpg"},{"id":208221,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/wjrkj6otkbke9cuxdeo7.jpg"},{"id":208222,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/whftl3dpefysxqq5urbn.jpg"},{"id":208223,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/ootjycjkor9leewqjlqo.jpg"},{"id":208224,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/lokzq3111b3jfu9fblg4.jpg"},{"id":208225,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/nckkwyuit20tg2jmwh6j.jpg"},{"id":208226,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/lgacgeeaxpfgmczimq79.jpg"}],"summary":"Barro is a simple arcade racing game for one or two players (in split-screen).

Its success led to the production of several updated versions, each offering additional features and characters over previous versions, as well as many home versions. Some of the home versions of the Street Fighter II games have sold millions of copies, with the SNES port of the first Street Fighter II being Capcom's best-selling consumer game of all-time as of 2008.\n\nStreet Fighter II follows several of the conventions and rules already established by its original 1987 predecessor. The player engages opponents in one-on-one close quarter combat in a series of best-two-out-of-three matches. The objective of each round is to deplete the opponent's vitality before the timer runs out. If both opponents knock each other out at the same time or the timer runs out with both fighters having an equal amount of vitality left, a \"double KO\" or \"draw game\" is declared and additional rounds will be played until sudden death. In the first Street Fighter II, a match could last up to ten rounds if there was no clear winner; this was reduced to four rounds in Champion Edition and onward. If there is no clear winner by the end of the final round, then either the computer-controlled opponent will win by default in a single-player match or both fighters will lose in a 2-player match.\n\nAfter every third match in the single player mode, the player will participate in a \"bonus game\" for additional points. The bonus games includes (in order) a car-breaking event; a barrel breaking bonus game where the barrels are dropped off from a conveyor belt above the player; and a drum-breaking bonus game where drums are flammable and piled over each other. The bonus games were removed from the arcade version of Super Street Fighter II Turbo.\n\nLike in the original, the game's controls uses a configuration of an eight-directional joystick and six attack buttons. The player uses the joystick to jump, crouch and move the character towards or away from the opponent, as well as to guard the character from an opponent's attacks. There are three punch buttons and three kick buttons of differing strength and speed (Light, Medium and Heavy). The player can perform a variety of basic moves in any position, including grabbing/throwing attacks, which were not featured in the original Street Fighter. Like in the original, the player can perform special moves by inputting a combination of directional and button-based commands.\n\nStreet Fighter II differs from the original due to the selection of multiple playable characters, each with their distinct fighting styles and special moves. Additionally, the player can also \"cancel\" during animation by performing another move, allowing for a combination of several basic and special moves. Both of these features would be expanded upon in subsequent installments.","tags":[1,18,268435460,268435489,536870973,536870979,536871139,536871213,536871470,536871487,536871506,536871872,536871882,536871971,536871987,536872010,536872211,536872258,536872287,536872617,536872898,536872961,536873021,536873192,536873590,536874209,536874398,536874706,536874743,536874745,536875046,536875073,536875075,536875083,536875091,536875101,536875125,536875151,536875201,536875207,536875208,536875214,536875229,536875303,536875305,536875342,536875377,536875440,536875493,536875511,536875538,536875609,536875662,536875689,536875691,536875734,536875760,536875822,536875852,536875912,536875917,536875934,536875942,536876028,536876029,536876031,536876270,536876273,536876287,536876353,536876474,536876526,536876633,536876634,536876687,536876754,536876805,536876806,536876820,536876880,536877297,536877607,536877608,536877696,536878037,536878087,536878199,536878209,536878439,536880873],"videos":[{"id":2494,"video_id":"b5Rwk5boOpg"}]},{"id":49030,"cover":{"id":135195,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co2wbf.jpg"},"name":"Prehistorik Man","platforms":[{"id":19,"name":"Super Nintendo Entertainment System (SNES)"},{"id":24,"name":"Game Boy Advance"},{"id":34,"name":"Android"},{"id":39,"name":"iOS"},{"id":58,"name":"Super Famicom"},{"id":130,"name":"Nintendo Switch"}],"screenshots":[{"id":428152,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc96d4.jpg"},{"id":428153,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc96d5.jpg"},{"id":428154,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc96d6.jpg"},{"id":551862,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scbtti.jpg"},{"id":551863,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scbttj.jpg"},{"id":551864,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scbttk.jpg"},{"id":551865,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scbttl.jpg"},{"id":551866,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scbttm.jpg"},{"id":551867,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scbttn.jpg"},{"id":551868,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scbtto.jpg"},{"id":551869,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scbttp.jpg"},{"id":551870,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scbttq.jpg"}],"summary":"In a small prehistoric village, disaster has struck!

In this third-person action-adventure, a cult of demons known only as the Grigori (and who, incidentally, have been masquerading as humans for the past 2000 years), are intent on resurrecting their master, Asmodeus. Doing so will bring about a cataclysmic end to all of humanity. As both, Mike Leroi and his alter ego Shadow Man, players must explore six worlds; each with numerous sub-locations, in their quest to prevent these vile creatures from bringing their diabolical scheme to fruition.\n\nWhen engaged in combat Mike LeRoi can attack with a bevy of armaments, running the gamut from powerful projectile-based weapons to short-range melee ones with which to bludgeon an opponent to death with. Additionally, it's possible for players to equip a different weapon in each hand, or alternatively, to equip a single, heavier two-handed weapon. When wielded by Shadow Man himself, weapons take on additional properties. A lock-on cursor can be used to target specific enemies, allowing the player to dodge and attack with consummate ease. Interspersed throughout the title are puzzles that must be solved in order for Shadow Man to advance through the worlds.\n\nThroughout the quest Mike will experience constantly changing weather and time; day changes to night, and back again in real-time, with inclement weather prevailing in many parts of the game world. Returning to the fold are Mama Nettie and Jaunty, two of Shadow Man's cohorts from the original title, while Thomas Deacon, the wheelchair-bound guardian of an ancient book the Grigori are after, makes his debut appearance. Shadow Man: 2econd Coming features mature, violent themes that touch upon subjects such as religion and voodoo. The cut-scenes feature character dialogue that is equally adult oriented.","tags":[1,19,268435461,268435487,536871088,536871139,536871937,536871945,536872032,536872117,536873066,536874947,536875222,536875331,536875483,536875572,536875891,536876262,536876432,536876577,536876612,536876706,536877009,536877306,536877628,536877631,536877810,536877973,536878009,536881358,536885965]},{"id":1746,"cover":{"id":93407,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co202n.jpg"},"name":"Mega Man X6","platforms":[{"id":6,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"},{"id":7,"name":"PlayStation"}],"screenshots":[{"id":282019,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc61lv.jpg"},{"id":282020,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc61lw.jpg"},{"id":282021,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc61lx.jpg"}],"summary":"Mission Critical...

But Sutekh's seedy underworld is about to be infiltrated by a superhero unlike the world has even seen. A superhero who can melt into the darkness like a phantom.\n\nBy day this brave crimefighter is a common ordinary citizen. But when night falls, he is cloaked in a secret identity to seek out and destroy the dark forces that lurk on midnight streets. Who is this man the press calls Nightshade? Only you can answer that... for he is you.\n\nEvery night you solidify your superhero status, patrolling one hundred of the city's darkest corners, including King Rat's filthy underground hideout and the League of Unreasonable Gentlemen. Here you'll find thieves, muggers and other alley scum that you must either deal with or destroy for clues. But be warned. You're not the only night stalker. For as you hunt Sutekh, Sutekh hunts you with the human printing press, the closing wall of spikes, deadly jackal pits, and the chilling freeze ray.\n\nTo overcome these treacherous obstacles, you must seek out hidden weapons, including energy domes, force gloves and The Staff of Ra. More importantly, you must use problem solving skills to outsmart five crime kings who hold the inner secrets to Sutekh's Lair.\n\nOf course the ultimate key to destroying Sutekh is your popularity. For it's a power source that gives you the wits to decipher clues and the strength to pulverize villains and rescue innocent bystanders. Remember. If this heroic prowess ever diminishes, you'll no longer control the night. You'll be consumed by it.","tags":[1,27,268435487,536870926,536871262,536871506,536871889,536871939,536872257,536872581,536873299,536875077,536875111,536875130,536875217,536875228,536875241,536875262,536875540,536875574,536875639,536875675,536875770,536876109,536876589,536876731,536877306,536878245,536878584,536880769,536885400],"videos":[{"id":66190,"video_id":"ayer3iYikwY"}]},{"id":12903,"cover":{"id":221267,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co4qqb.jpg"},"name":"Legends of Valour","platforms":[{"id":13,"name":"PC DOS"},{"id":16,"name":"Amiga"}],"summary":"The city of Mittledorf is in chaos - an evil cousin of the King is oppressing the people.

Creating a rich, deep world with strong drama and exceptional production values is key to what we’re all about. Rapture is set in a remote valley in June 1984 and is a story about people and how they live with each other. But it’s also about the end of the world.\n\nRapture is inspired by the fiction of John Wyndham, J. G. Ballard, John Christopher and other authors who deal with ordinary people in extraordinary circumstances. There’s a very particular English feel that we wanted to capture in the game, a combination of the epic and the intimate. Rapture also came from our obsession with post-apocalyptic gaming, and the simple idea that whilst we normally play as the hero, in reality, most of us would be the piles of ash and bone littering the game world. That’s an interesting place to start telling a story.\n\nOur approach is to create a game that you can utterly immerse yourself in. Yaughton Valley, where Rapture takes place, is a living, breathing world. The world of Rapture is not just a backdrop; it’s a character in its own right. It’s great working with PS4 as its processing power makes a game like this possible for a team our size.\n\nThe game is all about discovery. It’s open-world so you have the freedom to explore wherever you like, visiting areas in an order you define, and the story is written to allow this whilst making sure every player has a strong dramatic experience. It’s a type of storytelling that is completely unique to games. The choices you make as a player have a direct impact on how you understand the story – the more you explore and interact, the deeper you are drawn into Rapture’s world.","tags":[18,31,268435487,268435488,536870981,536870984,536871939,536872070,536872229,536872405,536872695,536872712,536873249,536874706,536874810,536874834,536874916,536875046,536875050,536875062,536875090,536875151,536875242,536875254,536875259,536875271,536875326,536875340,536875494,536875500,536875503,536875529,536875542,536875547,536875564,536875638,536875649,536875650,536875668,536875808,536875809,536876108,536876187,536876292,536876594,536876654,536876666,536877077,536877173,536877268,536877334,536877914,536878046,536878099,536878206,536890214,536890215],"videos":[{"id":2666,"video_id":"fX1P_WxB9Zo"}]},{"id":49858,"cover":{"id":215828,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co4mj8.jpg"},"name":"Return of the Ninja","platforms":[{"id":22,"name":"Game Boy Color"}],"summary":"What your enemy fears the most is something it cannot see: You!\n\nA mysterious army has attacked the land of Koga and stolen an ancient and sacred scroll.

Camera angles can be switched between first-person and third-person options. Characters are improved by gaining levels. A character's level increases after it earns a set amount of experience points through the player versus environment (or \"PvE\") combat and storyline adventures. Characters' abilities are improved by increasing in level, but character skills must be purchased from specified NPCs after gaining a new level.\nThe main storyline (also known as the \"Epic Quest Line\") is presented as a series of \"Books\", which consist of series of quests called \"Chapters\". There were initially eight Books when the game was released, with new books added with each free content update.\nTolkien's Middle-earth as represented in The Lord of the Rings Online implements magic in a different manner than other MMORPGs such as World of Warcraft. There are only five \"wizards\" in the fictional world, none of which are player-controlled. Instead, there are active skills which require \"power\" (the equivalent of magic points). Some skills behave like magic (like healing or throwing a burning ember at an enemy), but are based on \"lore\". In addition, objects and artifacts are used to create effects similar to magic.\nOther features include a fast travel system and a detailed quest log with tracker and history.","tags":[1,17,268435468,536871059,536871071,536871138,536871139,536871148,536871208,536871213,536871244,536871283,536871421,536871422,536871470,536871504,536871535,536871613,536871670,536871784,536871812,536871931,536871938,536871958,536872015,536872019,536872119,536872205,536872245,536872371,536872462,536872647,536872733,536872810,536872847,536872928,536872978,536873066,536873089,536873297,536873326,536873350,536873351,536873364,536873384,536874134,536874345,536874398,536874813,536875042,536875054,536875095,536875096,536875161,536875169,536875173,536875196,536875199,536875232,536875233,536875241,536875253,536875257,536875265,536875266,536875275,536875286,536875304,536875307,536875311,536875336,536875372,536875380,536875393,536875436,536875455,536875456,536875460,536875464,536875505,536875525,536875610,536875699,536875735,536875738,536875778,536875784,536875790,536875798,536875803,536875855,536875870,536876008,536876084,536876101,536876210,536876232,536876233,536876273,536876286,536876287,536876373,536876492,536876503,536876583,536876606,536876694,536876718,536876991,536877003,536877165,536877208,536877209,536877211,536877275,536877276,536877308,536877562,536877595,536877614,536877739,536877803,536877907,536877992,536878218,536878306,536878314,536878423,536878521,536878524,536879087,536879132,536880004,536880206,536880207,536880421,536880536,536880624,536880753,536880755,536880848,536880863,536881022,536881122,536882034,536882694,536883035,536883101,536883301,536883414,536883419,536883936,536883995,536884018,536884021,536884498,536886200,536886271,536886272,536886710]},{"id":7915,"cover":{"id":115118,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co2gtq.jpg"},"name":"My Secret World by Imagine","platforms":[{"id":20,"name":"Nintendo DS"}],"screenshots":[{"id":400503,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc8l13.jpg"},{"id":400504,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc8l14.jpg"},{"id":400505,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc8l15.jpg"},{"id":400506,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc8l16.jpg"},{"id":400507,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc8l17.jpg"},{"id":400508,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc8l18.jpg"}],"summary":"Express yourself better Keep your secrets safe by locking your game with a secret code.

And with a host of wild weapons, such as giant boxing gloves and baseball bats, at their disposal, these 'toons with attitude take part in vehicular combat as it has never been seen before.","tags":[1,27,268435460,268435461,268435466,536870937,536870991,536871208,536871262,536874539,536874834,536874900,536874947,536875069,536875122,536875131,536875214,536875331,536875435,536875484,536875570,536875630,536876240,536876243,536876487,536876563,536876687,536876927,536879927,536880353,536884030]},{"id":193548,"cover":{"id":212580,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co4k10.jpg"},"name":"Whiteboyz Wit Attitude: The Pursuit of Money","platforms":[{"id":6,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"},{"id":48,"name":"PlayStation 4"}],"screenshots":[{"id":753316,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scg59g.jpg"},{"id":753317,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scg59h.jpg"},{"id":753318,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scg59i.jpg"},{"id":753319,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scg59j.jpg"}],"summary":"First there was the Whip/Nae Nae, now it’s time to Wear The Purp with the greatest rappers of all time*!

Other changes to the Items and Weapons include the reduction in the freeze time when a character is hit by the Freezing Shot, and the effect of losing coins when hit by a Slapstick.\n\nThe special tricks (which were different for each character and required the player to perform a combo to do them) were replaced by the ability of doing multiple tricks while in the air.

Your name is Jack Mower, a 20th century dude who just happened to be sucked into the world of Nox via his TV set. The world is in danger and you have to save it! But before you embark on your epic journey you must choose your path: warrior, wizard, or conjurer. \nChoose the path of a warrior, and you will be able to equip and use all manner of swords, battle-axes, war hammers, and chakrams - though you’ll leave the magical mumbo-jumbo up to the Conjurer and Wizard classes. An enchanted weapon is the closest a Warrior gets to magic but that’s OK, because magic is for sissies. \nAs a Wizard you will explore the mystical art of spell casting, ranging from enemy-confounding illusions to devastating displays of metaphysical force. You’ll also learn to set magical traps containing deadly spell combinations to thwart the unsuspecting foe. Although you’ll have to renounce the use of ungainly swords and armor in the name of your art, you will still be able to wield a staff as a last-ditch physical defense. \nIf you choose a Conjurer you will be able to magically charm and summon creatures to do your bidding. You can even create a magical creature called a bomber which can wreak sorcerous havoc on your enemies. You’ll also get plenty of experience wielding staves and bows to fend off the few enemies who manage to slip past your minions.","tags":[1,17,268435468,268435487,536871044,536871059,536871138,536871208,536871213,536871301,536871409,536871818,536871938,536871945,536872232,536872245,536872257,536872328,536872375,536872425,536872462,536872628,536872647,536872898,536873111,536873718,536873949,536874134,536874209,536874398,536874688,536874813,536874830,536874900,536875073,536875078,536875081,536875095,536875096,536875106,536875147,536875169,536875275,536875296,536875304,536875320,536875336,536875337,536875361,536875418,536875432,536875437,536875455,536875464,536875531,536875606,536875610,536875675,536875701,536875738,536875792,536875793,536875868,536875901,536875917,536876010,536876011,536876028,536876087,536876286,536876618,536876706,536876848,536876849,536876850,536876853,536876986,536877028,536877049,536877409,536877453,536877531,536877616,536877882,536878216,536878373,536878513,536878531,536879808,536879998,536880467,536880471,536880763,536883035],"videos":[{"id":2073,"video_id":"c_uhJFcC_hw"}]},{"id":18666,"cover":{"id":221113,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co4qm1.jpg"},"name":"Anna Kournikova's Smash Court Tennis","platforms":[{"id":7,"name":"PlayStation"}],"screenshots":[{"id":22506,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/yx8qsm09uyfzxob9bmzn.jpg"},{"id":22507,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/f8d9rh2s1c3lbn58kieb.jpg"}],"summary":"Anna Kournikova's Smash Court Tennis, known in Japan as Smash Court 2 (スマッシュコート2 Sumasshu Kōto Tsū), is a tennis video game developed by Namco for the PlayStation.

Later on these pads are used to activate a slingshot and throwing knives; to turn Conker into an anvil and drop downward; to shoot automatic, double-handed guns; to activate a The Matrix-inspired slow-motion effect and flip through the air shooting enemies; and much, much more.","tags":[1,17,27,268435461,268435464,268435487,536870931,536870991,536870999,536871123,536871208,536871255,536871262,536871315,536871325,536871470,536871519,536871609,536871878,536871931,536871945,536872019,536872221,536872232,536872242,536872375,536872626,536872666,536872733,536872810,536872961,536873027,536873096,536873249,536873486,536874098,536874398,536874743,536874834,536874900,536874947,536875056,536875073,536875074,536875078,536875086,536875088,536875091,536875095,536875122,536875137,536875199,536875202,536875209,536875210,536875218,536875219,536875242,536875262,536875271,536875283,536875298,536875310,536875315,536875319,536875328,536875332,536875334,536875396,536875408,536875436,536875437,536875444,536875464,536875483,536875484,536875507,536875523,536875526,536875527,536875537,536875538,536875541,536875550,536875606,536875639,536875643,536875693,536875741,536875761,536875792,536875831,536875934,536876029,536876062,536876070,536876125,536876126,536876205,536876221,536876289,536876306,536876318,536876320,536876356,536876359,536876373,536876415,536876418,536876453,536876499,536876505,536876574,536876590,536876596,536876620,536876629,536876642,536876650,536876661,536876674,536876753,536876817,536876855,536876882,536876897,536876899,536876972,536876973,536877028,536877040,536877230,536877264,536877297,536877302,536877383,536877436,536877519,536877588,536877740,536877807,536877869,536877929,536877950,536878015,536878063,536878127,536878276,536878396,536878596,536879087,536879192,536879591,536879761,536879938,536880251,536880318,536880404,536880648,536880664,536880673,536882290,536882467,536883229,536883935,536884032,536884033,536885146,536886053,536886898,536886899,536886900,536886901,536897818,536897960,536899580],"videos":[{"id":918,"video_id":"k-cWGFBBRnk"}]},{"id":191398,"cover":{"id":209044,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co4has.jpg"},"name":"Mario Strikers: Battle League","platforms":[{"id":130,"name":"Nintendo Switch"}],"screenshots":[{"id":738276,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scftno.jpg"},{"id":738277,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scftnp.jpg"},{"id":738278,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scftnq.jpg"},{"id":738279,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scftnr.jpg"},{"id":738280,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scftns.jpg"},{"id":738281,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scftnt.jpg"}],"summary":"Introducing Mario Strikers: Battle League, a 5-on-5, soccer-like sport with no rules - do whatever it takes to win!

It was first released in Japan, and was later released in North America, Australia, Europe, and other regions. It was originally released in three different versions: Dachshund & Friends, Lab & Friends (Shiba & Friends in Japan), and Chihuahua & Friends. It has been re-released twice since then, first as a bundled release with a special edition Nintendo DS with a new version called Nintendogs: Best Friends, and then later as Nintendogs: Dalmatian & Friends.\n\nNintendogs uses the DS's touchscreen and built-in microphone. The touch screen allows the player to pet a dog, as well as to use various items that can be found or purchased. These range from balls and frisbees, to toys, to grooming supplies to keep the dogs happy. The microphone is used to call to the player's dog by speaking the name given to the dog in the beginning of the game as well as to teach the dog tricks such as \"sit\" or \"roll over\". Players can bring their dogs on walks and to the park if they so choose. They may interact with other players in multi-player by using the DS's wireless linkup. It also uses the DS's internal clock and calendar to allow the dog to grow hungrier or dirtier based on the elapsed time.\n\nNintendogs received critical acclaim. It has an aggregate score of 85% at Game Rankings,[3] and has won many awards, including the 2006 Innovation Award from PC World and Best Handheld Game from the Associated Press. As of March 31, 2015, all versions of Nintendogs combined have sold 23.96 million copies worldwide, making it second on the Nintendo DS best-sellers list, behind only New Super Mario Bros.[4] Because of Nintendogs' success, Nintendo has made several related products, including Nintendogs toys[5] and a series of Nintendogs trading cards.[6] At E3 2010, it was announced a sequel, titled Nintendogs + Cats, would be released for the Nintendo 3DS.","tags":[268435469]},{"id":42126,"cover":{"id":132007,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co2tuv.jpg"},"name":"Magical Chase","platforms":[{"id":6,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"},{"id":86,"name":"TurboGrafx-16/PC Engine"}],"screenshots":[{"id":356080,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc7mr4.jpg"},{"id":356081,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc7mr5.jpg"},{"id":356082,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc7mr6.jpg"},{"id":356083,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc7mr7.jpg"},{"id":356084,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc7mr8.jpg"},{"id":356085,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc7mr9.jpg"}],"summary":"Ripple is a student of magic, and her teacher is a terrifying witch.

The gameplay of DOA2, and all subsequent Dead or Alive games, borrows heavily from the Virtua Fighter series, but makes some key changes that drastically changes the way Dead or Alive is played in comparison to Virtua Fighter. In DOA2, the basis of the entire fighting system is the circular relationship between three types of moves: blows, throws, and holds.The other defining feature of DOA2, aside from blows/throws/holds, is its stun system. In DOA2 many attacks upon hitting will inflict a stun on the opponent. While stunned, the opponent cannot attack, and cannot guard, but they can hold. If the attacker lands a non-knockdown, non-launching attack while the opponent is stunned, the opponent will be re-stunned in a new way, depending on what attack was landed. A major difference between DOA2 and other fighters was in the safety and non-punishability of attacks, both upon hitting and upon being blocked. Most blows in DOA2 can be punished on hit and block by each character's faster throws, making blow-based offense very risky. In addition to the normal rules of juggling, each character also fits into a specific weight category, which affects how the character responds to being launched and being juggled. In DOA2, fights can occur on either water or ice; when a character is on such a surface, all non-knockdown, non-launching attacks will induce a stun on any successful hit. Walls and falls in the middle of stages are everywhere in the game. Many stages are also multi-tiered: to get to other areas of the stage, one character must be knocked off a ledge and fall into the next area. These falls deal usually fairly high damage, but cannot knock the opponent out. Other notable features included introducing CG cutscenes in line with the plot, replacing the original \"Danger Zone\" areas in stages with fully interactive ones, allowing players to juggle each other into walls, propelling characters from landmarks for more damage.","tags":[1,268435460,268435489,536870934,536870973,536870990,536871019,536871076,536871133,536871213,536871420,536871436,536871816,536871881,536871889,536872143,536872339,536872424,536872449,536872587,536872897,536872898,536872983,536873027,536874028,536874039,536874398,536874535,536874572,536874792,536875073,536875151,536875178,536875183,536875198,536875271,536875274,536875281,536875362,536875435,536875456,536875490,536875556,536875716,536875803,536875815,536875833,536875895,536875934,536876069,536876099,536876216,536876235,536876266,536876454,536876719,536876803,536876818,536876823,536876829,536876834,536876854,536876903,536876973,536877016,536877029,536877221,536877406,536877446,536877449,536877778,536877913,536877986,536877987,536878066,536878257,536878562,536879181,536879756,536879786,536879895,536879957,536879988,536880188,536880251,536880441,536880805,536881360,536881410,536881458,536881482,536881578,536882161,536882677,536882678,536882765,536882865,536884026,536884031,536884863,536885022,536886285,536887800,536888179,536889579,536891688,536891946,536895968,536897563,536897564,536897566,536897571,536897572,536897573],"videos":[{"id":42581,"video_id":"BxokNplKzyU"}]},{"id":5092,"aggregated_rating":53.3333333333333,"cover":{"id":5071,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/acvwqjiomqalktet73yf.jpg"},"name":"PDC World Championship Darts 2008","platforms":[{"id":5,"name":"Wii"},{"id":6,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"},{"id":8,"name":"PlayStation 2"},{"id":12,"name":"Xbox 360"},{"id":38,"name":"PlayStation Portable"}],"screenshots":[{"id":28190,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/rvp75zgz5q88javz88vw.jpg"}],"summary":"Go head-to-head with the greatest PDC Champions and be part of the year's most fierce console Championship with PDC World Championship Darts 2008.

Fuji, Mt.

The stages contain a different layout of blocks, some that disappear after being shot, others that do not, and still others that are hidden and can reveal bonuses.\n\nThe stages start with differing numbers and sizes of balloons. The largest balloon divides for the first three times it is popped; after the fourth and smallest balloon is popped it vanishes. Each player starts with a single harpoon. When a balloon is popped, special weapons may drop down.\n\nAt a certain point in the stage, a food item will drop down that is worth several thousand bonus points.\n\nIf a player touches a balloon of any size, the player dies and both players must start the stage again.\n\nWhen both players touch a balloon at the same time, only Player 1 will lose a life but this is somewhat offset because when both players reach a bonus or weapon simultaneously only Player 1 will get it.\n\nPlayers start with 3-5 lives depending on the dip switch setting. Extra lives are also given when certain point totals have been accumulated. The stage ends when all of the balloons are successfully cleared.

In the first mode, the objective is to enter math answers in order to receive points. These questions include addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.\nIn the two player mode, two players control two characters as they race to create a math formula to reach the number shown by Donkey Kong, incorporating platform gameplay. The mechanics are similar to Donkey Kong Junior; players climb vines to reach higher areas in order to collect numbers scattered around the area. In order to complete mathematics problems, players must collect at least three things: the first number, the symbol necessary to reach the number shown by Donkey Kong, and the second number. When the game features a high number, such as 66, players must collect multiple numbers and mathematics symbols in order to reach this. For example, players could choose a nine, a multiplication symbol, and a seven, followed by an addition symbol and a three to reach the number 66. The two player game have two different levels, Calculate A and Calculate B. Calculate B is more challanging, not only the goal is a negative number, but giving players the set number.","tags":[1,34,268435464,536871446,536871830,536872216,536872475,536872594,536873064,536873192,536875046,536875101,536875204,536875434,536875435,536875534,536875637,536875666,536879044]},{"id":150453,"cover":{"id":187904,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co40zk.jpg"},"name":"Shadow Dreams: The Last Thought of Hope","platforms":[{"id":6,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"},{"id":48,"name":"PlayStation 4"},{"id":49,"name":"Xbox One"},{"id":167,"name":"PlayStation 5"}],"screenshots":[{"id":475539,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sca6xf.jpg"},{"id":475540,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sca6xg.jpg"},{"id":475541,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sca6xh.jpg"},{"id":475542,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sca6xi.jpg"},{"id":475543,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sca6xj.jpg"},{"id":475544,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sca6xk.jpg"},{"id":790689,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scgy3l.jpg"},{"id":790690,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scgy3m.jpg"}],"summary":"Explore a world of psychological issues as the embodiment of the last thought of hope to enter a suicidal mind, a fast magic based first person shooter with a strong emphasis on dealing with emotional trauma.","tags":[1,17,19,268435461,268435464,268435468,268435487,268435488,536871043,536871138,536871162,536871199,536871337,536871378,536871945,536872017,536872609,536872796,536872961,536873336,536874169],"videos":[{"id":52820,"video_id":"eyXRJmvrGmw"}]},{"id":33809,"cover":{"id":95137,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co21ep.jpg"},"name":"Nuts!: Battle of the Bulge","platforms":[{"id":6,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"},{"id":14,"name":"Mac"},{"id":39,"name":"iOS"}],"screenshots":[{"id":61807,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/buqk1jlgznkmgynenldx.jpg"},{"id":61808,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/skaofyoyuykqhwpnbyeh.jpg"},{"id":61809,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/oaduwjyzxkwro9iqyyi7.jpg"},{"id":61810,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/x19qcu8yxebak6vluphz.jpg"},{"id":61811,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/s1qoa45nsjlottqbea3a.jpg"}],"summary":"Nuts!: Battle of the Bulge is a Decision Games card game that recreates the famous World War Two battle (16-31 Dec 1944) in which the German Army mounted a surprise attack on the thin U.S. forces deployed in the Ardennes region.","tags":[268435471]},{"id":31344,"cover":{"id":193472,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co45a8.jpg"},"name":"Lifestream - A Haunting Text Adventure","platforms":[{"id":6,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"},{"id":39,"name":"iOS"}],"screenshots":[{"id":47468,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/rwl0cmqwhlabhcedgfxd.jpg"},{"id":47469,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sqepvdvxokyuqjm0jimb.jpg"},{"id":47470,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/joete0p6jh6byqbf0vtc.jpg"},{"id":47471,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/gwulcefgbrzwggx9ilic.jpg"},{"id":47472,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/ovuzwvshkzzkfrnqhd0a.jpg"}],"summary":"Find your missing father and uncover the dark conspiracy surrounding a sacred artifact and an enigmatic brotherhood in this haunting text adventure that combines the best elements of classic interactive fiction and gamebooks.","tags":[268435468,268435487,268435488,536871939]},{"id":96391,"aggregated_rating":75.75,"cover":{"id":111590,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co2e3q.jpg"},"name":"Shenmue I & II","platforms":[{"id":6,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"},{"id":48,"name":"PlayStation 4"},{"id":49,"name":"Xbox One"}],"screenshots":[{"id":210534,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/ypmnvvx803gj1gyri0xz.jpg"},{"id":210535,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/wrgz6cuxuup221b01es2.jpg"},{"id":210536,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/wybx972icikrqj7bmjl2.jpg"},{"id":210537,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/hrjwkzmmvduup8kryzav.jpg"},{"id":210538,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/blsahu1md8tl0aqivdrq.jpg"},{"id":211682,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/lrswstyvvvaqhydj80ws.jpg"}],"summary":"\"Originally released for the Dreamcast in 2000 and 2001, Shenmue I & II is an open world action adventure combining jujitsu combat, investigative sleuthing, RPG elements, and memorable mini-games.

companions.","tags":[1,18,27,33,38,268435461,268435487,536870915,536870926,536870934,536870962,536870969,536870984,536871033,536871041,536871044,536871049,536871079,536871105,536871130,536871133,536871134,536871196,536871213,536871226,536871244,536871262,536871306,536871325,536871470,536871506,536871515,536871626,536871744,536871758,536871784,536871801,536871809,536871835,536871882,536871889,536871904,536871937,536871945,536871971,536872070,536872100,536872114,536872205,536872211,536872225,536872245,536872285,536872315,536872335,536872352,536872371,536872406,536872581,536872582,536872587,536872590,536872611,536872626,536872695,536872715,536872746,536872810,536872840,536872862,536872873,536872883,536872914,536872957,536872983,536873053,536873065,536873066,536873067,536873208,536873249,536873299,536873352,536873449,536873507,536873535,536873591,536873810,536873861,536874398,536874706,536874743,536874813,536874824,536874834,536874897,536874916,536875046,536875047,536875057,536875062,536875073,536875081,536875089,536875094,536875095,536875096,536875098,536875099,536875106,536875107,536875108,536875110,536875111,536875113,536875114,536875127,536875154,536875162,536875178,536875192,536875197,536875199,536875216,536875217,536875219,536875236,536875250,536875251,536875257,536875265,536875271,536875272,536875280,536875281,536875300,536875304,536875314,536875315,536875322,536875326,536875330,536875338,536875356,536875362,536875364,536875372,536875396,536875402,536875414,536875415,536875424,536875437,536875455,536875460,536875464,536875484,536875486,536875490,536875491,536875492,536875498,536875501,536875502,536875504,536875506,536875508,536875521,536875523,536875527,536875537,536875538,536875540,536875546,536875556,536875559,536875564,536875565,536875567,536875570,536875573,536875578,536875579,536875580,536875583,536875590,536875593,536875597,536875609,536875610,536875623,536875642,536875649,536875650,536875660,536875668,536875682,536875689,536875695,536875700,536875719,536875729,536875732,536875735,536875741,536875742,536875743,536875745,536875747,536875764,536875766,536875781,536875782,536875803,536875804,536875808,536875809,536875819,536875820,536875822,536875830,536875831,536875832,536875839,536875868,536875880,536875893,536875895,536875896,536875900,536875903,536875904,536875910,536875923,536875932,536875937,536876029,536876034,536876062,536876070,536876080,536876083,536876097,536876098,536876108,536876109,536876120,536876125,536876126,536876130,536876169,536876176,536876179,536876183,536876190,536876199,536876210,536876211,536876217,536876220,536876221,536876266,536876273,536876280,536876281,536876289,536876302,536876303,536876321,536876329,536876332,536876333,536876336,536876337,536876338,536876348,536876355,536876356,536876369,536876378,536876380,536876384,536876386,536876410,536876412,536876414,536876419,536876423,536876429,536876433,536876434,536876456,536876459,536876461,536876471,536876475,536876476,536876482,536876487,536876498,536876502,536876505,536876509,536876511,536876514,536876530,536876537,536876545,536876546,536876566,536876569,536876575,536876576,536876596,536876606,536876616,536876617,536876621,536876625,536876626,536876641,536876672,536876695,536876703,536876708,536876711,536876723,536876765,536876805,536876811,536876812,536876819,536876823,536876825,536876828,536876832,536876833,536876851,536876853,536876855,536876871,536876875,536876901,536876917,536876938,536876954,536876962,536876968,536876978,536876982,536876983,536876987,536876995,536877000,536877014,536877025,536877026,536877027,536877032,536877035,536877048,536877063,536877109,536877161,536877176,536877179,536877181,536877187,536877207,536877221,536877268,536877275,536877285,536877286,536877293,536877295,536877319,536877322,536877324,536877325,536877331,536877333,536877352,536877363,536877384,536877386,536877394,536877398,536877406,536877409,536877439,536877493,536877565,536877578,536877583,536877604,536877619,536877625,536877628,536877648,536877650,536877664,536877691,536877702,536877726,536877744,536877764,536877801,536877907,536877912,536877919,536877943,536877986,536877998,536878009,536878101,536878215,536878227,536878233,536878247,536878263,536878270,536878277,536878296,536878318,536878363,536878381,536878388,536878394,536878513,536878609,536879025,536879030,536879059,536879062,536879073,536879081,536879160,536879175,536879188,536879582,536879602,536879707,536879711,536879715,536879740,536879761,536879766,536879779,536879788,536879808,536879869,536879873,536879973,536879978,536879979,536880198,536880223,536880415,536880481,536880661,536880670,536880697,536880704,536880711,536880757,536880861,536880866,536880948,536881045,536881068,536881599,536881608,536881624,536881635,536882120,536882297,536882508,536882509,536882510,536882511,536882512,536882513,536882514,536882515,536882516,536882517,536882518,536882519,536882520,536882521,536882522,536882523,536882524,536882525,536882526,536882527,536882528,536882529,536882530,536882531,53688
