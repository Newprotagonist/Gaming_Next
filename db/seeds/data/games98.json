The title may ring a bell thanks to the Super Famicom game of the same name (with its own fan translation provided by Frank Hughes), which, while both looking and playing completely differently to this game, was actually released on the exact same day! \n \nThe aim of this game is to destroy all of the blocks in a level in one punch (after charging the strength of the punch with the A button). The blocks will regenerate after a couple of seconds if you didn’t manage to take them all out at the same time. By pushing and pulling barrels into the correct position - while avoiding enemies - you can force the shockwave from Papuwa’s punch to split off into different directions. By failing to destroy all of the blocks with the first punch, you do actually get the opportunity to collect some items, which can come in handy for boss battles. Those take place on every 5th stage.",

Combos are done with fast key presses or sequential moves, and by taking damage, the fighter gathers magic points that can be used to perform a destructive special attack. Like Virtua Fighter, if a fighter falls from the battle arena, he or she loses from ring out. The usual options such as combat length, number of bouts, difficulty level and auto-block are included.",

Developed by Sensible Software and first released for Amiga in 1992, it featured a zoomed-out bird\u0027s-eye view, editable national, club and custom teams and gameplay utilising a relatively simple and user-friendly control scheme. One of the defining gameplay elements was the aftertouch feature, which enabled effective but unrealistic swerves. The game topped charts such as Amiga Power\u0027s \"All Time Top 100\". The graphic style of the game was used in other Sensible Software games, such as Mega-Lo-Mania, Cannon Fodder and Sensible Golf.",

Your unlikely protagonist, a member of the weak Ruby tribe, turned out to be one of a few survivors of the last cataclysm, a giant avalanche. Your initial personal mission quickly turns into the ultimate search for truth - a search that requires you to climb the fabled grand summit.\n\nYour journey begins when you wake up in a mysterious cave. Struck by the blow of a giant avalanche you and your fellow miners have been washed away into the darkness. You must climb out of this crevasse and head to Pinetown - the once great village at the very foot of the Mountain. There might be your only chance to gather the strength, the gear and the knowledge to begin your ascent of the unknown. Your destination - the Summit - is clear, but the way there is as treacherous as it is fabulous.\n\nAlong your way you will stumble upon characters of all tribes, foreigners and natives to the mountain. You will find climbing equipment that will be essential for your progression - an icepick, a rope and grappling hook, a parachute and many more. You will also encounter great obstacles, mysteries and enemies which will make your journey even more epic.\n\nThis game combines the joy of exploring a large interconnected world with fluid and unique platforming and engaging puzzles.",

And now man wants to reclaim it. \n \nSpecially trained ecological engineers, called Environmental Purifiers (EPs), are being sent to earth to undo centuries of damage. Is it too late? You\u0027re about to find out. Because you are one of our best EPs. \n \nYou\u0027ll enter the earth\u0027s hazardous atmosphere in a plasmic hoversphere. Then begin by destroying radioactive nodes and obelisks. You\u0027ll build land and fly across oceans. Avoiding mutant strains of experimental species, like poisonous Viral Trees and deadly Eco-Eggs. Or watch out for wandering Necromancers and sweeping air purifiers. \n \nThere have been others before you and we may as well tell you the truth: no one has returned alive. But you can do it. Because you have one thing the others didn\u0027t: a love for the Earth. \n \nExplore all 360 degrees of this living landscape. See the sky evolve from day to night. Watch plants grow and move, painting the landscape with their poison. Even when you\u0027re not moving, everything else in this animated 3-D world is. \n \nNode: The collector nodes funnel radioactive energy to the obelisk; so they must all be destroyed first. You may even need to create land bridges linking the nodes and obelisk, in order to \"short circuit\" the nodes. \n \nEco-Egg: The Eco-Egg was genetically cultivated to trap poisons in a bulbous flower. Which it does, until disturbed. Then its deadly poison pod explodes. \n \nViral Tree: This strain of Viral Trees protects itself by poisoning the land around it. It\u0027s constantly growing and forever inching its way towards anything with body heat. Leaving a wake of poison in its path. \n \nNecromancer: This was once an environmental Purifier. Now mutated into an aimless Necromancer, a lost soul who hovers around beaches, destroying coastlines. \n \nAircleaner: This whirling dervish is actually a highly sophisticated and extremely effective Air Cleaner called the 900-B. Problem is, it\u0027ll clean up everything. Including innocent EPs. \n \nObelisk: Each archipelago is home to a single obelisk that send out ultra-high doses of UV and GAMMA radiation. These are the heart of the problem- and must be destroyed before the island can be purged.",

It compresses a galaxy-spanning starship adventure into the space of a single sitting, but as the game world is randomly generated each time you play, you will keep coming back for more. There is enough variety in items, aliens and special encounters that you will always discover something new - no two sessions play the same.\n\nSea of Stars begins in the Glory star system, in an area of space known as the Purple Void for its colorful nebular clouds. The long-isolated Terran colony of Hope has discovered the secret of faster-than-light travel, and an age of interstellar adventure has begun. Choose your starship and blast off into the Infinite Space in search of fame and fortune! Travel from star to star, explore planets and discover strange lifeforms and artifacts left behind by ancient empires. Find technology to upgrade your ship and gain allies to grow your flotilla. Encounter bizarre and delightful alien races, trade with them or blow them up - the decision is yours. And sometimes, you will face an existential threat to all life in the sector, and get to save the world.",

    "summary": "This game tells the story of seven long-time friends. How they grew closer or further apart as they got older. The story is presented using a blog-like interface. \n \nThe protagonist, Atemiya Shinobu, who was raised at a certain facility since young, had no one around him that could be called \"friend\". Being that way, the first thing he started doing after leaving the facility with his sister - Chidori - was to find and make friends. \n \nBenio Azusa, a tomboyish girl who lived nearby. \n \nHondou Sayaka, a quiet yet sharp-tongued girl who was in charge of raising the pets at school just like him. \n \nTsukamoto Youko and Itsuki, a pair of siblings who belong to a prestigious family around the area. \n \nHiguchi Shouji, a boy he knew by being attracted to by the similarities they both share. \n \nIzuki Fueko, a girl he met by chance. \n \nTogether with Shinobu, they were a group of seven. Just like that, each and every one of them, who had never experienced the joy of having friends, was able to meet each other and become companions. The story begins in a quiet town colored by dusk. Around the seven friends, there were understanding, empathy, conflict, and what\u0027s more, fleeting love of adolescence. It was a friendship that could last forever. \n \nSuch a simple happiness should have... lasted forever. \n \nThat was until the \"enemy\" appeared. \n \nThe \"enemy\" had disturbed the peaceful relationship of the seven people. \nShinobu could not forgive that. He could not forgive the one that injures his companions, nor could he forgive the one that hurts another one\u0027s hearts. And when he realized all that, the world they reside in changed, rather then becoming the new world that it should have... they had arrived at the \"sanctuary\" instead. \n \nThis is a story that describes the heart. \n \nA story that describes the thing located in the farthest end of a heart.",

Join JC, Justin, Chris, Joey, and Lance in the most daring adventure the group has ever embarked upon, helping them get to the show before curtain time. Of course, life is never easy for these highly sought-after recording artists, so you\u0027ll have to help them with such challenges as making snacks and running errands in a stretch limousine. If you can accomplish these feats, you might even get to help the band warm up for their big show with a friendly game of hackey-sack! Packed with challenges and dangerous distractions, the game\u0027s real appeal is its goofball spirit and dedication to the band itself. Each of the group\u0027s members\u0027 distinct personality shines through, making this an awesome title for anyone who likes NSYNC. They might not be the most likely of video game heroes, but have you ever seen a more handsome bunch of characters?",

The primary objective of the game is to acquire the \"Master Flesh\" from each tower\u0027s master beast, as this is the only way to break the curse. Players only have a certain amount of time in the towers before Elena\u0027s curse worsens (displayed as a meter on the player\u0027s screen) and the player is forced to exit the tower in order to give Elena flesh; thus it is important for the player to take shortcuts in order to reach the top as well as to go back.",

The game follows the same general path as the movie, and includes media straight from the film. Present in the game are Greek, Persian, Indian and Egyptian forces, with a campaign for each. The hybrid 2D/3D engine (2D units, 3D terrain - also used in Cossacks 2: Napoleonic Wars) allows for a very large number of troops on the field. This is used to good effect, as battles can easily contain hundreds of units. Finally, multiplayer and skirmish levels are available, and the soundtrack (of the game and the movie) is by the composer Vangelis.",

Olympus, you must first defeat some of the most powerful deities in the Greek pantheon. Such a task would be impossible for a puny mortal, but you wield the raw power of the universe in your hands, for you are destined to become a god! Learn to shatter the sky with lightning and shower the earth with fire. Summon heroes to aid your people, and plagues to destroy the enemy. Call forth tornadoes, hurricanes, tidal waves, and columns of flame. \n \nThe second installment of Bullfrog\u0027s Populous series follows the path set by its predecessor and remains one of the greatest god-games ever created. Populous 2: Trials of the Olympian Gods vastly improves the formula by adding new spells, better quality sound and graphics, and a character development system that allows you to customize your divine powers in any way you want. You really can’t go wrong with a game where you can kill gods, obliterate entire continents, and strike down upon the infidels with great vengeance and furious anger. Just as Peter Molyneux, those things simply never get old.",

On the other hand, when terror level is too low, the dictator can replace you with a more appropriate person.

    "summary": "The first naval game to bring both base building and combat on the same map. \n \nFlotilla WWII strives to fill in a gap in the naval enthusiast\u0027s collection. There have been games where you command one ship, there have been others where you command a few or a fleet, and there have been 4X games in WWII, but never yet have we had the opportunity to build a base on one end of the map while we\u0027re simultaneously fighting a battle on another side and buying a new ship hoping we got it in time to get there and turn the tide of the battle. \n \nIn Flotilla WWII you will be building factories to increase your production, ships and aircraft to repel the enemy, ports to repair your ships, airfields to build your planes, and AA guns to protect your assets - all in the same map. \n \nThe game plays out as a turn-based strategy game, where you bring in your new units and assign them destination and target orders which they carry out when you end your turn. You will be balancing between building a strong economy and a strong military force, while your choice of ships will also be crucial. Will you try to gain the upper hand by rushing in small, fast ships, in an attempt to cripple the enemy\u0027s economy in a hit \u0026 run raid, or will you build up your forces silently, ready to unleash long-ranged carriers and cumbersome but powerful and durable battleships onto the enemy? Is investing in a port to repair your ships worth the resources, or are they better spent on more units? Will you firmly take over one island at a time, or will you go straight to the nearest enemy island, striking fast but hard from safety? You can test your strategies against your friends in multiplayer hotseat, or against a simple but very persistent and aggressive AI in noumerous randomly generated island maps, from 16x16 tiles (~5 minutes of play time) to enormous 256x256 tile maps (~2 hours of play time) as best you see fit.",

This is also one of the first two titles by Nazca, the other being the popular Metal Slug before \u0026 between being acquired by SNK. \n \nThe game is a fast paced, arcade-style golf game. Players choose from two game modes, stroke play for one or two players, and match play for two players only. \n \nCompeting on one of four fictional golf courses located in the United States, Japan, Australia and Germany, players choose from one of six players with different attributes: \n \n \"Young Hero\" (George Spinner, USA) \n \"Technician\" (Thomas Stewart, United Kingdom) \n \"Veteran\" (Frank Adams, Australia) \n \"Shot Maker\" (Robert Landolt, Germany) \n \"Power Golfer\" (Fernando Almeida, Brazil) \n \"Putt Master\" (Toyoshige Takeno, Japan) \n \nUnlike many golf games of the era which used a two-click swing system to determine the hook or slice of the ball, Neo Turf Masters uses a single click for the power of the shot, and a second for the height of the shot; hook and slice are selected with buttons B and C before making the shot. This makes the game much easier to pick up and play well than its contemporaries, but it compensates for this reduced difficulty with fiendish (if somewhat unrealistic) course layouts and highly variable wind.",

To find a pet, the player will first need to gather information, and go outdoors to find and befriend animals. Animals, and sometimes items, are found by moving the stylus in specific places. Once an animal is found, an exclamation mark appears and it will come out, and the player can now try catching it. To do so, food and various items will be used. Some strategies, such as waiting a few turns for a shy animal to approach by itself may also be needed. When a task is done, the player will get an allowance."

Despite the puzzles are item based the game features no classic inventory system: Rydec won\u0027t take an item until it is directly needed for the next puzzle. If he has all items needed he uses them himself. The only things he always carry is a multi tool with three functions, e.g. as screwdriver and a PDA which shows the next task and optionally gives hints. Another help function is the possibility to mark all hot spots on the screen. The puzzles itself often feature multiple solutions. Another speciality is that all the conversations are automatic. Despite the dark scenario the dialogues are also humorous and long - if the player doesn\u0027t like listening to them he can use an option to shorten them.",

It\u0027s also unclear how the Lemuria 7 has returned and why it has been seriously damaged.  \n \nIn Lemuria: Lost in Space, you play as Abrix - the robot with AI that may operate in extreme temperatures, high levels of radiation and that yields weapon and hacking modules in order to explore the whole ship.  \n \nUnique gameplay : \nAbrix has an ability to overrun security systems. The unique hacking mini-game will challenge your math, geographic and logical thinking skills. There is no time to check Wikipedia - every mistake costs you valuable resources!  \n \nAbrix has a special software that allows him to upgrade himself during the mission. You need to be very careful - if you run out of batteries or an anti-radiation cloak, the mission is aborted and the game is over.  \n \nDangerous exploration: \nIn order to explore over 100 rooms of the spaceship, you\u0027ll need to solve dozens of puzzles, find valuable resources for the robot and fight with security turrets and other enemies patrolling the ship. \n \nSolving puzzles not only rewards you with priceless resources, but also uncovers the story of the lost crew of Lemuria 7. The level of challenge depends on difficulty - so choose wisely or you\u0027ll need to start from scratch.\"",

The name is derived from a partnership between Rockstar and DUB Magazine, which features heavily in the game in the form of DUB-sponsored races and DUB-customized vehicles as prizes. \n \nPlayers race through open world recreations of San Diego, Atlanta, and Detroit listening to 98 licensed music tracks that include hip-hop, rock, and more.[citation needed] The game features a number of graphical views after the player crashes into certain objects, or travels across particular stretches of road. There is also the ability to customize a player\u0027s vehicle. Other than modifying the external looks, the vehicle\u0027s performance can also be improved (with the exception of all \u0027A\u0027 Class vehicles except motorcycles).",

    "summary": "SkyGunner is a 3rd person flight combat game, with its emphasis on action. Players choose to take the role of either Ciel, Copain or Femme, each with their own campaign and unique flying abilities and special skill. Players can turn the plane\u0027s direction up, down, left and right, perform barrel rolls, use afterburners and breaking. Weaponry is handled by a complex system of targeting, with involves two types: \"Look Targeting\" and \"Weapon Lock\". Look Targeting simply assigns a particular enemy as the center of the camera and can be switched between at any time. The player must still maneuver near the enemy and target them with the cross hairs in order to fire on them. Depending on the secondary weapon selected, players can roll the cross hairs over the wing leader of an enemy group or the sequentially lead gun on a battleship, allowing the player to instantly target multiples from that group. \n \nThe primary weapon of each airplane is a machine gun which fires straight ahead. More destructive secondary weapons are also available, and include Fireworks Missiles which create area explosions, Dog Missiles which slow and/or immobilize targets and Cross Missiles which stick to targets and need to be shot by a machine gun to detonate. Copain also has his own weapon, the Pumpkin Bomb which is a big destructive bomb. These secondary weapons are automatically replenished with the destruction of chains of enemies and/or combos. Chains/Combos are also the way to activate score multipliers, which affect the amount of money won in each mission. Ciel, Copain and Femme are continually in competition throughout the game and often bonuses (such as faster engines) are given to the character with the highest score in specific missions. Bonus scores are also awarded for specific mission events.",

Welcome to a new experience in gameplay and battle your way through a series of devastating space feuds, for supremacy across the universe. Unleash your firepower and launch an arsenal of special attacks to destroy the enemy.\n\nExplore the galaxy and distant constellations, where resources, new life forms and fearsome adversaries abound. Destroy your opponents with lasers and missiles, along with a dozen special attacks and weapons you can earn through mining and search for life mini games.\n\nPlace spaceships in combat formation at the battlefront, keeping in mind that the vulnerable and missile attack ships, should be positioned behind the stronger crafts that are equipped with lasers and abundant health points, in order to engage the enemy and withstand attacks that would otherwise destroy inferior spaceships. When all the crafts of either opposing fleet have been destroyed, the battle is over.\n\nIf you win, but have damaged crafts, return to the nearest base and mobilise available ships for the next mission. As the game progresses, depending on your leadership status, you have the option of selecting up to four spaceships with different abilities in every space station and a total of six in battle formation.\nEach spaceship can be upgraded by collecting experience points during combat. The current status is denoted by rank signs. Ships with more experience can withstand greater damage and deliver more powerful hits.\n\nThe scan button helps detect resources, which can be found by scanning and mining different sectors of the galaxy. Collecting crystals is strategically essential, because special weapons cannot be acquired without them. Without these special weapons, you will be incapable of completing specific missions.\nThere are three types of crystals and their various combinations are required for special attacks. Use the crafting system in space stations to create the sort of crystal needed for the desired weapon.\n\nThe search for life will grant you life points. While claiming life points, you will get promotions with rewards and additional crystals.\nEngage in one-on one battles and lead your mother-ship against the enemy\u0027s. The battle of the mother-ship is a turn based card collision. The results of all mother-ship battles can be tracked in the space base Hall of fame panel, where your rank is displayed.",

The game features a total of 96 different dishes.\n\nEach minigame represents a different activity in the meal preparation, such as mixing, frying, or chopping the provided ingredients. The minigame mechanics themselves range from quickly drawing parallel lines in order to chop items, to a rhythm game where ingredients are added to a skillet or the heat is adjusted at precisely the right time. In many cases, players must look at the top screen of the DS for guidance on what to do next and then perform the task on the bottom screen. If the player makes a serious blunder or time expires without sufficient progress being made, that step in the cooking process is considered a failure. When this happens, a graphic of an angry \"Mama\" with flames erupting from her eyes is displayed, along with the caption \"Don\u0027t worry, Mama will fix it!\".",

The players receive points for successfully ending a discipline. For each gold medal you get 5 points, for each silver medal 3 points and one point for each bronze medal. The player with the most points wins the game.\nEpyx has secured a license from the Olympic Commitee of the United States for The Games - Winter Edition and The Games - Summer Edition.\nThe disciplines are partially divided into several sections in which the player has to do another action with the joystick.",

    "summary": "A terrorist group calling itself the Crying Lions is about to take over the world with its mighty satellite and Jean-Luc Cougar is the only one who can stop it. As Jean-Luc, a covert operative working for the Strategic Covert Actions Team, you are responsible for taking back a Lions-controlled base and regaining power of the satellite. Some of the weapons you\u0027ll have to acquire and use to defeat the terrorists are handguns, shotguns, and machine guns, though you\u0027ll also need to access such materials as explosives, detectors, flashlights and medical kits in order to succeed. A refreshing take on the traditional action game, WINBACK requires as much stealth and strategy as it does reflexes and use of weaponry. The game features six different multiplayer modes, supporting up to four players: Death Match, Lethal Tag, Quick Draw, Cube Hunt, Team Battle, and Point Match. You select your difficulty level and you can even start off in a Tutorial mode to get the controls down.",
