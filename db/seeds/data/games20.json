    "summary": "Left 4 Dead is a cooperative first-person shooter video game with survival horror elements, developed by Turtle Rock Studios and published by Valve Corporation. The game uses Valve\u0027s proprietary Source engine, and is available for Microsoft Windows, Xbox 360 and Mac OS X. Development on the game was completed on November 13, 2008, and two versions were released digitally: A downloadable digital version, released on November 17, 2008, and a digital retail disc version, with a release date determined by region. The digital retail disc version was released in North America and Australia on November 18, 2008; and in Europe and Japan on November 21, 2008. \n \nSet during the aftermath of an apocalyptic pandemic, the game pits its four protagonists—dubbed the \"Survivors\"—against hordes of the infected. There are four game modes: a single-player mode in which allied characters are controlled by AI; a four-player, co-op campaign mode; an eight-player online versus mode; and a four-player survival mode. In all modes, an artificial intelligence (AI), dubbed the \"Director\", controls level pacing and item placements, in an attempt to create a dynamic experience and increase replay value. \n \nLeft 4 Dead was well received by the industry media upon its release, with praise given for its replay value, focus on cooperative play, and movie-like experience. Several criticisms were aimed at limited level selection and the lack of a narrative. The game has won several publication awards, as well as distinctions from the Academy of Interactive Arts \u0026 Sciences and British Academy of Film and Television Arts. As was done with Team Fortress 2, Valve supplemented the game with free downloadable content. The first, called the \"Survival Pack\", was released on April 21, 2009. The second piece of DLC was charged for on Xbox Live and came in the form of a new Campaign entitled \"Crash Course,\" released for both the PC and Xbox 360 on September 29, 2009. \n \nThe popularity of the game led to the development of a sequel, Left 4 Dead 2, which was released November 17, 2009. Left 4 Dead 2 was released on Mac OS X via Steam on October 5, 2010, and the original Left 4 Dead was released for the Mac soon after on October 28, 2010. The Mac version of Left 4 Dead 2 incorporated a new map for both Left 4 Dead and Left 4 Dead 2, called \"The Sacrifice\". Eventually all Left 4 Dead campaigns were ported over to Left 4 Dead 2 and allowing for cross-platform support between Windows and Mac versions."

The developer of this game is unknown, as the only company shown before the intro screen is Hakuhodo. However, given that Himikogen: Renge was developed by Chime Corporation, it is unlikely that Hakuhodo actually developed Mad Panic Coaster.\n\nIn Mad Panic Coaster, you control a boy and a girl (perhaps a brother and sister?) as they sit in a roller coaster car and go through 15 hellish roller coasters. How these roller coasters even got past safety testing is unknown, as they don\u0027t have any rails or barriers of any sort. It\u0027s up to you to steer the roller coaster car using the d-pad to make sure it stays on the track. The roller coasters also have various monsters, traps, and jumps to avoid. To do this, you use X to jump. Hitting Square will make the girl throw some sort of yellow ball projectile that explodes at a long range, while hitting Circle will make the boy throw that same type of projectile at a shorter range. Falling off the track or getting hit by something will cost you health, and once you run out, you must start the level all over again. Once you make three laps around the track, a rainbow with the words \"lucky\" form around you as they come to a stop, and you move on to the next level. Every three roller coasters, a boss will be fought after completing the third lap. This boss is similar to the regular enemies, except that they take many more hits to kill. To defeat them, you has to either throw enough projectiles at them or survive another three laps.",

Starting out with a few rudimentary implements and very little money, you begin the arduous task of reviving your grandfather\u0027s farm and thereby claiming your place as its rightful heir. \n \nPlayers are given three years to achieve this goal. A year consists of four seasons, each of which lasts 30 days. Different crops can be planted each season, but before the seeds can be planted, the land must be cleared and then the soil tilled. \n \nSeeds must also be watered until the fruit or vegetable matures. Once the crops are ready for harvest, they can be placed in a shipping bin where they\u0027ll be collected and paid for. In addition to farming, players will interact with local villagers and partake in seasonal events such as the Tomato Festival and Fireworks Display. As more money is earned, players can expand their farm and begin to raise livestock such as chickens and cows.",

Eventually the towns started to disagree with each other on whose town had the best cooking cuisine. As the villagers became more obnoxious with each other, the Harvest Goddess became more annoyed with them. One day she finally put her foot down and collapsed the tunnel between the towns, cutting them off from each other. Now the only interaction the towns have with each other is at their cooking festival, where their cooking conflict continues four times per season.\n\nAs a new farmer, you are eager to start your new life at one of the towns but a freak travel accident makes you to forget what town you originally were going to live in! Listen to each mayor\u0027s story, hear about each town, and then decide where you want to start your new farm life.",

    "summary": "In the 21st century, a dreadful virus wiped out millions. The vaccine was found, but at the time the world was engulfed into chaos. A new world order emerged, splitting the world into two distinct yet dependent worlds: Above and Below. The world Above reflects a chrome city, a high-rise, high-tech metropolis served by elevators and elevated freeways. A place for hardworkers and law-abiding people. On the contrary to Above, the world Below, which is the product of earthquake damages, is a subterranean network of labour colonies. Those who are not wanted Above for one reason or another are sent Below. One day, now veteran Headhunter, Jack Wade, took a call to investigate an intrusion to the upper levels. Facing the trespasser, Jack saw a potential in the girl and instead of turning her in, he gave her a second chance... to become his apprentice. Jack is back, but this time, he\u0027s not alone but accompanied by his sidekick Leeza X. Together, they will face whatever threat lurks from the world Below. The gameplay is set in 3rd-person view with ability to rotate camera or set it behind your back at the single click. Headhunter\u0027s main accessory is IRIS (Intelligent Realtime Information Scanner). Once you get the IRIS, you\u0027ll be able to scan every item just by pointing the gun at it, or use the scanner in 1st-person view which will let you examine the surroundings in more detail. Also, IRIS will provide you with a full 3D map info even displaying the enemies so you can avoid them or use stealth if necessary. Enemies will hear you running and shooting, so if you decide to take an action, be aware that they will surround you and launch a team strike at you from all the sides. You only effective aid against them, beside your weapon, of course, is the ability to perform a roll or lean against the walls and fire from the corners, although aiming itself may not be easy as your hand will not be steady while on the move or panicking.",

Overall, this is a very enjoyable addition to the series which has the same fun and interesting atmosphere as the original.",

Although the Battle of the Bulge is ground that has been visited by wargamers before, it has never been done with this level of fidelity and historical accuracy. The most advanced and realistic model of command decision-making implemented to date in a commercial wargame, combined with thorough historical research on the battlefields and forces involved in this campaign sets Command Ops: Battles from the Bulge apart from the competition. \n \nSet during the hard fighting of the Battle of the Bulge, Command Ops lets gamers assess, plan, order and react at the operational level just like a real Corps, Division and Brigade commander. Hundreds of hours of gameplay await armchair generals who will be challenged to fight their way across 27 scenarios that stretch from the initial German surprise offensive to the powerful Allied counter-attack. \n \nCommand Ops: Battles from the Bulge also sports some of the most advanced and impressive AI ever devised in an operational-level wargame! It is your choice whether to manage every detail of your army, or have the friendly AI manage the war on a lower level while you plan the larger scale maneuvers designed to make short work of your enemy. Just as a historical commander, you can choose where you need to step in and when you need to stand back and let your subordinates do their jobs. \n \nThe enemy AI will use its skill to launch well-timed and coordinated strikes as it probes your lines for weakness while realistically reacting to your movements! In addition, for the enthusiastic mod community awaiting Command Ops, powerful tools like MapMaker and ScenMaker allow for the creation of maps and scenarios further adding to already near limitless replayability.",

It is a way that can make the player tense for not knowing where the monster is and even more, for the aggravating player being blind.",

It includes the large underwater world of Oceanus, the Egyptian-flavoured and hot desert of Stigya, the even hotter and hellish Volcanus with lots of lava, and the flying islands of Aerus. But the civilization of Atlantis has long been wiped from the planet, and now archaeologists are searching the ruins. The inhabitants of Atlantis have, however, created some sort of obstacle course, which stood the test of time. The players are now able to take these \"Trials of Atlantis\", journeying the lost lands and battling terrifying creatures, to find out about the true magic and power of Atlantis. \n \nThe new area is targeted at high-level characters, considering that a character has to be at least Level 40 to begin with the first trial. Further, the lands of Atlantis are accessible from every realm, but every realm has its \"own\" Atlantis, so there are no Player vs. Player fights. \n \nThe Addon also contains one new race for each of the three realms (The half-ogres for Albion, the Shars for Hibernia and the Frostalfs for Midgard) and an even more improved graphics engine, mainly giving players better textures and new water effects.",

    "summary": "First of all I want to thank you for taking the time to visit this page. And please, leave me your comments and suggestions and concerns. For me they are fundamental, so that together we can give shape to this project and improve it day by day. \nHaving said that, I tell you a little about this project that I have started to develop with a lot of love because it brings together my two great hobbies, 3D design and writing. This graphic novel, seeks to tell the story and adventures of Bennett and the inhabitants of the village of Nemerion and their relationships, and season them with a little sex. At the moment there are 12 characters in total, most of them appear in the first chapter and some in the following chapters. I don\u0027t want to tell you much, I would like you to discover it... \nI wish to think that the novel has a balance, between History, dialogue and Sexual content, I know that it is something difficult to achieve, but I would like to be able to maintain this balance throughout the novel, and I hope that you with your comments, tell me what you think, as well as if it lacks or has more than one characteristic in particular. Although I already have a definite idea of where the novel will go and its stories, I would love to improve it together even more, 2 heads think more than 1 hahaha. \nMy plan at the moment is to be able to publish a chapter per month (if my current work allows it, since I mainly dedicate a little time every night, when I come back from work, and on weekends, as much as I can). Each month I will be improving aspects of the game, as well as developing in depth the personality and history of each character of the novel. Right now the bottleneck is given with the PC I work with, which does not allow me to render the images of the novel (it takes me an average time of 12 Hs each image, which makes it infeasible to do the work of rendering with my current PC), I can only do the layout of the images, thanks to the help of two Friends: Miguel and Gonzalo (thanks guys), who lent me their Pc\u0027s, remotely I do the work of rendering, and thus the whole project has begun to come to life. From now on my short term objective is to be able to change the PC in order to be able to make the rendering work faster and to be able to have a better quality in the images and videos of the novel. \nAs for the novel itself, I have the idea of being able to add in the lapse of the first 3 chapters: \n● An inventory, which will allow Bennett\u0027s interactions with the other characters as well as with the environment itself to be expanded. \n● A map of the village, and with it the possibility of moving freely through the village. \n● A character card, which will collect and show all the attributes of Bennett (Sexual Orientation, exploits, memories. Etc) \n● A Personal Diary of Bennett, which will show and detail our relationships with the rest of the characters in the novel \n● Videos, this point depends exclusively on whether I can change my PC, but it is something that I would like to include (I already have a video layout, but for the rendering times, I am unable to create it). \nAnd in the long run, I would like to add: Predefined Missions and Adventures that directly impact the development of Bennett\u0027s history. And to be able to launch the novel also for cell phones. \nFinal words: I hope with all my heart that you like this project and everyone can enjoy it as I am enjoying doing it, so I have decided that EVERYONE can enjoy this novel without paying. But I\u0027m not going to lie to you: I also would like to be able to get some money, or at least to be able to recover the invested one, clearly I´m not trying to get rich with this project, only to be able to recover some of the money spend. Some things, like the textures of the 3D models, the storage in the cloud to render the images remotely, or the translation of the texts (I am from Argentina and English is not my native language), have a cost, and from my heart I tell you that it is worth every penny spent on this novel, but of course, it wouldn´t be bad if I can recover some of the money spent hahaha. Just say goodbye to you with a big hug and thank you for being part of this project which is so important to me. Hug",

The first title in the series, Jet de GO!, was released on PlayStation in 2000 and its sequel, simply titled \"Jet de GO! 2\", was released on PlayStation 2 in 2002.\n\nJust like its predecessors, the game allows the player to take the captain\u0027s chair in the cockpit of a commercial airliner making flights to and from major Japanese cities such as Tokyo, Osaka and Sapporo. The game features a variety of airplanes such as the Boeing B747, B777 and B767, different weather and daytime conditions and flight plans. The player can choose between three game modes: Flight, Trial and Replay.\n\nSince the game is endorsed by Japan Airlines, a real world airline, it is not actually possible to \"crash\" an airplane. Collisions with the ground are shown in a simplified fashion where the plane simply stops once it touches down, resulting in a \"Game Over\" screen.\n\nAlthough the game was only released in Japan, it features partially English menus.",

Now as a working captain of a cargo vessel, deeply in debt and in love with alcohol, he\u0027s about to embark to an adventure of lifetime. \n \nThe Gameplay \n \nGameplay of StarFight VI consists of three integral parts: problem solving, combat and space exploration. In order to beat the game, you\u0027ll need sharp wits as well as an itchy trigger finger. \n \nThere is a complete freedom of movement in SF6, no missions are restricted to a small, confined region of space. This freedom often gives several different tactical options of approach to hazardous situation, but it also forces player to consider his actions much more carefully and relate them to available resources.",

Powerball is a game consisting of a hybrid of sports such as American football, soccer and rugby. You play on an 100 yard field trying to score on the opposing team. Scoring consists of either running into your opponent\u0027s end zone holding the powerball for a touchdown or kicking the ball into your opponent\u0027s net to score a goal. Goals are worth 1 point, and touchdowns are worth 3 points. The game modes are 1 or 2 player exhibition play, and 1 or 2 player league play. League play allows you to use bonus points, and distribute them to your teammates to improve their statistics.",

    "summary": "Kirby\u0027s Super Star Stacker is the official English title given to a puzzle Kirby game that was originally released on Japan\u0027s Super Famicom system on February 1, 1998. It is a remake of Kirby\u0027s Star Stacker, which is known in Japan under exactly the same name as the remake. The game was originally released as a new title for the Nintendo Power flash RAM service, but was released in standard cartridge form a year later. It was intended for international release, but the SNES\u0027s lifespan ended in North America and Europe before the game could be localized in either region. The standard cartridge release of the game also came out in the exact year of the SNES\u0027s discontinuation in North America, further compounding its isolation. The game was the final title in the Kirby series officially published for Super Famicom.",

    "summary": "Sonic Robo Blast 2, abbreviated as SRB2, is a fan game for Windows and DOS platforms. It is a 3D platformer developed by a group called Sonic Team Junior, using a modified version of the Doom Legacy source port of Doom, to allow for such things as optional analog control and true room-over-room (something not possible in the standard Doom engine), as well as the standard gameplay elements Sonic games are known for. It has been in the works since 1998 and is currently nearing completion, though several parts of the game are still missing.\n\nSonic Robo Blast 2 is closely inspired by the original 2D Sonic games for the Genesis and attempts to recreate a game with this style in 3D, though it also borrows elements from the current Sonic games, such as Sonic\u0027s signature Air Spin Attack. Entirely original to SRB2 is its Multiplayer mode, a variation of classic first-person shooter games with Sonic elements. Due to being built with a modified Doom Legacy engine, the game is also very easily customizable. Custom levels, characters and even source code modifications can be created with the help of external editors.",
