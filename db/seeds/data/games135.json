Like in other life simulation games with artificial intelligence, the creatures can't be commanded directly and must learn behavior patterns through repeated actions. The Norns can get sick or exhausted and eventually die, and one of the main tasks is to manage the colony to avoid their demise, ensuring that all its inhabitants are well-fed and healthy by eating fruits and consuming medicinal herbs. A series of meters at the bottom of the screen show the population status.\n\nThe game takes place in space, inside a giant station with a domed ceiling protecting a closed ecosystem. The main objective is to open all the rooms, by ordering a Norn to carry a key to unlock a door or passage. Deeper levels have aggressive enemies and poisonous plants that have to be avoided by the Norns. There are blue stars scattered throughout the scenery, and the creatures can be trained to fetch and store them inside a machine, generating a new key after twenty-five stars. Norns can breed and lay eggs, producing offspring that takes some minutes to reach maturity.","tags":[268435469]},{"id":27420,"cover":{"id":126316,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co2pgs.jpg"},"name":"Ashes of Creation","platforms":[{"id":6,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}],"screenshots":[{"id":43298,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/lqd9vctpznz78blcrvoa.jpg"},{"id":43299,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/t8z4yxvypayz2a03cfc0.jpg"},{"id":43300,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/liwmhdcnl9k2mrpsevj3.jpg"},{"id":43301,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/m63ad9rhu8gckpck6qa8.jpg"},{"id":43302,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/tojghoupfzwz0qx8nzdv.jpg"}],"summary":"Ashes of Creation is a unique take on the MMO experience.

Our only hope is a little yellow tank armed with some mighty big guns. The sentient Tiny Tank was originally created to appease a public that feared the mindless violence waged by larger war-robots, but he was soon destroyed by one of those jealous automatons at the beginning of the robot revolution 100 years ago. Almost destroyed, at least.\n\nThanks to nano-technology, hundreds of microscopic \"Fix-It Crabs\" went to work and Tiny Tank was slowly rebuilt. Now he alone stands against the threat of the cruel MuTank and his deadly robot minions, who have all but erased human civilization from the planet's surface. The spunky little tank will need luck, strategy, and all the futuristic firepower he can get his treads on to save the human race.","tags":[1,27,536871262,536872019,536872733,536875122,536875199,536875404,536880648,536884031,536884032,536884863]},{"id":153862,"cover":{"id":173310,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co3pq6.jpg"},"name":"Earth Marines","platforms":[{"id":48,"name":"PlayStation 4"},{"id":49,"name":"Xbox One"},{"id":130,"name":"Nintendo Switch"}],"screenshots":[{"id":505310,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scatwe.jpg"},{"id":505312,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scatwg.jpg"},{"id":505315,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scatwj.jpg"},{"id":505318,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scatwm.jpg"},{"id":505320,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scatwo.jpg"},{"id":505322,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scatwq.jpg"},{"id":505326,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scatwu.jpg"}],"summary":"Earth Marines - a dynamic top down shooter in which you need to save the planet from dangerous zombie - brain eaters!","tags":[1,268435461,268435464,268435488]},{"id":42497,"cover":{"id":161218,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co3gea.jpg"},"name":"Metal Marines","platforms":[{"id":5,"name":"Wii"},{"id":6,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"},{"id":19,"name":"Super Nintendo Entertainment System (SNES)"},{"id":41,"name":"Wii U"}],"screenshots":[{"id":165407,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/bcivdxe2rylzpzbcahkv.jpg"},{"id":165408,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/vfsbuef9myh8rxpgypek.jpg"},{"id":165409,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/kfcymiytr8g0ufky7eyi.jpg"},{"id":165410,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/ucfc3ce49cgkk8mes4mp.jpg"},{"id":165411,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/ag7zrlfclx1yqb4xmwl6.jpg"},{"id":165412,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/f1czu3sqjgzp4rwcnwu4.jpg"}],"summary":"Metal Marines is an isometric strategy game. Controlling one side of a conflict, the player must wage a campaign across several islands to defeat Zorgeuf and his lieutenants. The player controls logistics of the base to ensure that there are the necessary assets to wage war. On each map, the player places three underground command bases, if all of these are destroyed the battle is lost. The player must manage the resources of their money to construct new buildings or upgrade existing facilities on the map. Different buildings include Energy Plants, Factories, Economic Centers, Radar systems, Anti-Aircraft missiles, fake buildings and fake HQ bases, mine fields, gun pods, missile launchers, metal marine hangers and even ICBMs. At any time, the player may order an attack and choose which assets to fire at the opponent. Missiles, Metal Marines carriers and ICBMs all use different levels of fuel. Metal Marines once deployed in an area will automatically fire rifles at nearby targets or engage even closer targets in melee attacks. Gunpods, while stationary, will also fire on nearby enemies. Metal Marines are largely autonomous but can be manually controlled to a minor degree (directional) by the player.","tags":[18,39,268435467,268435471,536870979,536871079,536871487,536871882,536871905,536872360,536872383,536874451,536888422,536896279,536897818]},{"id":26635,"cover":{"id":90763,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co1y17.jpg"},"name":"Mortal Kombat: Tournament Edition","platforms":[{"id":24,"name":"Game Boy Advance"}],"screenshots":[{"id":35254,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/wibqcp9fypruzyd4npzs.jpg"},{"id":35255,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/kjapsa85hrvmnxbecfgb.jpg"}],"summary":"This semi-sequel to Mortal Kombat: Deadly Alliance brings together a handful of the previous characters with a host of new and well-known faces making their debut on the GBA, including Bo Rai Cho, Johnny Cage, Raiden, Sareena, Nitara, Cyrax, Mavado, Reptile, Hsu Hao and Drahmin.\n\nIn addition to more fighters, this installment in the Mortal Kombat series provides multiplayer support for up to four players (via Game Boy Advance link cable), a variety of gameplay modes, and new battlegrounds.","tags":[1,268435460,536870973,536871019,536871041,536875091,536875215,536875478,536875854,536876732,536876828,536879583,536880365,536880794,536880801,536881112,536884027],"videos":[{"id":34319,"video_id":"IJ755_NU1Gc"}]},{"id":43847,"cover":{"id":50726,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/bnoma2tg2on5jceib4ws.jpg"},"name":"Patriotic Pinball","platforms":[{"id":7,"name":"PlayStation"}],"screenshots":[{"id":108546,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/jp0ebmco52wfpqqmy6lg.jpg"}],"summary":"It's time to explore and discover all the possibilities that can unfold in our proud nation.

Modes include Championship, Single Race, and Time Attack. The main mode is the Championship mode which lets the player compete in an underground ATV championship circuit which is being held amongst the French Alps. The player's goal is to win the races by any means necessary. The player gets to choose to play as one of six different racers, with each racer having their own ATV to race with. Each vehicle has its own unique ratings in speed, grip, and armor. The player then races against 5 of the other racers on 6 different tracks. The higher the position the player gets in a race, the more points and cash they earn. The player with the most points after all 6 races are done wins the championship. Also, after each race, the racer is asked questions by another character, where they get to choose their answer from a list of responses. For example, an investigative news reporter trying to get a scoop on the illegal races, gives the player an interview, which can earn the player some extra cash depending on how cooperative they are. Any cash earned can then be spent on more weapon ammo for the player's vehicle. Examples of weapons included in the game are grenades, land mines and homing missiles.","tags":[268435466,536875069]},{"id":153143,"cover":{"id":161456,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co3gkw.jpg"},"name":"AMG","platforms":[{"id":6,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}],"screenshots":[{"id":495492,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scambo.jpg"},{"id":495493,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scambp.jpg"},{"id":495494,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scambq.jpg"},{"id":495495,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scambr.jpg"},{"id":495496,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scambs.jpg"}],"summary":"Doomsday is a sci-fi interstellar war strategy online game.","tags":[18,33,39,268435471,268435487,536870984,536871458,536871475,536896654]},{"id":76036,"cover":{"id":106271,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co29zz.jpg"},"name":"Box Looter 2018","platforms":[{"id":6,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}],"screenshots":[{"id":135685,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/jsmwsyobgsyeus6jolct.jpg"},{"id":135686,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/fs6imgxzuevug3vkahyy.jpg"},{"id":135687,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/ekla1ihdoh4ofhclm7bg.jpg"},{"id":135688,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/rdxd7i5qjykgzc1zpt6c.jpg"},{"id":135689,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/dpcfrjchenbeiqrawzyt.jpg"}],"summary":"A dumb joke game in which loot boxes are the loot.

Procedural generation keeps the action fresh each time so you can get blown up and try again!\n\nMORE THAN RUN AND SHOOT\nYou improvise and create! Think on your feet to outsmart complex systems of traps. Will you disable the security camera or avoid it by melting through the floor with acid? Will you dodge the hulking robot or throw a chair to lure it into a pit? Stab the humans, hide from them, or carry them around as your special pets.

Items can be collected for extra lives or to add to the total cash score. The plane can be rotated upside to traverse back through the level, but only on horizontally scrolling areas. At the end of each level, the player is required to fight a boss enemy by repeatedly shooting its weak points. After beating a level, the player has the option to buy upgrades for Baloo's plane with the money collected, before proceeding to the next level. In bonus levels the player controls Kit on an airfoil to pop balloons for bonus points.","tags":[1,35,268435461,536871037,536871078,536871129,536871200,536871208,536871557,536871855,536875292,536888463,536896895,536898764,536898765],"videos":[{"id":3261,"video_id":"OAwpIFrZckU"},{"id":47197,"video_id":"VZwo_2GAtfk"}]},{"id":15738,"cover":{"id":156942,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co3d3i.jpg"},"name":"Bionicle: Maze of Shadows","platforms":[{"id":24,"name":"Game Boy Advance"}],"screenshots":[{"id":356696,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc7n88.jpg"},{"id":356697,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc7n89.jpg"},{"id":356698,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc7n8a.jpg"},{"id":356699,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc7n8b.jpg"},{"id":356700,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc7n8c.jpg"},{"id":356702,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc7n8e.jpg"},{"id":510839,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scay5z.jpg"},{"id":510840,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scay60.jpg"},{"id":510841,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scay61.jpg"},{"id":510842,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scay62.jpg"},{"id":510843,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scay63.jpg"},{"id":510844,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scay64.jpg"}],"summary":"A top down action-adventure, set in the LEGO Bionicle universe and based on the book of the same name.

The player controls a ninja whose mission to defeat an evil cult led by Bladedamus, a descendant of Nostradamus who seeks to fulfill his end of the world prophecies. Upon starting the game, the player is greeted by the phrase \"NINJA IN USA\". Up to two players can play simultaneously (Player 1 controls the blue-suited ninja, while Player 2 controls an orange-suited ninja).\n\nThe controls of the game consists of an eight-way joystick and three action buttons: Grab, Attack, and Jump. The Grab button is located on top of the joystick itself. The player character has five main techniques: The \"Triple Blow Combination\" is the player's primary attack, performed by pressing the attack button repeatedly while the player is standing on the ground. While jumping towards an adversary, the player can do a \"Flying Neck Throw\"; throwing an enemy into a background object (such as trash cans, phone booths, or signs) will cause different power-ups to appear, such as health restoring pills or a sword that can be wielded for a limited time. While standing near overhead signs or bars, the player can hang unto them by pressing the Grab button and perform a \"Hang Kick\". While overhanging on a bar, the player can also move by performing a \"Tightrope Walk\". The last of the five techniques is the \"Phoenix Backflip\", in which the player runs towards the wall and performs a backflip.\n\nThe game features a morbid continue screen, where the player character is tied to a table thrashing his head violently while a giant circular saw is being lowered towards him and what appears to be a crowd of enemies is watching in excitement in the background. If the player does not continue within the 10 second countdown, the screen fades to red, the ninja cries out in agony, and the words \"GAME OVER\" appears followed by dramatic music.\n\nThe first five rounds (stages) are based on actual American cities such as Los Angeles, New York City, Las Vegas, the Grand Canyon, and a Transcontinental Railroad. The sixth and final stage set inside the main villain's hideout. The recurring bosses includes a sumo wrestler; a pair of wrestlers resembling the Road Warriors tag team; and a trio of claw-wielding acrobats. The final boss is Bladedamus, who wields two swords.","tags":[1,268435481,268435489,536871076],"videos":[{"id":2480,"video_id":"3zgmz8NGe0Q"}]},{"id":33088,"cover":{"id":36319,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/zqkq8bhzpnpy8enoxg6l.jpg"},"name":"Bowslinger","platforms":[{"id":6,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}],"screenshots":[{"id":57306,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/q65cypvwssgfxvnily2w.jpg"},{"id":57307,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/bgjrlfye3gv5nh8r1ime.jpg"},{"id":57308,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/we1peyrb98fhfgek1sx7.jpg"},{"id":57309,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/cfgoyfurhk1k6wqbgqgh.jpg"},{"id":57310,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/ogbd0ga17snqoh3dinjk.jpg"}],"summary":"Ever wanted to shoot an apple off someone’s head?

Set between the second and third Saw films, Flesh & Blood puts players in the shoes of Michael, son of the first game's protagonist Detective David Tapp, as he looks for clues as to his father's death and becomes the latest target of Jigsaw and his strange apprentice Pighead II. The gameplay once again mixes heavy doses of survival horror and puzzle-solving with mild combat elements, as players attempt to help themselves, and others, out of life-and-death situations by successfully completing mini-games and quick-time events. The combat comes in two forms, with gamers using melee attacks and a variety of weapons in physical battles against Jigsaw's thugs, or executing puzzle-based attacks that make use of traps and environmental hazards. Various case files are strewn about the hotels, factories, and sewers in which the game is set, and players can also collect a number of Billy the Puppet dolls hidden throughout each level. As was the case with its predecessor, Saw II: Flesh & Blood includes multiple endings based on choices gamers make throughout the story.","tags":[19,21,268435465,268435487,536871041,536871052,536871878,536871945,536872032,536872098,536872205,536872225,536872257,536872691,536873787,536873890,536875046,536875054,536875157,536875271,536875294,536875324,536875354,536875483,536875527,536875534,536875551,536875553,536875570,536875639,536875682,536875731,536875885,536876062,536876090,536876302,536876349,536876358,536876359,536876694,536876695,536876838,536876901,536876957,536877288,536877319,536877587,536877604,536877652,536877657,536877893,536877974,536878200,536881625,536883374]},{"id":1780,"aggregated_rating":75.0,"cover":{"id":93463,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co2047.jpg"},"name":"Mega Man ZX Advent","platforms":[{"id":20,"name":"Nintendo DS"}],"screenshots":[{"id":26958,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/mpkrnwatrjjehncf7vgj.jpg"},{"id":396090,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc8hmi.jpg"},{"id":396091,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc8hmj.jpg"},{"id":396092,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc8hmk.jpg"}],"summary":"In Mega Man ZX Advent, the main characters discover the power of the mysterious \"Biometal model A,\" which on its own has several attacks, but also has a special Megamerge ability which allows the character to transform into one of eight \"Pseudoroid\" bosses that each have a unique set of abilities.

The 100 puzzles provided are divided into two groups of 50: Begin Mode and Main Mode. The first 50 puzzles must be solved in order to open up the remaining 50, but the puzzles are numbered in five rows of ten each -- solving seven rounds in a row will open up the next row of ten, thus the puzzles needn't be solved sequentially.\n\nPuzzle pieces in Turnabout come in three types: colored balls, colored blocks, and sliding blocks. By rotating the puzzle board, balls and sliding blocks adhere to the forces of gravity and fall down into open slots. Manipulating the puzzle correctly takes skill and usually no more than ten to fifteen \"steps,\" even at advanced levels. Learning to solve puzzles backward by picturing the flow of the pieces mentally can be an essential tool to success and none of the 100 puzzle board configurations are the same shape. For players looking for even more challenges, up to 50 custom-made puzzles can be devised, using five different colored balls and blocks and nine movable sliders (blocks) in Edit Mode.","tags":[268435465,536872407,536872475,536873787]},{"id":1779,"aggregated_rating":63.3333333333333,"cover":{"id":93467,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co204b.jpg"},"name":"Mega Man ZX","platforms":[{"id":20,"name":"Nintendo DS"}],"screenshots":[{"id":27910,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/bjpmstpn1ajghhqf8rvz.jpg"},{"id":165287,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/egzastbgw1h1kyhrua2d.jpg"},{"id":165288,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/i4aeqs7rtjrjsgj5gvfc.jpg"},{"id":165289,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/w9js6sqtxlflz567knxq.jpg"},{"id":165290,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/e7choadacxmjnroynfal.jpg"},{"id":165291,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/dsqq2ovdvwmqfz04k0i9.jpg"},{"id":165292,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/mltbsh2ngmv7ndcotgft.jpg"},{"id":165293,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/n0e3n6mavigqetzzopa2.jpg"},{"id":165294,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/vbyu9q4qchs2luaspymn.jpg"},{"id":165295,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/ztblagfza5fhkf5zjpz2.jpg"},{"id":165296,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/rz9ir7e6ij4epjksqlcb.jpg"},{"id":165297,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/oouvxyesqfw6unaalmt7.jpg"}],"summary":"This game contains elements from the Mega Man X series and the Mega Man Zero series.

While the games feature several expansions in key areas, the overall plot follows the same direction as the original Gold and Silver. Some aspects exclusive to Crystal are also included. Like how FireRed and LeafGreen could link up with Ruby, Sapphire, and Emerald to complete the Pokédex by trading regionally exclusive Pokémon, HeartGold and SoulSilver can link up with Diamond, Pearl, and Platinum to obtain Pokémon unavailable in Johto and Kanto (such as the Sinnoh starters) and vice versa.\nKris, despite being the female counterpart of Crystal's player character, is not included as the female player character, with a new character instead taking her place. Whether she is chosen to be the player character or not, this new character will still appear in the game. The unselected protagonist will take a pseudo-rival role similar to the unselected characters of Ruby, Sapphire, Emerald, Diamond, Pearl, and Platinum.\nThe games were released on September 12, 2009

Join forces with your former foe Rimat and battle against scores of angry denizens, preventing their dastardly machinations from being realized.\n\nZeno Clash 2 welcomes new players to the Zeno Clash universe with a new game that will bring them into the universe and fill them in on the backstory. Returning players will delight in the connections between the new settings and the first adventure. All players will thoroughly enjoy playing a first-person brawler that provides a rarity in modern gaming: a truly unique experience.\n\nZeno Clash 2 has beefed up its combat engine with precision punch targeting, blocking, and high-impact hits that only make the bone-crunching, face-rattling fistcuffs more satisfying. The new \"Lock-on\" function gives players a wider range of control for dishing out the damage. New RPG mechanics will allow Ghat and Rimat to punch harder, defend better, and recruit more powerful allies to aid in their quest.

Lomax recruits the former World War I fighter pilot Jake \"Lucky\" Masters for a dangerous mission: travel to Hong-Kong, locate a mysterious ninja, and find a way to infiltrate Li Deng's fortress and rescue Kate.\n\nHeart of China is an adventure game with a romantic theme somewhat reminiscent of films such as Raiders of the Lost Ark. The game is set during the 1930's in China as well as a few other locations. It uses a simple point-and-click system for interaction and object manipulation, and is very similar visually and gameplay-wise to Rise of the Dragon.\n\nSome of the tasks in the game have multiple solutions, allowing the player to pursue different methods and choose different responses in branching dialogues.

Final Fight can be played by up to two players simultaneously. Before the game begins, the player chooses between the three main characters: Haggar, Cody, and Guy. Each has his own fighting style and attributes. Health gauges are displayed for both player and enemy characters.\n\nThe controls for Final Fight consist of an eight-way joystick and two buttons for attacking and jumping respectively. Pressing the attack button repeatedly when attacking an enemy or multiple enemies will cause the player character to perform a combo. The final blow of the combo can be changed to a throw if the player moves the joystick in the opposite direction just before landing it. The player can also perform a jump attack. Pressing the attack and jump buttons simultaneously allows the player to perform a special attack that strikes all surrounding enemies, but will drain a small portion of the player's health.\n\nEnemies can be grabbed simply by walking into one of them. When an enemy is grabbed, the player can perform a grab attack by pressing the attack button or perform a throw by tilting the joystick left or right. A thrown enemy can be tossed at another for additional damage. Items such as weapons, health recovery items, and items awarding extra points can be picked up by standing over one and pressing the attack button. Weapons have limited uses and will disappear if the player is disarmed by an enemy too much or when the player moves to a new area.\n\nFinal Fight consists of six stages or \"rounds\", as well as two bonus rounds. Each round takes place in a different section of Metro City such as the Slums and the Subway, with most rounds featuring more than one level. At the end of each round the player will face a boss character unique to that round.","tags":[1,268435460,268435481,268435487,268435489,536870973,536871139,536871213,536871470,536871645,536871784,536871889,536871894,536871971,536872098,536872100,536872225,536872581,536873064,536874398,536874947,536875042,536875073,536875076,536875081,536875094,536875095,536875098,536875181,536875183,536875198,536875200,536875265,536875281,536875286,536875308,536875343,536875358,536875361,536875420,536875434,536875436,536875570,536875590,536875610,536875647,536875655,536875731,536875767,536875792,536875831,536875870,536875908,536875942,536875953,536876083,536876084,536876120,536876251,536876490,536876606,536876706,536876823,536876832,536876879,536876883,536876989,536877058,536877064,536877169,536877175,536877180,536877220,536877278,536877293,536877295,536877369,536877398,536877623,536877996,536878009,536878192,536878199,536878265,536878278,536878331,536878351,536878505,536879023,536879757,536880135,536880797,536880848,536880882,536881580,536883411,536883459,536883670,536884030,536897818],"videos":[{"id":2430,"video_id":"bOeh7E_YNr4"}]},{"id":119763,"cover":{"id":88910,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co1wlq.jpg"},"name":"Mortal Glory","platforms":[{"id":6,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}],"screenshots":[{"id":316767,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc6sf3.jpg"},{"id":316768,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc6sf4.jpg"},{"id":316769,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc6sf5.jpg"},{"id":316770,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc6sf6.jpg"},{"id":316771,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc6sf7.jpg"}],"summary":"Mortal Glory is a fantasy-themed tactical roguelike game about recruiting a team of gladiators and pitting them against brutal competition in a blood-soaked tournament.

After a short moment of confusion, Nick spots that his belt is missing. Then he sees the belt being carried away by bunny-like creatures who have obtained it. Since this special item is essential for him, Nick starts exploring the island. It doesn't take much time to get the belt back. On Mimin Island, Nick meets various Nintendo characters who also came there because of their own dreams and wishes. During their conversations, he learns that no one's wish has actually been granted so far. Only with the help of a chosen hero, Nick, or rather Captain Rainbow in this case, the wishes can be granted. Nick decides to help the islanders. The hero gets support from bunny-like beings called Mimin, the dominant species of Mimin Island.\n\nThis game was only released in Japan","tags":[1,268435487,536871249,536871308,536871958,536872977,536873299,536873929,536882843,536885272,536895164,536895518,536896177,536896548,536900546,536900657,536901486,536901660,536901692,536901693,536901694,536901695,536901696,536901697,536901698,536901699,536901700,536901701,536902076],"videos":[{"id":36569,"video_id":"z_MzlCtKyYg"},{"id":36570,"video_id":"CkIO3eOMGo4"}]},{"id":35221,"name":"Downpour","platforms":[{"id":6,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}],"screenshots":[{"id":84355,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/ktxzld5dvvjrkzw0nd85.jpg"},{"id":84356,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/w05fbwfqhgqhziedchm3.jpg"},{"id":84357,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/yibwzsex9wymjt2lwzbz.jpg"},{"id":84358,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/uiqbhzstuo7lwce15kfr.jpg"},{"id":84359,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/yntnmqt0n09lx4qkqled.jpg"}],"summary":"Downpour is a hardcore 2D Base survival game.

Players can select from among different styles like hip hop, pop, trance, garage indy, and metal, then add, mix, and modify clips from the thousands available to create their own unique songs. HITZ FACTORY also supports USB microphones, so players can even record their own music or vocals to include. Vocals will be analyzed and a new musical riff will be created based off of player's pitch and range. Players can then hear what they just sang as if it was played on a guitar, the drums, or other instruments. HITZ FACTORY also lets players create music videos to go with the music by blending several of the more than 500 clips available into their own video. Up to four different clips can be layered together then mixed with different effects like color, kaleidoscopes, and more. Finally, the DJ Supermixer mode lets players be the DJ with a set of virtual decks to spin.
