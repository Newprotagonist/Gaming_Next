To do that, he has to venture into his heavily protected headquarters, dealing with security guards and robots on his way.","tags":[1,18,268435461,536870979,536871015,536871213,536871487,536871947,536872220,536873999,536874828,536874848,536874947,536875097,536875358,536875483,536875484,536875523,536875538,536875830,536875907,536876235,536877264,536877309,536877799,536877961,536878002,536878317,536879042,536879869,536879932,536880582,536880639,536886010,536886301,536898549]},{"id":36621,"cover":{"id":115491,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co2h43.jpg"},"name":"Puzzle Showdown 4K","platforms":[{"id":6,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"},{"id":48,"name":"PlayStation 4"}],"screenshots":[{"id":47098,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/nxxr3kpzyp3fvvbxffgd.jpg"},{"id":47099,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/mdiwhesg9jhdeyj83bg7.jpg"},{"id":47100,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/qoowwo7lgfv6l675pof5.jpg"},{"id":47101,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/pjqsipuxpp5ytyyrwrdo.jpg"},{"id":47102,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/szd1qx7ozr6dyn1o0h0d.jpg"}],"summary":"Puzzle Showdown 4K is a fun new way to build jigsaw puzzles.

Only the Quarp Jet is capable of a rescue operation because it has the power to teleport. Unfortunately the mission is further complicated by the invasion of a neighboring race. Moreover the ships can only be rescued after disabling their shields. The shields can only be disabled through circuit breakers. The circuit breakers are scattered, and must be deactivated in the correct order. In Velocity the player takes on the role of the Quarp Jet. They must find the station, disable their shields, and rescue the stranded ships. Concurrently they must also battle with the invading race, the Zetachron.\n\nVelocity is a shoot 'em up video game developed by FuturLab for the PlayStation 3, PlayStation Portable, and PlayStation Vita as a PlayStation mini.\n\nVelocity '​s gameplay involves navigating the Quarp Jet – a teleporting spacecraft – through space, whilst avoiding and defeating enemies using bombs that can be flung in cardinal directions. The main goal of the game is to rescue stranded ships. The game adds depth by introducing new abilities and obstacles. The stranded ships are protected by shields that must be disabled by switches in a specific order. The player's ship has the ability to fire bombs. The game allows the player to teleport their ship anywhere. It also allows the player create telepods which they can return to anytime. The telepods add a puzzle element to the game because the player has to return to activate the switches in the right order.\n\nThe following review was found at: http://www.deltaattack.com/2012/05/23/review-velocity-psp/\n\nVelocity is hands-down the best PlayStation mini I’ve experienced. Any fan of space-shooters or even of action games in general should strongly consider it.\n\nVelocity took a genre that I had thought done-to-death and revitalized it with highly innovative mechanics. You unlock them as you play through the first half of the game’s 50 levels, and they are:\n\n- Hold R to scroll the screen more quickly. All levels scroll vertically upward, but this lets you increase the scroll speed. Some levels have a short time-limit, requiring you to boost most of the way through.\n\n- Hold Square to move a reticle for teleporting. Used to bypass obstacles, jump over a swarm of enemies, etc.\n\n- Press Circle to launch a bomb in the direction you last moved. Used for destructible obstacles and to decimate static enemies or tight groups of moving enemies.\n\n- Press Triangle to drop a telepod. At any point, you can press L to bring up a map of the level, then move the cursor between telepods, letting you jump back to an earlier part of the level. Necessary when splits occur in a level. Telepods are limited to a certain number per level.\n\nFurther complicating matters are color-coded security systems. Each one generates an instant-death laser field, and can only be disabled by attacking numbered switches in order. Telepods often come in to play with these, requiring you to backtrack in a level in order to trigger switches that you passed up earlier.\n\nThe point of all this is that a star has gone black-hole and is eating up your employer’s mining operations. You must navigate the Quarp Jet through collapsed levels, rescuing miners and scientists stranded in escape capsules. You need to grab a minimum number of capsules in each level.\n\nOne nice feature Velocity has that most space-shooters don’t is that you can run into walls without taking damage. That was an excellent design choice, because with all the speed-scrolling, teleporting, and narrow corridors, the game would be nearly impossible otherwise. Also, your ship has a life meter, so you can take several hits before dying, and you can even refill your health via in-level items.\n\nThe game also has a bumpin’ soundtrack. It’s impressive for a space-shooter in general, let alone a mini. Oddly, it will sometimes cut out between levels, but it’s always there when you’re actually playing.\n\nMy only real complaint about the game, and this is kind of a big one, is that difficulty is forced towards the end. You get experience (XP) based on how well you do in a level, and each level has a minimum XP requirement in order to play it, meaning you will eventually have to go back and play prior levels to get more XP before being able to beat the game. I was disheartened to see this, because otherwise you could make your own difficulty on the fly by being content with Bronze or Silver on a level, but as it is, you’ll have to revisit levels to get Gold and additional XP.\n\nEven with forced-difficulty, this is a stellar title. Between the 50 levels, unlockable missions, a Minesweeper-type game, and the cheat codes and numerous other extra goodies, you’ll get a lot of top-notch entertainment for your money.","tags":[18,268435461,268435465,536871078,536871186,536871882,536872898,536873787,536875046,536875057,536875347,536875638,536875879,536876026,536876192,536876240]},{"id":5813,"aggregated_rating":30.0,"cover":{"id":103921,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co286p.jpg"},"name":"Dino Crisis 3","platforms":[{"id":11,"name":"Xbox"}],"screenshots":[{"id":384337,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc88k1.jpg"},{"id":384338,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc88k2.jpg"},{"id":384339,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc88k3.jpg"},{"id":384340,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc88k4.jpg"}],"summary":"Dino Crisis 3 is a survival horror video game released exclusively for the Xbox.

Shortly after his arrival, a group of soldiers crash land on the island after their helicopter has engine troubles. They must all find ways to survive the island's \"monsters\", the shibito.\n\nThe game is played through several character perspectives, each with his or her own strengths and weaknesses, through an overlapping timeline of the fateful night that alternates between the present and the past.

It is a sequel and expansion on Resident Evil Outbreak, which was originally envisioned as a much larger game before being cut into multiple releases, containing levels which failed to be completed in time for the original game's release.\n\nThe same eight characters from the first title return with similar abilities, and the game takes place once again in a zombie-run Raccoon City. The new game has several new scenarios and boasts new gameplay developments for the Resident Evil series. Loading times have been reduced and while the previous Outbreak was on-line enabled in the US, this game is the first on-line Resident Evil game in Europe.\n\nThe locals featured in this game include both the familiar (The Raccoon Police Department) and the exotic (A mutated jungle at mid-day) ones. The game boasts a hefty amount of unlockable material such as artworks, notes, trivia, and character costumes. The game is backwards compatible with your save file from Resident Evil: Outbreak, meaning that you can take your unlocked content to this new setting.","tags":[19,21,268435461,268435465,268435487,536870917],"videos":[{"id":3892,"video_id":"P3N00760-cM"}]},{"id":159420,"cover":{"id":170999,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co3nxz.jpg"},"name":"CUBE-e","platforms":[{"id":6,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}],"screenshots":[{"id":552948,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scbuno.jpg"},{"id":552952,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scbuns.jpg"},{"id":552955,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scbunv.jpg"},{"id":552959,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scbunz.jpg"},{"id":552966,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scbuo6.jpg"},{"id":552969,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scbuo9.jpg"},{"id":552971,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scbuob.jpg"},{"id":552975,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scbuof.jpg"},{"id":552976,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scbuog.jpg"}],"summary":"CUBE-e - platformer on accuracy with a change in gravity, performed in 2D graphics.","tags":[1,268435471,268435487,268435488]},{"id":148017,"cover":{"id":155583,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co3c1r.jpg"},"name":"Observer: System Redux - Day One Edition","platforms":[{"id":6,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"},{"id":48,"name":"PlayStation 4"},{"id":49,"name":"Xbox One"},{"id":167,"name":"PlayStation 5"}],"screenshots":[{"id":502657,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scarup.jpg"},{"id":502658,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scaruq.jpg"},{"id":502659,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scarur.jpg"}],"summary":"Observer: System Redux is the definitive vision of the award-winning cyberpunk thriller, rebuilt and augmented for the next generation.

It is similar to the PC and console versions of the same name and by the same developer. Those versions are not identical and described as an \"upmake\" of the NES version. The game borrows elements from Windjammers, which served as an inspiration.\n\nPlayers select one of six characters from a cast with names such as Rad Carlton, Bruiser Bogardus, Hot Foot Francis, Sparerib Boneapart, Mayo Monsoon or Ollie Oilsack. There are also multiple environments and different game modes. The characters are described as lumberjacks. Matches take place on a fixed screen view shown from an elevated position. Characters are standing on rolling logs and throw an axe that acts like a ball.\n\nIn a typical tournament different opponents need to be defeated one after the other. Points are scored by throwing the axe into the goal area behind the opponent. This zone is different for each environment. Sometimes there is only a single, large goal area, while another environment has three zones for five, two and five points respectively. In some levels like North Pool the middle part is entirely open, while in others like Mount Olympus the axe can only be thrown through a few open passages.\n\nThe opponent guards these areas and attempts to catch or bounce back the axe to try the same on the other side. A set is won when someone reaches twelve points. The best of three sets wins a match. Special items appear during matches such as stars (use a signature throw different for each character), magnets (increase catching range for five seconds), ice cubes (decrease the opponent's movement speed for a short amount of time) and oil (the axe cannot be caught for five seconds and will bounce back instead, and at a reduced speed). There are counters for some power-ups. For instance, when the signature throw is caught by the opponent, their signature throw becomes active right away.\n\nThe game supports competitive multiplayer against another opponent on the same screen. The game comes in a box with a green cartridge and a full colour manual.","tags":[1,27,268435470,268435489,536872078,536872529,536875319,536875384,536876643,536888699,536896320],"videos":[{"id":53250,"video_id":"q-1jNUI1_0I"}]},{"id":142883,"aggregated_rating":70.0,"cover":{"id":125985,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co2p7l.jpg"},"name":"Expedition Zero","platforms":[{"id":6,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}],"screenshots":[{"id":759407,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scg9yn.jpg"},{"id":759408,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scg9yo.jpg"},{"id":759409,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scg9yp.jpg"},{"id":759410,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scg9yq.jpg"},{"id":759411,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scg9yr.jpg"},{"id":759412,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scg9ys.jpg"},{"id":759413,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scg9yt.jpg"},{"id":759414,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scg9yu.jpg"},{"id":759415,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scg9yv.jpg"},{"id":759416,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scg9yw.jpg"}],"summary":"Expedition Zero is a survival horror game set in the heart of rural Siberia.
