It is the direct sequel to the 1987 Darius. It was later released as Sagaia in Japan in 1991 for the Game Boy as well as non-Japanese ports. A remake was released for the PC Engine Super CD-ROM as Super Darius II in 1993.\n\nA Mega Drive conversion was released in Japan in 1990; it was later released for the Genesis in the United States and Brazil in 1991, where it was renamed Sagaia. Changes include a boss rush mode (via a code) and various modifications to levels and mechanics, such as the boss Steel Spine being moved to another level and the boss Killer Higia being replaced with a similar creation called Nehonojia. This conversion does not support two players, so the ability to choose between Proco Jr. and Tiat Young was added; Proco plays like normal, while Tiat starts every life off with one power level to every weapon.\n\nA Master System conversion, developed by Natsume, was released in Europe and Brazil in 1992, also titled Sagaia. It is somewhat based on the Mega Drive port, and while Tiat Young and her abilities are still present (though even more limited), many zones (and thus bosses) have been completely removed.\n\nThe Super CD-ROM version features an entirely new set of bosses, major changes to levels, and a fully arranged soundtrack including new songs.","tags":[18,268435461,268435489,536871078,536871756,536871882],"videos":[{"id":47873,"video_id":"L6yN6rRheJI"}]},{"id":121275,"cover":{"id":137895,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co2yef.jpg"},"name":"Boku to Nurse no Kenshuu Nisshi","platforms":[{"id":6,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"},{"id":46,"name":"PlayStation Vita"},{"id":48,"name":"PlayStation 4"},{"id":130,"name":"Nintendo Switch"}],"screenshots":[{"id":436964,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc9d5w.jpg"},{"id":436965,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc9d5x.jpg"},{"id":436966,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc9d5y.jpg"}],"tags":[42,44,268435469,268435490,536872208,536874498,536875703,536876646,536894270,536895628,536895675,536897218],"videos":[{"id":48324,"video_id":"heKr5oFIHWI"}]},{"id":132639,"cover":{"id":157448,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co3dhk.jpg"},"name":"Rance 4.2 ~ Angel Army ~","platforms":[{"id":6,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"},{"id":118,"name":"FM Towns"},{"id":149,"name":"PC-98"}],"screenshots":[{"id":379760,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc850w.jpg"},{"id":379761,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc850x.jpg"},{"id":379762,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc850y.jpg"}],"summary":"Rance 4.1 and Rance 4.2 are two parts of the same storyline, and use the same mechanics and artstyle.

The rooms are connected to each other by thin routes, where the only available actions are \"Advance\" and \"Retreat\", to take a step forwards or backward. (Most routes are about 3-5 steps long). These paths are the spots where random encounters can occur. When the game starts, the base is unmapped, and paths are marked on menus as \"???\". Each time the player crosses a path and enters a new room, Athena 2.0 will draw the room on the map (with a short dialogue among the party Rance about how to name and illustrate it; sometimes giving comical or non-indicative names).

Each comes with three varying abilities; the driving skill affects a character's handling ability and top speed, tactical affects weapon lock-on times and aggression is that character's strength. Among the characters is the dangerous Motormouth that thrives on death and annihilation; Thula Crimstone, a future leader of the Starian Empire; Jackal, a war-torn being that wishes to destroy all those that bring war against his people; and the spiritual Hiroki. Throughout the game, they'll earn experience points that increase ability points.","tags":[268435466]},{"id":44251,"name":"Symbiotic Overload","platforms":[{"id":6,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}],"screenshots":[{"id":109655,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/xcaw45oiakju9zwq8xau.jpg"},{"id":109656,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/okb1pg1jxiaycrx66ciw.jpg"},{"id":109657,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/chbfqlnhjfjeyukzb8dm.jpg"},{"id":109658,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/yfjhqpo65wkettefp7nr.jpg"},{"id":109659,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/djhmzyrk8pmsvzjdcg42.jpg"}],"summary":"The age of machines ruling the world happened long ago.

While magic energy existed in all living creatures beforehand, it suddenly became far more powerful thirty years before the beginning of the game. Because of this, it has affected society greatly, with devices called \"Magic Engines\" harnessing this power for lighting, automobiles, communication, and robots, among other uses. While previously only a select few could wield magic, many magicians gained the ability. However, such progress has also caused two nations to develop new and more powerful weapons of mass destruction. The kingdom of Gohtza and the Republic of Uhra (which recently converted from a monarchy). Uhra is building Grand Staff, a gigantic magic engine, while the heavily industrialized Gohtza actively pursues magic research of their own. A third nation, the Free Ocean State of Numara, remains isolated and neutral, though it is falling into disarray due to a general attempting to stage a coup d'etat. Uhra, at war with Khent, a nation of beastmen, sends its forces to the Highlands of Wohl for a decisive battle at the start of the game.","tags":[268435468,268435472,536871208,536871327,536871938,536872371,536875695,536876545,536877383,536880240,536881267,536883158],"videos":[{"id":27109,"video_id":"nmZpAdxdBJI"}]},{"id":176019,"cover":{"id":216918,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co4ndi.jpg"},"name":"Soft Underbelly","platforms":[{"id":6,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"},{"id":82,"name":"Web browser"}],"screenshots":[{"id":668645,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scebxh.jpg"}],"summary":"Soft Underbelly is a short narrative game about taking a break and having a stream-of-consciousness conversation with your cat about friendship, trust, and care.","tags":[268435490,536872227,536875241,536894843]},{"id":109580,"aggregated_rating":64.5,"cover":{"id":68716,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/jkyxmchptaftd9kfctp1.jpg"},"name":"Resonance of Fate 4k/HD Edition","platforms":[{"id":6,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"},{"id":48,"name":"PlayStation 4"}],"screenshots":[{"id":256293,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scfcnyigjhvodsgqacps.jpg"},{"id":256294,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/ggopy2cal3dtif95gr7c.jpg"},{"id":256295,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/mo5czsjsmmfbvpf0kdad.jpg"},{"id":256296,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/qm5sw1129naqpfiiptcw.jpg"},{"id":256297,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/dygkvrdttgnomhlhegoi.jpg"},{"id":256298,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/rh2gpjvu4nv5m02jlacz.jpg"},{"id":256299,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/xbx897ndeszi3nnfpe5t.jpg"},{"id":256300,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/zcnzbbwq4cuqcybmv2lz.jpg"},{"id":256301,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/ewsw77c1b5tmpfgr3qh6.jpg"},{"id":256302,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/o4uivpofvtj5nx0psqkm.jpg"}],"summary":"This symphonic gunplay RPG, where you can change the fate of the world, has been remastered in a 4K/HD EDITION.

The nephew of Agent 007 must foil the plans of malevolent S.C.U.M. agents, who are hunting for rare artifacts that would allow them to dominate the world. Unlike the NES game, this version is a more action-oriented side-scrolling game without detailed mission objectives or puzzle-solving.\n\nThe game consists of three levels, each beginning with a section in which Bond pilots a helicopter, a boat, and a jet, respectively. These are controlled in arcade-like fashion, similarly to side-scrolling shooters. Enemies must be dealt with using weapons mounted on the craft. Various hazards are scattered through the stages, requiring the player to react quickly in order to stay alive.","tags":[1,268435461,268435464,268435487,536870933,536871037,536871213,536871859,536871939,536872131,536872651,536872668,536874209,536874398,536874706,536874745,536875053,536875054,536875073,536875082,536875229,536875262,536875292,536875358,536875606,536875934,536876120,536876274,536876348,536876546,536876687,536876694,536877807]},{"id":8974,"aggregated_rating":89.5,"cover":{"id":119492,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co2k78.jpg"},"name":"Football Manager 2013","platforms":[{"id":6,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"},{"id":14,"name":"Mac"}],"screenshots":[{"id":29718,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/h1yhewh6flmo0jra7lwi.jpg"},{"id":635521,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scdmdd.jpg"},{"id":635522,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scdmde.jpg"}],"summary":"Football Manager 2013 (often abbreviated to Football Manager 13, or more commonly FM13) is a 2012 football management simulation video game developed by Sports Interactive and published by Sega.

While the village leader was a powerful warrior, trained in both hand-to-hand combat and magic, he could not overpower them.  \n \nUltimately, he had no choice but to sacrifice his own life by casting a powerful sealing spell on the beasts.

As student after student goes missing, it's up to you and three friends to abandon your training and set out into the unknown world.

The game is split into 10 levels - the first 9 are groups of 3 territories which can be completed in any order, while the final 'Mother of All Battles' has its own surprises.\n\nLand is mostly of sand, grass or ice. You start with 100 men and you can use whatever quantity you find necessary on each island. The rest men left will go to another level with another new 100. In the second half of the game you can freeze men to save them for the Mother of All Battles. Once you select your island and place for your HQ, you must do some research for better weapons and defences. On the roof of your buildings you can put protectors like archers, gunmen, boiling oil men, and later on even laser turrets. If you send a team of unarmed men into an unoccupied square, they will build an additional base there, with larger armies completing this more quickly.\n\nLater on higher levels, you'll also build mines and factories, as you'll need to dig a certain material for higher level weapons, depending on whether the area you're on is rich with a certain material or not.

It is Infocom's third game.\n\nThe player's character in Deadline is an unnamed police detective, summoned to a sprawling Connecticut estate to investigate the apparent suicide of wealthy industrialist Marshall Robner. At first, it seems a very straightforward case: the body was discovered in the library, which had been locked from the inside, and the cause of death was an overdose of his prescribed antidepressants. But something just doesn't feel right. Could someone have killed Robner for his money? Did he make an enemy through his business dealings? Or was there some other motive? With the able assistance of level-headed Sgt.

Infocom was closed in 1989 by its then-parent company Activision. Still holding the copyright to nearly all the past Infocom titles, Activision bundled 20 of the most popular into this package. The games included are:\n\nZork I\nZork II\nZork III\nBeyond Zork\nZork Zero\nEnchanter\nSorcerer\nSpellbreaker\nDeadline\nThe Witness\nSuspect\nThe Lurking Horror\nBallyhoo\nInfidel\nMoonmist\nStarcross\nSuspended\nPlanetfall\nStationfall\nThe Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy\n\nThe package contains all the instructions (bound in one volume) and maps for each game as well as all the InvisiClues, printed normally instead of using \"invisible\" ink. The package also features a launch menu which lets the user select which one of the 20 games they wish to play.\n\nAn additional bonus was the updated version of Hitchhiker's Guide. The game was repackaged using a later version of the Z-machine than the original, and now featured a built-in hint system.\n\nSome significant omissions from the package were the \"feelies\" for which Infocom had become known.

When you start on your journey you should first catch this elusive platform. You can continue without it, but only the foolish would dare to do so. Once on the Flying Platform you can go anywhere on the screen to avoid or destroy the enemy.

In 2007, the game received a sequel, Sonic Rush Adventure.","tags":[1,35,268435464,536871075,536871208,536871306,536871487,536871501,536871506,536871645,536871971,536872010,536872098,536872211,536872961,536873064,536874398,536874743,536874745,536874824,536875073,536875074,536875076,536875088,536875101,536875128,536875199,536875201,536875209,536875213,536875228,536875241,536875367,536875369,536875370,536875371,536875396,536875413,536875435,536875437,536875441,536875453,536875489,536875523,536875658,536875689,536875740,536875816,536875819,536875855,536875870,536875883,536875902,536875934,536875941,536875954,536876120,536876214,536876318,536876470,536876713,536876827,536876850,536876947,536876952,536877006,536877029,536877099,536877399,536877406,536877723,536877839,536878033,536878132,536878149,536878192,536878256,536878566,536883921,536884021],"videos":[{"id":39493,"video_id":"03_E3hP8uso"},{"id":39494,"video_id":"E61iUraFV8k"}]},{"id":195491,"cover":{"id":221189,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co4qo5.jpg"},"name":"Flappy Bird","platforms":[{"id":24,"name":"Game Boy Advance"}],"screenshots":[{"id":763122,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scgctu.jpg"},{"id":763123,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scgctv.jpg"}],"summary":"A homebrew unofficial port Flappy Bird for the Game Boy Advance.","tags":[268435464,536872529,536872916,536898029,536903616]},{"id":195495,"cover":{"id":214861,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co4lsd.jpg"},"name":"Snake","platforms":[{"id":33,"name":"Game Boy"}],"screenshots":[{"id":763127,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scgctz.jpg"},{"id":763128,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scgcu0.jpg"}],"summary":"Snake is a Snake (Mobile) unofficial port for the Game Boy.","tags":[268435465,268435489,536872529,536872667,536903610,536903633]},{"id":5394,"cover":{"id":186626,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co4002.jpg"},"name":"Iron Helix","platforms":[{"id":6,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"},{"id":14,"name":"Mac"},{"id":78,"name":"Sega CD"}],"summary":"Set far in the future, the human race is in the middle of a cold war with an alien race called the Thanatosians. During a target practice by an Earth fleet that will destroy an uninhabited planet, the heavy destroyer Jeremiah O'Brien is infected with an unknown virus that mutates the crew. No longer recognized due to the changes in their DNA, the O'Brien's security robot, simply known as \"the Ship's Defender\", assumes they are invaders and kills them. An apparent technical malfunction has caused the O'Brien's computer to believe that it was in a real life war situation, and select the planet Calliope as a target for destruction. Like all of the human fleet's Cerberus-class destroyers, the O'Brien carries a weapon known as \"Iron Helix\", which is capable of destroying all life on a planet in a single act. An attack on Calliope, a peaceful Thanatosian planet, would cause the war to go \"hot\".\n\nThe player is on board the scientific exploration ship Indiana, and is contacted by the Earth's forces in an attempt to stop the O'Brien, as it was the only ship nearby. As the ship is infected with the unknown virus, the player instead remotely controls a zoological robot that is sent over to explore. As much of the ship's systems are locked out using DNA detectors, the robot must collect uncontaminated samples of the crew's DNA to access different secured areas on board. The robot can also interface with dataports on the O'Brien to operate its systems, from opening doors to issuing executive commands.","tags":[1,18,19,21,268435471,268435487,536871882,536874694,536875426,536880943]},{"id":17385,"cover":{"id":191523,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co43s3.jpg"},"name":"The Few","platforms":[{"id":6,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"},{"id":14,"name":"Mac"}],"screenshots":[{"id":95127,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/lk0elboabiwagd5b5csm.jpg"},{"id":95128,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/hxngdzookjtaww3ftiah.jpg"},{"id":95129,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/flqunr3v2x1b07yvrj98.jpg"},{"id":95130,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/n01ndowm0gfroxnkqm4j.jpg"},{"id":95131,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/ucwxw2np9r5quri1ospq.jpg"}],"summary":"Once combat is initiated the player can lead their squadrons to attack waves of German bombers utilizing simple touch or mouse commands.

A vast variety of music can be generated, from delicate beach chillout to country banjo techno.","tags":[27,268435467,268435471,268435488,268435489,536870989,536871013,536871262,536872383,536872406,536872840,536876759],"videos":[{"id":4021,"video_id":"DT2OlB-SyYo"}]},{"id":176014,"cover":{"id":185853,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co3zel.jpg"},"name":"Final Drive Fury","platforms":[{"id":6,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}],"screenshots":[{"id":661996,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sce6ss.jpg"},{"id":661997,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sce6st.jpg"}],"summary":"A 3D racing game by Wild Games featuring numerous tracks and cars (including Kia Spectra)"},{"id":176027,"cover":{"id":199656,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co4a20.jpg"},"name":"Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles X Justice League Turbo","platforms":[{"id":6,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}],"screenshots":[{"id":662034,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sce6tu.jpg"},{"id":662035,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sce6tv.jpg"}],"summary":"TMNTXJL is a fan made fighting game that runs on the I.K.E.M.E.N.
