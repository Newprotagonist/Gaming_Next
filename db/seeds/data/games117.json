Earthsiege 2 is set in the Earthsiege universe, which contains its predecessors Earthsiege (1994) and Battledrome (1995), as well as the action game Hunter Hunted (1996), strategy games MissionForce: CyberStorm (1997) and Cyberstorm 2: Corporate Wars (1998), simulation Starsiege (1999), and first-person shooters Starsiege: Tribes (1999), Tribes 2 (2001), Tribes Aerial Assault (2002), Tribes: Vengeance (2004) and Tribes: Ascend (2012).\n\nAs a simulation, Earthsiege 2 gives players the opportunity to pilot massive bipedal war machines known as HERCULANs (Humaniform-Emulation Roboticized Combat Unit with Leg-Articulated Navigation) (or 'HERCs' for short). Set in the 26th or 27th century, Earthsiege 2 features advanced weapons and technology for waging war. Earthsiege 2 takes place across North America, South America, Antarctica, Asia, Australia, Europe, and the moon.\n\nEarthsiege 2 features a more advanced engine than Earthsiege, increasing the game's maximum resolution to 640*480. Additionally, the game features much more detailed terrain than its predecessor. Earthsiege 2 has 3D rolling terrain rather than the flat landscape of Earthsiege. Furthermore, video briefings and debriefings, along with included squadmate voices, add to the atmosphere of the game.","tags":[1,18,268435469,536870915,536870937,536870981,536871079,536872009,536872060,536873874,536874451,536874539,536874947,536875265,536875309,536875426,536876028,536876990,536880210,536880222,536895717],"videos":[{"id":4497,"video_id":"ugQUwJyEHAE"},{"id":36364,"video_id":"BqILPYigsfk"}]},{"id":127192,"cover":{"id":106848,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co2ag0.jpg"},"name":"Colony Siege","platforms":[{"id":6,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}],"screenshots":[{"id":367326,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc7vfi.jpg"},{"id":367327,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc7vfj.jpg"},{"id":367328,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc7vfk.jpg"},{"id":367329,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc7vfl.jpg"},{"id":367330,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc7vfm.jpg"},{"id":367331,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc7vfn.jpg"},{"id":367332,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc7vfo.jpg"},{"id":367333,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc7vfp.jpg"},{"id":367334,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc7vfq.jpg"}],"summary":"Build your base.

The idea is to blend two genres, Beat’em all Action and RPG, combining character progression, immersion, equipment collection, additional quests and a solid storyline with rhythmic combat sequences, a sense of power from the beginning of the game and of course QTE and bosses with sequential behaviour.\nThis combination leads to a true innovative gameplay supported by many other key features : you can choose between two characters whose different stories intertwine and whose skills vary.\nThe game’s environment has been designed to be an asset in itself, or an important part of the gameplay, with lighting effects which create unprecedented combat situations.\nThe world created for Mars has been designed to offer a true voyage in the heart of a totally new universe mingling decadent futuristic technology and precarious survival on a planet with highly extreme conditions.\nThe storyline leads you to discover your own identity in a web of political intrigue and complex conflicts between forces, allowing you to better understand the world you are travelling. Many scripted sequences give rise to the action and storyline, creating unforgettable moments.\n\n- Combat\nThe combat phases are dynamic and spectacular no matter your level of implication during the quests.\nMost confrontations are brief : you move from one enemy to the other striking or throwing spells one after the\nother. Combat against the bosses or champions lasts longer though, as you must use different tactics to beat them.\nAs you can also modify your environment by breaking part of a roof or moving metal plates to use light as a weapon, the fights gain a more strategic dimension.\nPlaying the role of Pandora is as intense as playing Seth. To make her cast her most powerful spells a precise timing is required as well as constant movement to avoid being interrupted. Even though she is less powerful she is more agile, and just like the warrior needs his weapons, she is nothing without her gauntlets which allow her to canalize her fluid.\nAll enemies, if wounded enough, can be finished off in a spectacular way.\n\n- Two characters : two stories and two forms of gameplay\nMars allows you to choose between two characters with different skills and\nAbilities : Seth, is an elite soldier and highly skilled fighter who tends to act brutally even if athletically. As he progresses in the game he can learn many special attacks and how to master new weapons.\nPandora on the other hand is a technomancer who handles fluids with catalyst gauntlets to produce devastating magic. But more than just using different skills, playing each character results in a different control and gameplay. Their story varies a lot even though it follows a similar course, allowing you to discover two versions of Mars.\n\n- Light effects\nOn Mars sunlight is deadly, which means you can use it during combat to beat your enemies. Seth and Pandora can make gaps in rooftops of different buildings they are fighting on to expose their opponents to sunrays, use mirrors to reflect light on them or push them away from the protection of shady paths.\nYou can modify the architecture of the environment during combat while making sure your character is not exposed to sunrays and watch out for shadows moving position around the sun’s movement. The impact the sun has on the gameplay provides a new feature not only during combat but during the entire game itself.\n\n- A new world\nThe Mars universe is unprecedented, not at all like normal mythological or fantasy worlds, offering a journey in a credible futuristic world where survival and the ability to adapt are keys to be able to withstand a hostile, desperate and decadent environment. The game’s story, complex political system and religion, as well as its many creatures and different inhabitants lead you through an unforgettable journey in an \"extraterrestrial\" world.","tags":[536898646]},{"id":25623,"aggregated_rating":80.1666666666667,"cover":{"id":68007,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/m0l4ma2qdh7z2m5o6m5l.jpg"},"name":"Monster Hunter Generations Ultimate","platforms":[{"id":37,"name":"Nintendo 3DS"},{"id":130,"name":"Nintendo Switch"}],"screenshots":[{"id":212198,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/gzwj7vjsf6nm3wwguwni.jpg"},{"id":212199,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/fj9k5arjf5iewxosqo4v.jpg"},{"id":213052,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/jhzyq7pc6kfpgi7nrr0o.jpg"},{"id":213053,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/hpqfcwff4hkokqftewos.jpg"},{"id":213054,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/amgmfldyn0cwtebjtenj.jpg"},{"id":213055,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/n9jikwicn64quiltps6o.jpg"},{"id":213056,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/yclsidxspm59tfbqzdrb.jpg"},{"id":213057,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/heaq0emejcfii281djmw.jpg"},{"id":213058,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/ly4vwylafc8px6tit1qc.jpg"},{"id":213059,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/grsc1ibqorw2u6gezem2.jpg"},{"id":213060,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/uec3qqsodvgwdvrs2s4u.jpg"}],"summary":"An enhanced version of Monster Hunter Generations.

The mod was completed in August of 2005, with the main dev at that point (M_26_7 / SpikedHelmet) deciding it was time to move on. Not long after, an early version of the Spring engine was released — an engine designed to run content from Total Annihilation, and Axis & Allies TA was soon ported by a fan, and then by FLOZi in November of 2005. The port was then released in December 2006 with a few bits of new content (mostly infantry models) and updated game play elements. \n \nAfter that release, AATA was reborn as Spring: 1944 – a complete re-build from scratch, using all-new content and a new design philosophy. While our release schedule has been a tad on the erratic side, work has been progressing continuously ever since 2006, with published builds going out approximately once or twice a year. The game reached a nearly completed state between 2010-2011, and most of the work since that point has focused on balance, a handful of new gameplay mechanics, cleaning up the game’s internals and smoothing out the experience for new players."},{"id":178361,"cover":{"id":213974,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co4l3q.jpg"},"name":"The Dark Pictures Anthology: The Devil in Me","platforms":[{"id":6,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"},{"id":48,"name":"PlayStation 4"},{"id":49,"name":"Xbox One"},{"id":167,"name":"PlayStation 5"},{"id":169,"name":"Xbox Series X|S"}],"screenshots":[{"id":672412,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sceeu4.jpg"}],"summary":"Step into the anthology's most bloodcurdling story yet, where each of your choices once again determines who lives and who dies.

Thankfully it seems that there are also survivors, scattered across both the Southern Coast, the Archipelago and Farmland regions, putting up resistance against the invaders.","tags":[1,38,268435461,268435487],"videos":[{"id":49952,"video_id":"ou1t2WLAYB0"}]},{"id":77351,"cover":{"id":223781,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co4so5.jpg"},"name":"Super Marisa World","platforms":[{"id":6,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}],"summary":"A Touhou Doujin game based on Super Mario World, developed by Double Cluster.","tags":[268435464,536870990,536872961]},{"id":33822,"cover":{"id":86484,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co1uqc.jpg"},"name":"IMSCARED","platforms":[{"id":6,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}],"screenshots":[{"id":62011,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/bd9wbtyj9jhtzaerykzd.jpg"},{"id":62012,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/bsrwsrjsdksh6fdkkta9.jpg"},{"id":62013,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/b59mavirsdvw5lkas6zs.jpg"},{"id":62014,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/zj1xj1rwetdf0iwdda90.jpg"},{"id":62015,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/wxt3q2vw9cv9wugkliob.jpg"}],"summary":"\"I need a Heart in order to open it\"\n\nImscared is a metahorror game that protagonizes the player, putting him in a surreal first-person experience.

In a twist on the legend of King Arthur, the player controls Flicker, who lives in Camelhot castle and is in love with Princess Flame, but is not eligible to ask for her hand in marriage because he is not a knight. However, the King has announced a dragon tournament, where the winner will not only win the princess but also become the new king. \n \nAs a young Flicker, the player must collect various objects and interact with an eccentric cast of dragon and human characters in order to solve puzzles. The player's overall quest is to become a dragon knight to compete in the grand tournament and win the heart of Princess Flame. However, the player discovers an evil human plot to take over the kingdom by kidnapping the princess. \n \nAs is the case with many other graphic adventure games, the player can never die in the game or reach a point in the game where a puzzle cannot be solved. The humour in the game is heavily influenced by the British comedy of Monty Python (the game starring former Monty Python actor Terry Jones) and thus includes plenty of mild sexual innuendos, and other shenanigans. \n \nWhile the video game leaves open the possibility for a sequel, no sequel for the game was planned.","tags":[22,27,268435465,268435487,536871063,536871262,536871939,536872328,536873787,536875831,536877295,536883622,536884377]},{"id":66748,"cover":{"id":48171,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/y7aflaade8qnx20lsyp9.jpg"},"name":"Robox","platforms":[{"id":5,"name":"Wii"}],"screenshots":[{"id":181359,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/rbtufp66xr6m0ija5uc1.jpg"},{"id":181360,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/rcw2zf4zdofhtytvvakv.jpg"},{"id":181361,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/j2foomhjgtktfy7s3ji0.jpg"},{"id":181362,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/p3fnie9ulxpvb8bbo8zu.jpg"},{"id":181363,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/c6m0lb41utd47v3quqpf.jpg"},{"id":181364,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/cto9exugp6lzlldguri1.jpg"},{"id":181365,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/da91cgnsui16kacgwnm1.jpg"},{"id":181366,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/safs2eyyb6ujfjr0l8vv.jpg"},{"id":181367,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/foy5dwm5mpubca7qhjbc.jpg"},{"id":181368,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/cwfzprwzazvk1jmku08k.jpg"},{"id":181369,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/pz32wohjzukivartym3z.jpg"},{"id":181370,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/katkui0chxq1vwxwjnyw.jpg"}],"summary":"DreamBox delivers a mechanized platformer for WiiWare.","tags":[268435464,536872961]},{"id":183,"cover":{"id":179,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/jxtv9gt9ttw3pxguntyq.jpg"},"name":"Indiana Jones and His Desktop Adventures","platforms":[{"id":6,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"},{"id":14,"name":"Mac"}],"summary":"Indiana Jones and His Desktop Adventures is a overhead 2D-action adventure game released on the PC and Macintosh by Lucas Arts in 1996.

The world's magical power is called Force, which manifests in various people as control over an element or aspect of the physical laws. In ancient times, after a war sparked when Huma attempted to enslave Gajuma, both races joined forces to found the kingdom of Karegia. An unspecified time before the events of the game, Geyorkias, the ruler of a spirit race called the Sacred Beasts, sought to destroy the Huma as their dark emotions were fueling a primordial destructive force known as Yuris: the other Sacred Beasts put a stop to Geyorkias' plan by sealing him away, then acting to nullify Yuris' threat. The story opens with the death of Karegia's king, Ladras Lindblum, poisoned by the royal adviser Zilva Madigan: during his final moments, he releases his power into the world, causing many humans to become possessed by Force, including Veigue, Annie and Tytree. As the king has failed to name a successor, Karegia enters an interregnum at his death.","tags":[1,17,268435468,536870988,536870990,536871086,536871208,536871257,536871390,536871433,536871938]},{"id":81101,"name":"Progeny VR","platforms":[{"id":6,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}],"screenshots":[{"id":142500,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/dkbqiggp44mdmh5welew.jpg"},{"id":142501,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/fl2xgfgkqwmxnf2qbdns.jpg"},{"id":142502,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/px9msoxmy8wxblbskuxh.jpg"},{"id":142503,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/wavutg6qzcb5hg3pvja4.jpg"},{"id":142504,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/gofinis5b0aptrjvicrk.jpg"}],"summary":"Progeny is a VR game that takes place during those few seconds between “You Died” and videogame resurrection.

The side-scrolling platformer/shoot-em-up game was originally released on the PC, but the new Awakened Edition includes major gameplay updates and numerous refinements, for those brave enough to walk the perilous path of the daydreamer.\n\nDaydreamer: Awakened Edition is the story of the last human who rouses from an eternal sleep to an unfamiliar Earth. Aliens took over the planet thousands of years ago, and the nameless protagonist was kept in a stasis chamber as a twisted relic to memorialize their victory. However, the mysterious Immortal Gate Keeper liberates her and sets her on a dangerous expedition to the Earth’s core. Be warned though—the aliens will do whatever it takes to get their trophy back, and the Earth is filled with frightening creatures that hunger for human flesh.\n\nThe game also features special \"pets\" formed from the imagination of the Dreamer who provide support to give the player a tactical edge amongst all the chaos. The game is boss-focused and plays like a classic arcade shoot ‘em up with off-road checkpoints.","tags":[1,18,268435461,268435464,268435488,268435489,536889066,536889604,536889605,536889606,536889607],"videos":[{"id":8992,"video_id":"hWBfF2-xgHQ"}]},{"id":11094,"aggregated_rating":70.0,"cover":{"id":97348,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co2344.jpg"},"name":"Atlantis 2: Beyond Atlantis","platforms":[{"id":6,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"},{"id":14,"name":"Mac"},{"id":39,"name":"iOS"}],"screenshots":[{"id":86002,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/teghibpgtibwdavwl9az.jpg"},{"id":86003,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/qch0jtpthqkb0ijlhkzd.jpg"},{"id":86004,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/i1yihuem3wbkr9nzh8vt.jpg"},{"id":86005,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/uqcyagyybu7f39krhsvl.jpg"},{"id":86006,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/ubopt5trikd03z4ky6ub.jpg"}],"summary":"The appearance of the Super Nova of the Crab in the skies has awakened the light half of the force.

Loosely simulating American football, games are played on a five-on-five format and an arcade approach is taken, with complete disregard for the official rules. Quarterbacks can easily throw 90-yard passes, defenders have hard-hitting tackling moves, and attackers can use spin or turbo to evade opponents, or flip over them. Late hits and pass interference are no problem, and you can even taunt and trash talk. To promote aggressiveness, opponents, when properly injured, can be out for an entire season. \n \nThe game modes includes exhibition matches, a regular season and play-offs. There are detailed statistics, and you can sign, release or even create new players to build your team. Highlights can be reviewed in the instant replay mode, and you can alter the weather type, difficulty level and player size in the options.","tags":[1,268435470,536870938,536870939,536871506,536872078,536875206,536875749,536876908,536877686,536878093,536878125,536879121,536879648,536879649,536879650,536879651,536879652,536879653,536879654,536879655,536879656,536879657,536879658,536879659,536879660,536879661,536879662,536879664,536879666,536879667,536879668,536879669,536879670,536879671,536879672,536879673,536879676,536879874,536884031,536884032,536884863]},{"id":140221,"cover":{"id":213647,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co4kun.jpg"},"name":"Grim Tales: The Wishes","platforms":[{"id":6,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"},{"id":14,"name":"Mac"},{"id":39,"name":"iOS"}],"screenshots":[{"id":758400,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scg96o.jpg"},{"id":758401,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scg96p.jpg"},{"id":758402,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scg96q.jpg"},{"id":758403,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scg96r.jpg"},{"id":758404,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scg96s.jpg"},{"id":758405,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scg96t.jpg"}],"summary":"When her young son begins to wither and age before her eyes, your sister desperately requests your help.

You need to wake up, and to do so you need to climb to the highest point in the nightmare in which you reside in. Be careful though, for every unlucky slip, the less sane you might become. \n \nGameplay \n-A high-stake jumping platform game \n \nA game where only you are responsible for the outcome.

You will quickly realize this. \n \n-Hold to charge and jump \nCan you master something as simple as jumping with the right amount of power, let alone account for angles, velocity and the rotation when you jump? \n \n-Preparation is your best asset \nWhen you're in the air, you cannot change the path you have chosen. \n \nThere's no auto-save. \nPlan your jumps. The consequences can be dire. \nMake sure your angles isn't too sharp and your velocity isn't too high. \nBe prepared to make mistakes. You learn from them. \nIt's tough, but the reward is high. \nChallenge your friends to master this mental challenge. Who can do it faster and in fewest amount of jumps? \nProve that you can beat the beta-testers.
