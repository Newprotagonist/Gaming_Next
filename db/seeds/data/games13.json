Strategic combinations of equipment and skills are required to stand a chance. After each battle, a new piece of ultra-legendary equipment is acquired which provides higher stats, a passive effect and a powerful skill. Only the most synergetic combinations may prevail against the power of an ancient god! \n \nFollow delightful conversations, solve puzzles, collect collectibles and listen to some self-written music. Find metroidvania-style items and upgrade your Celestial Tea while you’re at it! Maybe you can even fill that fourth character slot with an unexpected, but powerful ally? There’s a lot to do, all crammed into a 5-hour experience.",

    "summary": "You assume the role of a student (whose gender you can choose) still aboard the flight towards the fictional Utsuho Island of Southern Japan, the location of the strangest school of the country: Hourai High School. This huge educational complex, which houses more than one million students and personnel (how is that even possible?), seems to acts as a magnet for weird youngsters and nonsensical events. And you get the privilege of a great start. Indeed, an irritated stewardess decides to send you to your destination via a shortcut... by throwing you out of the plane with a parachute. \n \nAfter a forced landing through a ceiling, here you are, at Hourai High School. The year hasn\u0027t started yet and teachers already have you in their sights. You\u0027ll get to meet new friends real soon however, particularly the guys behind the school\u0027s newspaper \"Hourai Sports\". You\u0027ll even get the chance to take the place of the editor, even though you are the one who sent him to hospital by landing on his head. But the course of your new school year will soon be disrupted by the establishment of extravagantly oppressive school laws, which seem to be manipulated from behind the throne. \n \nSome may compare this game to Mother 2, seeing the delirious scenario and modern setting. They wouldn\u0027t be entirely wrong, as Hourai Gakuen no Bouken, more than its atypical universe, shares with it classical RPG gameplay and first-person battles. The progression is pretty different, though. It\u0027s based on the school campus\u0027s map, with each of its parts constituting \"villages\" of some sort, and to which the player will be required to come back regularly to use the services housed in the main buildings. The limits of the world map will widen as the chapters that lead us through the school year unfold, and more exotic and less \"academic\" regions will gradually make their apparition.",

    "summary": "Babo Violent 2 is a freeware multiplayer game for Windows. It is a 3d Top-down shooter. The game is played over the Internet or a LAN. There are a variety of game modes to choose from, ranging from the free-for-all (Deathmatch) to the team-based (Capture the Flag). In some modes holding or defending a flag is the primary goal, where in others it is simply to obtain the most frags. For all game modes, the basic objective is to kill enemy players. Before spawning, the player is presented with a large arsenal of weapons to choose from. A few grenades and a molotov cocktail are also supplied by default and more grenades can be picked up from the ground. Some servers enable secondary functions like knives, shields or nuclear kamikaze attacks. Upon death players leave behind a health pack for healing injury, the weapon and any equipped grenades for others to pick up. After waiting for a server-specified amount of time (usually less than five seconds), players respawn and may choose another weapon—this cycle repeats for the duration of the map. After a certain allotted time (usually 15 minutes), the map changes and scores are reset as players continue in another round. Players can chat with each other throughout matches (and to their own teams, for cooperative team-based game modes).",

Grateful to this \u0027Rolla Radical, the Colonel has donated the biggest, baddest Ultra-Sheik Nuclear Attack Tank to his fellow madman\u0027s world dominating cause. \n \nNow your mission is to not only save Earth, but to inflict revenge.

Locate dozens of weapons and a truth serum that\u0027ll force enemy commanders to spill their guts. Then, destroy Vermon, Higharolla and the Earth Threatening Device with one lethal blow. All this, while staying in radio contact with a foxy spy named Jennifer and a Stealth copter pilot who\u0027ll be hovering nearby. So whaddaya think, Snake - are you commando enough to handle this Kockamamie scheme?",

One day, while out on assignment with his friend Sci Fi, he witnesses the massacre of a \"Normal\" village, by a group of Protozorqs (physical mutants). Raven and Sci Fi disobey their instructions from the Netwerk, and fight back against the Protozorqs. In the ensuing struggle, Sci Fi is captured and taken back to the Protozorqs\u0027 mountain temple. Raven vows to save her, and so gets himself captured, too. As the game starts, Raven is a prisoner in the crazy Protozorq temple, where something sinister and utterly insane seems about to happen. Apparently, Raven has to go through five ordeals, to become a \"Divo\" (a Messenger Of The New Solution). For each ordeal he completes, he receives a Vort skull. Can you complete the five ordeals, save Sci Fi and destroy the fiendish Protozorq plot, in time? \n \nChamber of the Sci-Mutant Priestess (originally entitled Kult: The Temple of Flying Saucers) is a puzzle-solving adventure game. To solve the puzzles, Raven will sometimes need to collect and trade items; but more often, usage of the eight \"psi-powers\" is required. These powers range from a simple light spell (\"Solar Eyes\") to instant-kill (\"EV\" - extreme violence) and complex psychological effects (\"Brainwarp\"). The five ordeals can be completed in any order, or even skipped altogether to reach a different ending. A time limit is imposed on the ordeals, and is calculated by turns. A \"wait\" command, which skips a turn, is also available.",

Levels are made up of several stages with mini bosses and then a large boss at the end of the level, acting as the guardian of that era.",

    "summary": "\"Stygian: Reign of the Old Ones\" is a supernatural horror roleplaying video game which takes place in the strange worlds of Howard Phillips Lovecraft. Stygian will draw the player into a bleak journey from a ruined Arkham to the very depths of the Abyss.\n\nThe gameplay experience promises a mix of rich role-playing and turn based tactical combat in an authentic illustrative 2D graphical style.\n\nIn Stygian, you\u0027ll be able to create your character from scratch with a robust selection of archetypal backgrounds with different origin stories, attributes, skills, traits and lastly belief systems which determine how your character replenishes lost sanity, also presenting unique dialog choices.\n\nThe narrative of the game is strongly connected to the works of H. P. Lovecraft. In your quest, you\u0027ll use the haunted violin of Erich Zann to lure a fiendish deity and convince the poor wretched protagonist of \"The Outsider\" to join your party among many others.\n\nThe heavy burden of fighting a desperate battle with forces beyond recognition will haunt you to the end of the game. Physical combat will be scarce and difficult, spellcasting will have deep and dangerous consequences, sanity loss will leave its marks on characters as mental illnesses and sometimes the best solution will be running away from the terrors that lurk in the night.\n\nStygian embraces the original themes of pulp and weird fiction, incorporating them into the computer roleplaying genre, promising a fresh (or putrid from another perspective) breath of air for roleplaying fans.",

    "summary": "*Now Downloaded 11 Million Times!! Well played, people!*\n*Whoa! You made us #1 in Simulation! Thanks, we love you people!*\n\nA note from the developer:\n\nHi, and thanks for taking a look at Virtual Families 2! We have been working on it for quite a while, and we’re very happy to be able to finally share this new chapter with everyone.\n\nBefore you skip down to the bullet points and screenshots, let me say a few quick words about this game, and life simulations in general: I love life simulation games. I have always been passionate about designing them, and almost everything that comes out of Last Day of Work is a life sim of some kind. This one, in particular, thrills me so much because it is designed to have a life of its own: unpredictable and so different each time I play it, and each time another player plays it. I love that the story unfolds differently for everyone who plays it, and your experience with the game might be wildly different from your friends’ experience.\n\nDesigning this type of game, however, has its own special challenges. The main challenge is that EVERYTHING in life is a great idea to add to a game like this. There are SO many great ideas, and we simply cannot put them all in at launch. So, while I hope the game captivates you as much as it does us, there will inevitably be things that you feel are missing and you would love to see added (tell us!).\n\nWe plan to update the content in this game. We want to add pets, hidden puzzles, more storyline, more events, tons of new things to buy, and the list goes on and on. We will also continue to tune and deepen all the game\u0027s inner workings that control happiness, health, and everything else. While the game has been balanced to be playable for free and without purchasing anything, we hope that you will find something compelling enough in the game to give us support so that we can continue to create fun new updates.\n\nEnjoy Virtual Families 2!

    "summary": "Grim Legions is a fantasy turn-based strategy game, played on a hex grid. In Grim Legions, you control units that move around the map trying to capture towns. Each turn, the towns recruit more units. The aim of the game is simply to wipe out your enemy (destroy all their troops and capture all their towns). There can be up to 4 players, and you can make alliances with other players.\n\nThere are three different types of troop: infantry, archers and cavalry. There\u0027s not much difference between these types, archers are just better than infantry, and cavalry better than archers. Unlike a lot of other games, you can combine multiple troop types in one unit (or \"legion\"), and you can split and merge them as much as you like.\n\nMap generation is randomized, but you have a lot of control over it. E.g. if you get sick of your units taking ages to move through the mountains, you can just generate a map without mountains. You can also decide how much of the map you want to be water (which no troops can move through), from 0% to 60%. There are also 3 map sizes to choose from. This means - despite the relatively simple gameplay - there are quite a few different scenarios. You can end up spending a lot more time playing this game than you think!\n\nGrim Legions is currently in open beta. You can download it for Windows or Linux, or play the web-based version (which uses WebGL)",

    "summary": "Formula One 05 for the PlayStation 2 was released in Europe on July 1, 2005, and in Australia later that year. It featured the \u0027Career Mode\u0027 concept from Formula One 04, which allows players to work their way through the Formula One teams over the course of five years (albeit a repeat version of the 2005 season each time). This game also supports EyeToy: Cameo, allowing players to place their own face on a driver when creating their profile, but unlike F1 04, though they cannot choose their own helmet. The cover athletes are Jenson Button, David Coulthard and Narain Karthikeyan. \n \nPlayers start out testing for a smaller teams (Minardi, Jordan and Red Bull Racing (Like in F1 04, a generic car does exist, but it is only used in Time Attack mode)). Players then work their way up the grid throughout their \u0027career\u0027 through a mixture of good tests and impressive race performances. As before, consistently poor performances will lead to dismissal from the player\u0027s current team. There are also occasional \u0027shoot-out\u0027 tests against the team\u0027s second driver (or third driver, depending on the player\u0027s current status within the team), in which both drivers complete a set of five laps each and whoever has the fastest overall time (one time based on the fastest first, second and third sectors added together) then takes the race seat. Players can now also view trophies they have received from winning races and championships after each is won in Career Mode for the first time. \n \nAs with F1 04, \"classic\" cars (like the Williams FW11) are unlocked once certain terms are fulfilled, such as winning a World Championship. Helmets for Career Mode are also unlocked, and there is also a hidden track (the Detroit street circuit which was used for Detroit Grand Prix and the Paul Ricard circuit in France([citation needed])) available for Time Attack Mode. Notably, since this game was developed before the change in the qualifying regulations midway through the actual 2005 season, this game runs the original \"aggregated times\" format from the early part of the actual 2005 season in every race in Race Weekend, Championship and Career Mode. This game also has Net Play available. A notable credit is the opening video features the song \"Butterflies \u0026 Hurricanes\" from English alternative rock band Muse. \n \nFor the first time in a number of years, the fans agreed that this was a massive improvement in the series and the shot in the arm it had so desperately needed. A lot of people had criticised Studio Liverpool for the lack of ambition and progress since the series appeared on the PS2 platform up to that point. With the release of Formula One 05, people saw that great strides had been made by Studio Liverpool in terms of gameplay handling and AI. \n \nHowever, there were criticisms in terms of the AI being too easy on the hardest of settings, and about the penalty system that had been introduced on Formula One 05 which automatically reduced the revs during a penalty instead of the traditional \"drive-through\" penalties that previous games had seen. Overall though, the fans agreed that apart from these minor issues, Studio Liverpool had redeveloped the brand as a stepping stone for improvement for the inevitable release of the 2006 edition. \n \nSee also[edit]",

    "summary": "PlanetSide chronicles the efforts of three factions as they fight for territorial control over ten different continents on the planet Auraxis. Players take on the role of individual soldiers fighting for one of the three factions within the game, and can specialize in various fields such as combat vehicle crewman, infantry, invisible infiltrator or a variety of combat support roles such as combat medic or combat engineer. The game is played primarily in a first person perspective, with the option of third-person.\n\nUnlike most shooting games, in which small-scale matches take place in essentially an instanced map, PlanetSide battles can involve hundreds of players in a single fight. PlanetSide battles concern control over territory and strategic points, and can cause repercussions to all three factions. To date, PlanetSide remains one of the few MMOFPS games ever created. A sequel, PlanetSide 2, was released in November, 2012. On January 24, 2014 Sony Online Entertainment announced that the game was going to be free-to-play in April 2014. The game was officially launched as free to play on April 29, after several delays.\n\nOn July 1st 2016, at 4:00pm PT, Planetside servers went offline permanently.",

Never in your military career have you been in such a hot spot, as the world\u0027s most threatening power, Sheik Toxic Moron, deploys his arsenal of TechnoScorch Weapons. To achieve total victory over 4 intense levels, you must possess numerous skills, including precision reflexes for air combat, a cut throat mentality for land assaults, the brains to gather secrets from underground informants, and a keen sense for surviving 3-D battle mazes. If you\u0027ve got the guts to match those skills, then prepare for action. Because it\u0027ll really heat up the second you blast across the Sheik\u0027s firing line, piloting the world\u0027s most advanced super weapon - the Mach 4 Laser Invasion Helijet, which can go from hovering to a six \"G\" vertical climb in a heartbeat. From the moment you activate your Vulcan Cannons and Sidewinder Missiles, you\u0027ll take dead aim on an insane assault, featuring Anti-Copter Rocket Launchers, High-Altitude Bombers and Aerial Mines. But the battle\u0027s just begun, and there\u0027s no time to kill between firefights!",

The game features a character-switching feature, similar to the spin-off, Samurai Warriors: Chronicles, with which players can take two characters into battles simultaneously, and freely switch between the two. Two new moves, \"Hyper Attacks\" and \"Rage Mode\" are featured in this game: Hyper Attacks is a secondary moveset available to all characters that allows the player to sweep through and clear out crowd of enemies with a dashing animation, although it is useless against enemy officers, as they will either deflect it or are otherwise immune against it. Rage Mode renders the player invincible for a period of time, and also enhances the player\u0027s attacks as well as empowering their Muso attack by using the Spirit Gauge. Duels are featured, which occur when player-controlled characters meet with enemy officers under specific conditions.\n\nExclusive Content:\nSpecial Anime Pack 10th anniversary Collector\u0027s Edition packaging\nSAMURAI WARRIORS: Legend of the Sanada anime (Blu-ray Disc)\nSAMURAI WARRIORS 4 (PS4 game)\nSAMURAI WARRIORS 4 Official Soundtrack (CD)\nSpecial Costume Pack 4: Garcia, Ina, Nene and Oichi (DLC)",

Your team has been selected to go down and investigate problems at the Real Meat factory, in which all of the equipment has started to simultaneously malfunction. Technicians sent to repair the machinery have gone missing without explanation. The UPA\u0027s (Urban Protection Agency) orders are clear: prepare for the descent.\n\nProject Eden is a 3D shooter with an emphasis on puzzle-solving. You\u0027ll lead a squad consisting of four UPA agents: Carter Dorlan, Andre Herderman, Minoko Molensky, and Amber Torrelson. Each operative has his or her own special ability that you\u0027ll need to master in order to progress. As Carter, use your knack for interrogation and nimble fingers to gain information and unlock doors. When you need something fixed and in a hurry, Andre is your man. Computer terminals are no match for Minoko\u0027s hacking talents. Last but not least, Amber can traverse hazardous environments with nary a scratch and she\u0027ll be your weapons expert. Brave the lowest strata and prepare to go through hell in Project Eden!

It features an original story based on the Alfheim Online arc and continues the timeline from the previous games. For the first time in the series, players are able to play as characters other than Kirito. In addition, players are able to create their own custom characters, though the story mode will still progress as if you were playing as Kirito. Parties of up to three characters may be formed, up from two in the prior games. In keeping with being set in Alfheim Online, players are able to fly as well as walk on the ground. However, walking within dungeons is mandatory. Auto-attacks are disabled while in flight mode, but players may instead target individual parts of an enemy\u0027s body as they see fit. In addition, this game adds the ability to use magic to attack enemies or to provide support to one\u0027s party. The game is the first in the series to allow for four-person online multiplayer.",

Donning the bodies of mortal vassals, they could live in the realms of man forever. The great hero and warlock Harbinger was the only one who could stand up to their power. One by one he hunted the Revenants, taking their spirits and casting them into the Well of Souls. Alas, the Revenants survived. As a young man you will travel to meet your uncle in the town of Madrigal. There, your destiny draws you into the path that Harbinger trod - to confront the Revenants and banish their souls back to the Well forever. Your travels will take you far from Madrigal, to the ruined kingdoms of Horath, the ancient empire of Thardolin, and through the lost city of Talendrah. You will brave searing deserts and icy plains. You will have to seek answers among the living and the dead.\n\nCustomizable combat and magic system that can be as simple or as complex as you like.\nCompelling story with many twists and turns will keep you hooked for hours.\nDynamic music, high quality voice acting, and more than one possible ending.",

A demolition derby is more of an American pastime, primarily at state fairs and the like. Participants take an old beat down car, strip it of all the glass and other \"dangerous\" elements, spray paint the car and decorate it to their liking, then beat it to death at the main event. The last vehicle standing is the victor. A Banger Race is more practiced in the UK. Races take place on small courses with pits and hills, and drivers are encouraged to send their opponents off course. Courses can have hazards and obstacles, and the \"figure 8\" shaped course is a staple of the race. No matter whether it\u0027s Banger races or demolition derbys, the fact is that everyone love to see the everyman take it to the mat and come out a victor, and that\u0027s what Mayhem is all about.",

Players are allowed full roam of the mansion, once they collect enough Shriveled Souls inside their Beacon of Souls, a special lantern designed to collect the various lesser ghosts throughout the rooms. Though Zeke handles his quest alone, he is aided by the help of Madame Leota, and six friendly ghosts who will provide hints and items throughout the journey. As Zeke solves puzzles, completes various tasks, and helps rid the house of its evil spirits, these spiritual companions will provide Soul Gems, which amplify the power of the Soul Beacon.
