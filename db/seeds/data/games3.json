It was made for Ludum Dare 43 (Theme: \"Sacrifices must be made\"). \n \nThe game is made of two parts: a map view, where you can command your group across a procedurally generated world with forests, cities and plains and random encounters: while travelling through the lands, you will randomly encounter friendly or evil people, with whom you can communicate or fight. \n \nAt the moment the game is rather a prototype and we appreciate every feedback we can get. The current version should provide a basic game flow and includes some features that were not finished in time for LudumDare.",

A bit far from the usual cliché of the city of love. A gigantic city, always in movement, and full of very different people. Every one of them has a story to share. Put together, all these bits of stories will create a unique experience on the way to find the killer\u0027s identity.\"",

Some of them can be dispatched of by a jump on their heads.\n\nThe main difference to the other versions of this game is a unique level design.

The main objective of each location is to find all the objects listed at the bottom of the screen, and afterward collect one of Janet\u0027s body parts. In later stages, the player has to pick up machine parts instead of the bride\u0027s pieces. Janet and the machine are gradually assembled on two separate tabs at the left side of the screen showing the game progress. The hint button highlights the position of one of the required items and is unlimited, but takes some time to recharge after use.",

Looking for something a bit more game-related? Well, AUSTIN POWERS has those in spades, too. The largest of the games, \"Kin-Evil,\" has Dr. Evil and Mini-Me riding their scooter through a variety of stunt-packed stages. Also available for your enjoyment are the \"Mojo Maze,\" a takeoff on PAC-MAN, \"Domination,\" a board game similar to OTHELLO, and finally \"Rock or Paper or Scissors,\" which pits you against an AUSTIN POWERS character in a play of the classic game. Customize the backdrop of all this fun by choosing wallpaper, screensavers, sound effects, and more. You can also link up to play some of the games with a friend or foe using either AUSTIN POWERS: Oh Behave! or AUSTIN POWERS: Welcome to My Underground Lair.",

He\u0027s got himself sucked into a Rebellion against the mad Emperor, and now he’s got fateful choices to make.

Worse, he’s still in love with the Emperor’s adopted daughter, who he met in sword fu school. He’s got dozens of ways to screw this up; but is can he find a way to win his war? \n \nStories: The Path of Destinies is madcap epic fantasy where each choice you make takes you into a different story.

Fires burn brightly throughout the galaxies, illuminating carnage and slaughter as mankind defends itself from ancient enemies. Hardened forces collide with one goal in mind, the complete extermination of their opposition. Control one of four unique races in head-to-head or cooperative multiplayer action, where faith, skill, and strategy are requisites in ruling the universes. \n \nWinter Assault: \nThe expansion pack to the award winning Warhammer 40,000: Dawn of War will build upon the most exciting, visceral, front-line battlefield ever seen in an RTS game. Lost amongst the ruins of a leveled city lies an Emperor Class Titan, a war vessel of untold power forged in the planet-wide furnaces of Mars, and revered by billions as the epitome of Imperial dominance. The one who controls it will command the power to destroy, or defend, a world. The Imperials will summon it to overcome great evil, Chaos will corrupt it for their own designs, Orks will destroy it in their bloodlust and Eldar will disregard it in their arrogance. \n \nDark Crusade: \nWarhammer 40,000: Dawn of War - Dark Crusade will feature two new playable races, the Tau Empire and the Necrons, bringing the number of totally unique races to an unprecedented seven. In addition to the two new playable races, Dark Crusade will feature an all-new single player campaign centering on the conquest of a \"meta-map,\" with each territory captured giving tangible rewards to the occupying force. A greatly expanded multiplayer component and a completely unique economy model for the Necrons will present gamers with the most compelling Dawn of War game to-date."

The player gives orders to the felynes to progress to the end of quests instead of having direct control over them. The game also uses a much more cartoonish art style as opposed to the realism seen in other Monster Hunter games. More emphasis is placed on style and village management. A few Hello Kitty items are also available in the game. \n \nMonster Hunter Diary Poka Poka Airou Village G is an expansion pack and was released on August 10, 2011 in Japan. \n \nMonster Hunter Diary Giri Giri Airou Village is a series of ten television shorts developed to help advertise Poka Poka Airou Village. They feature felynes attempting quests and almost invariably failing at them.

Your \"self\" is a wave too, with opposite polarity. Instead of manipulating some local point on the screen, you manipulate a global wave pattern. You destroy Frequons by achieving destructive interference with them.",

    "summary": "Frontline is a first-person shooter where players take control of the protagonist player character in a first-person perspective where they fight through levels set during the Second World War against the Wehrmacht using historical weaponry of the era, performing a series of military operations. Briefings take place at the start of each mission, which advance the plot and introduce new characters. Each mission is structured through a number of linear levels, each with differing locations, levels of action and styles of gameplay. Initially the player character begins on the frontlines during D-Day backed up by other computer AI-controlled soldiers with an emphasis on fast action-orientated gun-based gameplay. As the story progress however, the player character is sent on a variety of other missions including a number of covert and undercover operations in locations such as military based, German-occupied towns and manors, submarines and countryside settings. The player character is tasked with objectives during levels that range from infiltration, espionage, rescue and recon. Because of the variety between missions and locations, gameplay also changes pace. While many missions involve Allied assaults on German targets others include elements of stealth and exploration. For example one selections of missions has the player detach from an allied raid to infiltrate a German U-Boat in order to get to a secret facility while another has them rendezvous and sneak into a German headquarters in disguise to rescue an operative. Many missions are performed solo yet some include an AI companion for backup. Health is determined by a health bar that can be replenished using a selection \"medikits\" found throughout levels with varying degrees of effect.\n\nDuring missions, players can earn medals by the end of each level be meeting requirements such as completions of objectives, eliminating an amount of enemies and maintaining a percentage of health throughout, all represented by a bronze, silver or gold star.",

In 1975 John was accused and convicted of murdering two coal miners. During the investigation, John claimed it was the Hollow Creek Witch responsible for the disappearance of the miners.\n\nPlayers take on the role of Eddie, a character with a checkered past who has psychic abilities that allows him to see things from the past while touching items found throughout the game. The game will start off with Eddie being found along a lonely road by police. The police bring Eddie in for questioning in regards to the whereabouts of the remaining film makers. As Eddie tells his story, players are taken to that point in the story and play through what happened at that point.",

Set somewhere after the year 2010, Nebula Fighter puts the player into the role of a lone ship pilot who needs to break through the defenses of a space-faring alien race. The twist is that instead of an alien invasion scenario, the humans are actually the aggressors bent on conquering the alien homeworld. Nebula Fighter features a variety of weapons, which can be powered up by picking upgrades during play. Each level ends with a battle against a unique boss. Once a boss is defeated, the player can pick up its weapon to use in the next level.",

Gameplay is composed of several different types of missions, each broken up into short mini-games.\nThe first part of the game requires the player to activate oxygen and hydrogen pumps as well as get additional crew members into the shuttle within a strict time limit by moving an elevator up and down and avoiding moving bumpers. Then, the player must successfully launch the shuttle into space by performing quick time events that correspond to particular shuttle launch maneuvers such as booster rocket separation. Once in space, one of several missions will be played where the player must control the astronaut by maneuvering him around hazards, replenish his air supply before the timer runs out, and deliver components for the International Space Station to their correct locations. A cosmonaut from the Soviet Union must also be rescued in the game.\nFinally, the player must land the shuttle by again performing Quick Time Events that correspond to landing maneuvers before finally landing at Edwards Air Force Base.",

    "summary": "Gaia Seed is a horizontally scrolling shooter from Techno Soleil. The game comes from the fabulous line of classically-styled Japanese shoot \u0027em ups, bursting at the seams with parallax scrolling, screen-filling bosses and other classic effects that you could count on from the games of this era. But the real beauty of GaiaSeed lies in its subtlety. The game has tight control, precise bullet collision, and a simple powerup system, while the haunting soundtrack stands out for its techno/ambiance mood, adding to the subliminal nature of the work. \n \nYou have a single ship choice and three difficulties. Gaming veterans will want to start on HARD, which differs only slightly if at all from NORMAL, and isn\u0027t particularly challenging anyway. You get two extra credits in NORMAL, for a total of 5, which is ample if you want to credit feed your way to the best ending. No one should touch EASY, since it limits you to reaching Stage 4. There are 7 stages with 3 possible endings, none of which are affected by credit usage. \n \nPower-ups consist of 2 main shots (RED and BLUE), 2 sub-weapons (YELLOW and GREEN), and an eIntense Shot\u0027 based on your main weapon which basically acts like a Power Bomb. Main weapons stack up to 3 times (RED: starts on 1 shot then 2, 3 and finally 4 shots), sub-weapons don\u0027t stack. Lose a ship and you lose your sub-weapon, while your main weapon goes down one level. \n \nBLUE is the Laser Shot, a straight line weapon with strong frontal attack which increases in thickness and power as you stack it. The laser\u0027s eintense shot\u0027 is a massive sausage of light cutting across the screen and wiping out all in its path. RED is Needle Shot. This is your typical V-shot weapon. Less powerful than BLUE, but when stacked 3 times has a wide ranging spread. The intense shot is a series of blue homing orbs target enemies and weak points on bosses, making this the best main weapon. GREEN is the Cipher Wave, the best sub-weapon since it fires four blobs which home in on enemies and can attack craft which are behind you, which is essential during boss fights. YELLOW is the Energy Blaster and acts like an additional V-shot weapon. Absolute rubbish. \n \nWith such a simple weapons set most players will opt for a RED and GREEN combo for the game\u0027s duration. Which isn\u0027t a criticism. Gaia Seed doesn\u0027t distract you with superfluity; it\u0027s functional, with a focus on dodging and shooting. What\u0027s especially cool, and sets it apart from other shmups, is that both your health bar and Intense Shot bar are continuously recharging. This effectively gives you infinitely spawning power bombs and infinite health - but it doesn\u0027t break the game\u0027s balancing. \n \nEnemies frequently use screen-filling beam-based draining weapons, forcing you to let off a volley of shots and then scramble out of the beam\u0027s attack before your life is fully drained. With bosses this creates some intense battles of endurance - especially if you\u0027re trying to beat them by letting the timer run down (those are some pretty intense 120 seconds). After escaping a draining blast you can lick your wounds at the screen\u0027s edge, healing while avoiding bullet patterns. The patterns are fairly busy but without ever reaching danmaku levels of weaving. A slight comparison could be made to Deep Blue on the PC Engine, which had a recharging health bar and encouraged enemy avoidance (as pointed out by Mag Weasel). \n \nA mention must go to Gaia Seed\u0027s timed bosses. Defeating them by letting the timer reach zero doesn\u0027t do much during the main game apart from giving you a sense of accomplishment, but if you want to see the best ending you\u0027ll let the two final Stage 7 bosses\u0027 live. \n \nVisually almost everything is sprite based, though it varies in terms of quality. The first stage contains hundreds of massive though pixelated objects moving around, while the second has some interesting Mode 7 styled screen rotation effects. Stage 3 contains some decent parallax scrolling, though not as good as in Thunder Force IV. Subsequent levels are reasonable but without flair. \n \nThe stand out element of Gaia Seed though has to be its soundtrack, which almost warrants download alone. It\u0027s extremely unconventional, being a blend of ambient music with chanting, classical music, hip-hop and thumping techno. Stage 2\u0027s track almost sounds as if it\u0027s been taken from Panzer Dragoon Saga. It\u0027s eclectic, strange, and very good. The sole composer was Xacs Ishikawa, also known as Naoto Ishikawa, a fairly obscure composer connected to works like Psyvariar and Touhou. Interestingly, he also collaborated with Harumi Shiina to remix Koji Endo\u0027s King\u0027s Field soundtrack, to create an album called Invitation to the Graveyard ~ King\u0027s Field I Arrange Collection.",

One day, he meets a strange girl, Kirari Shiino, at work and before he knows it, they\u0027ve formed a punk band. \n \nThe band consists of Shikanosuke, Kirari, his childhood friend Chie Isurugi, and a rich but weak young lady by the name of Sarina Kashiwara. The four of them are members of the Second Literature Club, which has hardly any active members and is already scheduled to be disbanded. This band is their chance to stand out and give one final farewell at the Culture Festival. \n \nThe challenge was foolhardy, but after eccentric training they managed to succeed and rock out the peaceful Oubi Academy with their debut performance. That should have been it. \nThey were satisfied. \nThey should have returned to their normal lives. \nHowever, their final performance at a local Live House became a hit on the Internet and requests for their performance start flying in from far and wide. \n \nOne problem: exams are coming up and their parents are opposed to the band! \n \nWho cares! \n \nThe four of them embark on their final adventure, a long tour of Japan, armed with their dreams and their instruments, all aboard a rickety van that could fall apart at any moment.",

Money is earned after each level for the purpose of upgrading the player\u0027s vehicle. Players can improve their engines, purchase extra lives, shovels that can dig better, and weapons to improve the odds on the playing field. A kill ratio is required to be met in order to reach the next stage. Otherwise, the player remains in the current level. \n \nAfter finishing all 48 levels, the game proclaims that the \"battle is over\" and that the player becomes \"the new champion.\" The final scene in the game is where the player looks over the sunset with his girlfriend along with the closing credits.",

If the cursor stops looking at the sword, your grip will be lost and the sword will fall back to its original position.\n\nThe Steam version includes an online mode in which the sword gets longer and heavier each time someone pulls it out.",

Players never need worry about running out of ammunition because Wolves have their own distinct advantages – such as running on walls then dropping onto enemies unexpectedly. In certain modes, players can even harness special Wolf mutations, such as Ghost Wolves, which can turn invisible. \n \n \n \nVariety is the spice of life; Wolf Team has several addictive game modes to choose from. Just want to engage in an all-out no-holds-barred melee? Fire up a traditional Deathmatch. Interested in joining forces with other players to wage a more cerebral, tactical battle? Try Conquest mode, in which players to work as a team to capture as many bases as possible, or Destruction mode, in which one team tries to demolish the other team\u0027s base. Wolf Team also features a large selection of weapons players can acquire as they progress through the game.",
