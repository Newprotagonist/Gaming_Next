is set in the 22nd century, and the player flies a futuristic fighter craft called the R-9a \"Arrowhead\", named for its shape, and because it is the ninth model in the 'R' series of fighter craft (but it is the first of the series to actually be used in combat; the previous models were all prototypes). The mission is to 'blast off and strike the evil Bydo Empire'. The R- in the series title originally stood for \"ray\", as in a ray of light. It was a reference to the many different types of ray-like weapons in the first R-Type. his was later retconned in R-Type Final to refer specifically to the production code as well as a term of endearment for the player fighter craft, the \"Round Canopy\". \n \nThe original R-Type was well received by most gaming critics. However, it was also infamous for its relentless difficulty. It earned 7th place in IGN's Top 10 most difficult games to beat. The gameplay of R-Type is noticeably distinct among shoot 'em ups. Invariably the player will lose, not because of an inequality in firepower, but because of the design of the levels themselves. There is usually a 'correct' way to get through a level, but players must learn these by experience - i.e. by losing and restarting from earlier in the level. The game innovated with its weapon system compared to contemporary shooters, featuring a chargeable shot (beam-meter), and detachable 'force' pod; levels were designed to require different tactics and ideal weapons (air-air, diagonal, or air-ground laser).","tags":[1,18,268435461,268435489,536870915,536871078,536871859,536871882,536871971,536873064,536874398,536875075,536875434,536875870,536876028,536876120,536876435,536876633,536876634,536876845,536877435,536877689,536877744,536880079,536880227,536880654,536880655,536881123,536881886,536882680,536883100,536884894],"videos":[{"id":2466,"video_id":"P-WPX4AsvOE"}]},{"id":135258,"cover":{"id":162588,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co3hgc.jpg"},"name":"F-Zero X Climax","platforms":[{"id":4,"name":"Nintendo 64"}],"screenshots":[{"id":389424,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc8chc.jpg"},{"id":389425,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc8chd.jpg"},{"id":389426,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc8che.jpg"}],"summary":"This hack replaces all GFX, textures and circuits of F-Zero X.\nAll the 24 F-Zero X tracks have been remade, the 24 new circuits are from F-Zero Climax but very large changes were made, including 3D, absent the GBA version.

For the first time ever, friends can have fun playing through levels they create for one another. The Wii U GamePad controller makes it so easy for anyone to create levels; it may feel like simply sketching out ideas on paper. Players can enjoy a seemingly endless supply of inventive Mario levels from players around the world. \n \nThe game includes a book totaling about 100 pages that illustrates the boundless possibilities in Super Mario Maker. Nintendo will also release two special Mario amiibo figures to celebrate the 30th anniversary of the original Super Mario Bros. game. Tapping these amiibo in Super Mario Maker adds a Big Mushroom power-up to your course, allowing Mario to grow big and bust blocks from any direction, as well as adding a retro visual filter to the game, reminiscent of older cathode ray tube televisions. In addition, many other amiibo will also be compatible with Super Mario Maker through the use of a new item called the Mystery Mushroom. This item allows Mario to take the appearance of many other characters, such as Link, Kirby or Wii Fit Trainer, complete with character-specific animations and sound effects. These character costumes can be unlocked by completing the 100 Mario Challenge mode and many can also be unlocked if the player taps the amiibo of the character to the Wii U GamePad.","tags":[1,35,268435464,536870969,536871161,536871186,536871192,536871208,536871443,536871555,536871923,536872211,536872245,536872617,536872961,536873024,536873125,536873141,536874136,536874706,536874813,536875073,536875075,536875083,536875101,536875130,536875199,536875200,536875201,536875205,536875209,536875286,536875346,536875362,536875377,536875391,536875392,536875606,536875619,536875667,536875740,536875754,536875823,536875901,536875924,536875925,536875928,536875959,536875961,536875962,536876034,536876081,536876227,536876230,536876255,536876270,536876271,536876291,536876353,536876544,536876546,536876547,536876651,536877023,536877050,536877051,536877052,536877062,536877065,536877080,536877082,536877083,536877084,536877085,536877086,536877088,536877089,536877092,536877093,536877096,536877104,536877106,536877112,536877432,536877543,536877717,536878098,536878154,536878157,536878160,536878395,536878398,536878606,536878608,536878732,536879098,536879243,536879469,536879791,536879802,536879803,536879804,536880106,536880107,536880108,536881011,536881356,536881489,536881490,536881491,536881492,536881493,536881494,536881495,536881496,536885987,536885988],"videos":[{"id":2606,"video_id":"NLS458ekSEI"}]},{"id":147684,"cover":{"id":204837,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co4e1x.jpg"},"name":"Gnome More War","platforms":[{"id":130,"name":"Nintendo Switch"}],"screenshots":[{"id":448089,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc9lqx.jpg"},{"id":448090,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc9lqy.jpg"},{"id":448091,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc9lqz.jpg"},{"id":448092,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc9lr0.jpg"},{"id":448093,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc9lr1.jpg"}],"summary":"It was a fine day in the farm, and Freija was just chatting with her friend Filipo about the upcoming harvest when out of nowhere, a gnome passed by and stole from their barn!

In case one happens to show up in your home: don’t ask for that poker game. That’s already been taken care of, thanks to New World Computing. NWC-mastermind Jon Van Caneghem invited three class B TV celebrities of the mid-90s for a day of green-screen filming. The result is called Multimedia Celebrity Poker. \n \nIf you’re into TV series, then you’ll probably have no trouble recognizing the faces of your opponents. Sitting at the poker table are Jonathan „Riker“ Frakes (Star Trek: Next Generation), appearing somewhat tight-lipped; talkative comedian Joe Piscopo (Saturday Night Live), showing off his array of impersonations; and aging starlet Morgan Fairchild (Hotel, Falcon Crest), sitting stiff and generally trying not to look too lost. Digitized video clips, seamlessly integrated into the main frame, depict all actions and movements of the stars -- dealing, calling, playing cards. Separate clips for the three actors are played simultaneously to avoid „freezing“ of single persons; all are continuously in motion. The celebrities comment on the their cards and your success to create a relaxed and intimate atmosphere. The number of different statements is quite limited though; prepare to learn those one-liners by heart. \n \nMultimedia Celebrity Poker knows eight different variants of poker. You may play combinations of five cards or seven, stud or draw, lo-ball or high, deuces wild or normal. In any case, it’s always you against the computer; a multiplayer option is not included. In addition to a relaxed round among friends, you can choose to advance levels in a tournament. You win if all opponents are broke, although nobody will undress at that point. Luckily. The program’s poker skill is mediocre; it’s playing fairly straight, rarely risking a bluff. The playing style of the three celebrities does not differ. \n \nReady to join the game?

The objective of the source material is to reach the top of each level, taking out any enemies in the way by firing magical rainbows that can trap or eliminate foes as well as providing bridges for the player to walk on. Rainbows remain onscreen for a short amount of time but can be ?broken? by the player if they jump on them. Once broken, the rainbow will fall off the screen, taking out the first enemy it touches. The game also features a pleasing bonus item system where dispatched enemies leave behind items of food that have varying point values and power-ups that have a range of helpful effects. The major feature of this re-interpretation is shifting the entire game away from traditional controls by implementing a global touchscreen control system which radically alters the way in which the game plays. The game is also displayed across both screens of the DS. Rather than being fired by a button press, rainbows are now drawn directly onto the gameplay area using the stylus and movement is executed by dragging the player?s character around the levels. The objective is still to reach the top of the level, but the time limit has been extended to account for the player being unable to move and use rainbows simultaneously. Rainbows are now broken by pressing the stylus onto them.","tags":[1,268435464,536871958,536873064]},{"id":120887,"cover":{"id":76241,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co1mtt.jpg"},"name":"HyperCore: Out of Dimension","platforms":[{"id":6,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}],"screenshots":[{"id":320135,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc6v0n.jpg"},{"id":320136,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc6v0o.jpg"},{"id":320137,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc6v0p.jpg"},{"id":320138,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc6v0q.jpg"}],"tags":[1,268435461]},{"id":126236,"cover":{"id":140387,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co30bn.jpg"},"name":"Escape: Mouse Gun","platforms":[{"id":6,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"},{"id":14,"name":"Mac"}],"screenshots":[{"id":345892,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc7ew4.jpg"},{"id":345893,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc7ew5.jpg"},{"id":345894,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc7ew6.jpg"},{"id":345895,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc7ew7.jpg"},{"id":345896,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc7ew8.jpg"},{"id":345897,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc7ew9.jpg"},{"id":345898,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc7ewa.jpg"},{"id":345899,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc7ewb.jpg"},{"id":345900,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc7ewc.jpg"},{"id":345901,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc7ewd.jpg"},{"id":345902,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc7ewe.jpg"}],"summary":"MOUSEGUN: a RUN’N’GUN in a RAT MAZE.","tags":[1,268435461,268435488,268435489],"videos":[{"id":47204,"video_id":"_ogVM_jodpk"}]},{"id":43247,"cover":{"id":131122,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co2t6a.jpg"},"name":"Perfect Ace 2: The Championships","platforms":[{"id":8,"name":"PlayStation 2"}],"screenshots":[{"id":422285,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc91u5.jpg"},{"id":422286,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc91u6.jpg"},{"id":422287,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sc91u7.jpg"}],"summary":"Following on from the success of Perfect Ace: Pro Tournament Tennis, which sold 80,000 units across Europe last summer, Oxygen Interactive have announced they are to launch a sequel title Perfect Ace 2: The Championships in time for the Wimbledon Championships.

Speedball 2100 pits two teams of nine players in a cage-like arena where they attempt to score by sending a steel ball past the goalie and into the small goal box. You can bounce the ball off the walls, and you can send opponents flying to the floor with a friendly shoulder charge. Fans of the predecessor will appreciate this sequel.\n\nSpeedball 2100, released only for the PlayStation, is a 3D version of Speedball 2 with more options such as choosing and renaming any team, instead of having to play with Brutal Deluxe. This version, released in September 2000, failed to win over gamers and press because it lacked the speed and gameplay of the originals. Speedball 2100 will be released on Evercade as part of the Bitmap Brothers Collection 1.","tags":[1,268435470,536870938,536870939,536872078],"videos":[{"id":4125,"video_id":"BwxiGQOo6AE"},{"id":4130,"video_id":"KOixphnLY4I"}]},{"id":77145,"cover":{"id":56050,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/kooxdsouovab96a3jums.jpg"},"name":"Axis & Allies","platforms":[{"id":6,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}],"summary":"A WWII real-time-strategy game based on the popular board game and Timegate Studios previous game series, Kokan.","tags":[39,268435467,268435471,536870931,536871304,536871707,536871924,536872074,536872245,536872383,536872649,536872658,536872733,536873753,536873822,536874694,536874743,536874906,536874947,536875137,536875257,536875271,536875358,536875361,536875464,536875523,536875572,536876104,536876232,536876262,536876263,536876274,536876281,536876282,536876365,536876367,536876407,536876499,536876583,536876687,536876800,536876939,536877501,536877555,536877801,536877808,536877820,536877928,536877948,536879605,536879607,536879608,536879609,536879610,536879624,536879625,536879629,536880295,536880619,536880816,536881651,536882908,536883035,536883612,536883952,536884022,536884173,536884493,536884504,536884512,536884914]},{"id":56658,"cover":{"id":108559,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co2brj.jpg"},"name":"Jigsaw Puzzles","platforms":[{"id":6,"name":"PC (Microsoft Windows)"}],"screenshots":[{"id":122390,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/ubenka60pfjhegafmxiw.jpg"},{"id":122391,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/oil6dzvc2sic1rdigdnh.jpg"},{"id":122392,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/iukotlf1qrtzzlkexpds.jpg"},{"id":122393,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/t1lfluubryfxpygtyp8e.jpg"},{"id":122394,"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/n5qpozmomhrxukcfxcmm.jpg"}],"summary":"Jigsaw Puzzles is designed for kids aged 2-12 and parents to have fun together.
